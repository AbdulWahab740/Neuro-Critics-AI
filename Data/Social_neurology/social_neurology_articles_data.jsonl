Our focus on designing a digital program was driven by the need for greater accessibility and scalability of such interventions. Studies have shown that mindfulness and compassion training in children and parents can benefit interpersonal behaviors and even improve stress physiology [\nIn the interventional program that we designed and implemented, parent-child dyads jointly participated in working through 10-minute attention-to-breath mindfulness exercises in each session alongside prompts for compassion cultivation. Each session was kept brief to facilitate adherence in busy families, and up to 30 training sessions were available for families to practice over 3 months. We referred to the program as Cooperative Compassion (CoCo) training, and both parent and child underwent the practices together. To evaluate the outcomes of this intervention, we used self-report mental health measures at baseline, after training, and 3-month follow-up and also measured objective cognition in the presence of emotions at post- versus pretraining [\nSince prior intervention research in this field has mostly relied on self-report measures and there have been limited comprehensive attempts at examining the effects of longitudinal parent-child cointervention programs [\nA total of 24 parent-child dyads participated in this study. Dyads were recruited from the local community, that is, schools and university-affiliated pediatric clinics in the San Diego area through flyer advertisements and clinic referrals, respectively. The recruitment of parent-child dyads began on February 1, 2021, and ended on August 13, 2023. The study was registered on October 9, 2024, in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry (ISRCTN89594822).\nSigned informed consent was obtained from the parents, and signed assent was obtained from the children for study participation following the guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the University of California San Diego (protocol #180140). The study data were deidentified as per Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance. All the parent-child dyads were paid US $250 for completing all assessments and digital trainings.\nParent and child demographics including age, sex, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES) scores are shown in\nParental stress was measured using the 7 stress items on the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), anxiety was measured on the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and depression was measured on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire scale (PHQ-9).\nNot available.\nChild and parent baseline mental health scores are also shown in\nThis single-arm study was powered to detect a medium effect size (Cohen\nWe assessed intervention feasibility by monitoring the total number of assigned intervention sessions completed. Additionally, parents completed a feasibility survey at the end of the study that we have standardized in previous digital training studies [\nQuestions soliciting negative feedback are marked in italics format.\nEach parent-child dyad made 2 visits (baseline [preintervention] and 3 months later [postintervention]) to the Neural Engineering and Translational Labs and participated in behavioral and neurocognitive assessments (\nEach child self-reported on the CDI, and parents also provided CDI reports for their child. The CDI self-report and parent report are 12-item and 17-item scales, respectively, with higher scores reflecting greater child depression. Each CDI child report question requests the child to pick 1 of 3 sentences based on which one best described their emotion or behavior over the past 2 weeks rated 0=least to 2=most negative emotion or behavior. The CDI parent report enquires about child emotions or behaviors on a 4-point scale with anchors 0=not at all to 3=much or most of the time. Each parent additionally completed standard surveys assessing their own mental health including stress, anxiety, and depression, evaluated using the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) with 4-point anchors from 0=did not apply to me at all to 3=applied to me very much or most of the time [\nParticipants accessed a game-like emotion bias assessment adapted from studies of attentional bias in emotional contexts [\nWe assessed EEG neurophysiology on an attention-to-breathing task assessment that we have recently shown to relate to mindfulness in a large cross-sectional study [\nThe median response time (RT) on the breath monitoring task was monitored for all participants, so that we could identify and contrast neurophysiological activity on high consistency breath monitoring trials (trials with RT ≤1 median absolute deviation of median RT) versus low consistency trials (trials with RT >1 median absolute deviation of median RT). The underlying premise of this analysis is that when participants are in a state of higher interoceptive attention, they will show more consistent awareness of their respiratory cycle (ie, responding more consistently after every 2 breath cycle), while states of lower interoceptive attention may be associated with inconsistent breath monitoring. Thus, by comparing brain activity on more versus less consistent trials within each participant, we can examine brain activity underlying performance variability on this interoceptive attention task while controlling for interindividual differences in baseline characteristics of respiration.\nEEG data were collected simultaneous to this assessment using a 24-channel cap with saline-soaked electrodes following the 10‐20 system and a wireless SMARTING amplifier. The signals were digitized with a sampling rate of 500 Hz and 24-bit resolution and stored as .xdf files.\nAkin to a similar intervention that we deployed in adults [\nSpecifically to practice breath-focused mindfulness, individuals were requested to close their eyes, pay attention to their breathing, and tap the mobile screen after a specific number of breaths from 1 breath up to 10 breaths at a time. Consistency of performance was monitored, as users tapped the mobile screen after instructed number of breaths while keeping their eyes closed; the screen was digitally split to simultaneously track both parent and child performance, that is, one-half of the screen kept track of child finger taps, while the other half kept track of parent taps. If both parent and child consistently monitored breathing for at least two-thirds of the duration at any given level, where level refers to the number of breaths monitored, then they would together progress to monitoring the next level or count of breaths. At every sixth session of training, compassion instructions were relayed by text and audio before the start of the breath-focused exercises so that users could discuss and keep these instructions in mind during their practice. Over 30 sessions, there were a total of five levels of standard compassion training instructions provided focusing on (1) settling the mind, (2) compassion for a loved one, (3) compassion for self, (4) loving kindness for self, and (5) embracing common humanity; these instructions followed guidance from the Compassion Cultivation Training program [\nBehavioral outcomes were analyzed using paired tests comparing pre- and posttraining assessments as well as pre- and follow-up assessments. Outliers >3 median absolute deviation from the median were removed, and all metrics were inspected using the Anderson-Darling normality test in MATLAB prior to statistical analyses. All measures, that is, CDI reports from children and parents and parental stress (per DASS-21), anxiety (GAD-7), and depression (PHQ-9) measures, were not normally distributed; hence, they were analyzed for pre- to posttraining changes using signed rank tests. Parent mindfulness data were normally distributed and hence, analyzed using 1-tailed\nCognitive outcomes corresponded to the pre- to postintervention difference in processing speed on the emotion bias task. These data were not normally distributed, and pre- to posttraining differences in processing speed across participants were analyzed using the signed rank test, with group as a factor analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.\nNeural data on the eyes-closed attention-to-breathing task were analyzed according to methodologies used in our recently published studies [\nOn average, families completed a mean of 27.58 (SD 4.82) of the total 30 assigned sessions, with 19 of 24 families completing more than 90% of the assigned sessions.\nAll parents also completed a feasibility survey (\nPre- versus postintervention change in CDI scores for children by self-report showed a nonsignificant effect in the expected direction (signed rank test\nNotably, these patterns of behavioral change were mostly sustained at the 3-month follow-up after training completion (\nCognition was assessed as processing speed on the emotion bias task.

We found the CoCo digital trainings to be feasible with 80% (n=19) of families completing >90% (n=22) of sessions, and all families reporting positive feedback on an exit survey. We evaluated the pilot efficacy of this intervention program using behavioral surveys assessing depression in children by both self and parental reports as well as parental self-reported stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Overall, children showed a statistical trend toward, that is, nonsignificant improvement in the expected direction in self-reported depression at posttraining, while the parent-reported child depression symptoms showed a similar effect at 3-month follow-up. The parents showed significant reductions in their stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms at postintervention with sustained effects at the 3-month follow-up. Furthermore, the posttraining reduction in parental stress was significantly correlated with improvement in dispositional mindfulness. We further measured pre- versus posttraining cognition in the presence of emotional faces and found that emotion bias processing speed was significantly improved in children, and a nonsignificant effect in the expected direction was observed in parents. Finally, on a neural assessment of breath-focused attention, we found a significant reduction in DMN activity at postintervention relative to preintervention that was especially robust in children.\nOur observation of training-related reduction in parental stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms resonates with previous meta-analyses of behavioral interventions showing positive mental health benefits in parents [\nThe neuroplasticity signal, specifically, reduction in DMN activity at postintervention relative to preintervention replicates our recent findings of digital mindfulness and compassion training–related neural changes observed in adults [\nMajor limitations of this pilot intervention study include a small sample size and no control intervention comparator. Given the small sample size, we can only be confident of the medium to large effect size results in this pilot study obtained for parental depression, cognitive processing speed on the emotion bias task in children, and DMN neuroplasticity analyzed across all participants. Another limitation of the study was the lack of inclusion of Black and multiracial parent-child dyads as well as families from low affluence socioeconomics. We also acknowledge that parent-reported CDI measures may have potential bias; hence, we considered both parent and self-reports on this measure. Additionally, the CoCo training included both mindfulness and compassion instructions to maximize benefit, and disentangling their respective contribution to the outcomes is not possible in this study. Future studies should certainly include an active digital training control (eg, a relaxation app) with a larger sample size and ensure that the sample is more representative of racial and SES diversity. Further, since the training program was designed to target compassion, a future trial should include a compassion outcome measure as well as a measure of caregiver-child relational interaction.\nOverall, this study examined a promising, accessible, and scalable digital program for cotraining parents and children on aspects of mindfulness and compassion. Our results showed significant medium effect size improvements particularly for parental depression and smaller effect size improvements for parental stress and anxiety, as well as a nonsignificant reduction in the expected direction in depressive symptoms in children. Notably, these outcomes in parents were sustained at follow-up. Additionally, children showed significant medium effect size improvement in emotion bias–related cognitive processing and large effect size reduction of DMN activity on the attention-to-breathing task as a neural indicator of less mind-wandering or greater focus at posttraining. Compared to prior interventions, this study is novel in its use of dyadic parent-child cotraining design as well as multimodal outcome measures that combine EEG, cognitive, and behavioral data. Prior studies conducted separately in children and parents have particularly found improvements in mindfulness and stress-related behavioral measures of medium effect size, and one study showed improvements in stress-related cortisol levels in parents [", "content_for_embedding": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates a 5% prevalence of depression in US children [\nParents play significant roles as either supportive influences, protective buffers, or potential sources of risk depending on the nature of their caregiving relationship with their children [\nTo address this intervention gap, we developed and implemented a digital parent-child cotraining program that focuses on imparting mindfulness and compassion skills to both parent and child.

Electrodes were placed on the forehead, chosen for its sensitivity to stress-induced sweat gland activity. The recorded signals were digitized and processed in real-time using an ESP32-S3 WROOM-1 (Espressif Systems) microcontroller, which managed data acquisition, signal processing, and wireless transmission.”\n\n“The survey items from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-State) were used to assess participants' emotional and anxiety responses during the experiment. The PANAS scale consists of 10 items measuring Positive Affectivity and Negative Affectivity, each rated on a 1-5 Likert scale, where higher scores indicate stronger affective states. The STAI-State consists of 20 items assessing state anxiety, measured on a 1-4 Likert scale, where responses indicate varying degrees of agreement with statements reflecting anxiety levels. Higher scores in negative affectivity and anxiety-related items indicate greater distress, while higher scores in positive affectivity items indicate greater emotional well-being.”\n\n\n“d.

Each trial lasted about 10-15 minutes and was divided into three phases: baseline, CPT (Cold Pressor Test), and recovery. The length of the trial and the data used for feature analysis is as detailed in Table 2c-d.”\n\n\n\n“Sixteen participants (N=16) between ages 26-31 took part in the study, and demographic information, including race and gender, was collected and is summarized in Table 2a-b. Data was taken from each subject only once.”\n\n\n“In this study, SHAP analysis was performed on combinations of five features, selected from the total feature set of 15 EDG and 33 EOG features, highlighting the significance of how certain biomarkers, used together, reveal more prominent interactions and effects on model predictions. This approach underscores that certain biomarkers, while potentially less impactful individually, can demonstrate substantial importance when analyzed as part of a group. By evaluating these interactions, we understand how combinations of features can provide insights into the model’s behavior that single-feature analyses might overlook.”\n“The quality of a set of features is determined by considering their collective contribution to the model’s predictions, measured through the mean absolute SHAP values across the dataset. A high-quality set of features is one where the combination of features demonstrates substantial importance, as indicated by a higher mean absolute SHAP values. This benchmark reflects not only the magnitude of individual contributions but also the degree to which the features, as a group, interact to enhance the predictive power of the model.”\n\n\n“Figure 3 User-reported survey responses during each stage of the trial, displaying both box-and-whisker plots and column graphs for Positive Affectivity, Negative Affectivity, and State Anxiety (S-Anxiety) across the Baseline, CPT, and Recovery stages.”\n\n\n\n\n“The Cold Pressor Test (CPT) was conducted in a controlled lab environment, which may not fully reflect real-world anxiety triggers. Additionally, motion artifacts in EOG recordings, despite filtering efforts, could impact signal clarity. EDA signals were recorded using a single forehead electrode, though different placements (e.g., fingertips) may improve accuracy. Improved artifact detection and additional motion-tracking sensors could enhance data quality. Feature selection for SHAP analysis focused on optimizing interpretability, but alternative selections may yield different insights. Models and analyses constructed using this dataset may not generalize well to other stress-inducing scenarios. External validation using independent datasets is necessary to confirm these findings.”\n\n“Figure 2 This figure presents a visual representation of the experiment timeline, detailing the Baseline, Cold Pressor Test (CPT), and Recovery phases. The raw Electrooculography (EOG) and Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals across these phases show no immediately clear trend distinguishing the baseline and recovery from the CPT stressor. However, when specific features such as Blink Duration from EOG and Hjorth Activity from EDA are extracted and overlaid, more distinct patterns emerge, and can be used to quantify physiological responses to stress induction and subsequent recovery.”\n\n“Electrodermal activity (EDA) is a common measure of physiological arousal, but its reliability in depression research remains debated. Some studies report reduced EDA responses in individuals with major depressive disorder, suggesting impaired autonomic reactivity12 and emotional hypo-responsiveness13. However, conflicting findings point to variability due to factors like medication use and methodological differences14, emphasizing the need for further research on the relationship between physiological signals and emotional states.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "topic": "Social_neurology"}

These alterations favor the development of chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, which pose major clinical challenges and have a significant global economic impact [\nWound healing is a complex and dynamic process involving multiple cell types and biochemical pathways, from injury to complete regeneration. Under normal conditions, minor acute wounds heal within days to weeks without medical intervention. However, chronic wounds arise due to disruptions in the normal healing process, which is divided into three overlapping phases: hemostasis/inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling [\nTraditional ulcer treatments, including activated charcoal and debridement, are often costly and ineffective. Consequently, there is a growing need for innovative approaches that leverage new materials or modifications of conventional ones to improve cost-effectiveness and therapeutic outcomes [\nIn this context, bioactive polymers have gained attention for their potential in wound healing. For instance, natural latex derived from the rubber tree\nNatural compounds are widely used in wound healing due to their phytochemical constituents, which can act in tissue regeneration due to anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties [\nSimilarly, papain, a proteolytic enzyme extracted from papaya latex, contains essential nutrients and bioactive compounds, such as antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Papain exhibits anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties, contributing to its wound healing effects. Its enzymatic debridement activity and role in collagen synthesis (via vitamin C-mediated conversion of proline to hydroxyproline) make it particularly valuable for tissue repair [\nRecent advancements in nanotechnology have also revolutionized wound treatment. This field offers innovative solutions, including the use of advanced nanomaterials as dermal substitutes or drug delivery systems for bioactive molecules, thereby enhancing the healing process [\nPhotobiomodulation is a non-invasive technique that employs light at specific wavelengths, such as red or near-infrared, to stimulate biological responses in tissues. This type of irradiation can enhance ATP production, modulate oxidative stress, induce the release of growth factors, and stimulate cell proliferation [\nA therapeutic system called Rapha\nThe liposomal formulations presented a characteristic multilamellar profile. The dual-loaded liposomes (containing both curcumin and papain) exhibited an average vesicle size of 905.5 ± 122.3 nm, a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.764, and a zeta potential of −40.7 ± 2.22 mV. These values reflect the typical physicochemical characteristics of the multilamellar liposomes used in the study. Due to limitations in sample availability and instrument access during the experimental phase, individual characterization of the curcumin-only and papain-only liposomes was not performed. Therefore, comparative data among all liposome types were not generated.\nMicroscopic analyses confirmed the structural integrity and morphology of the vesicles. As shown in\nWe identified bands in the FTIR spectra of curcumin that displayed characteristic bands associated with its chemical structure, including a broad region from 3300 cm\nThe results of FTIR analyses of NLBs containing liposomes demonstrate that the characteristic functional groups of each sample were observed. No additional absorption bands, other than those already present in natural latex, curcumin, and papain, were identified.\nNLBs were produced by mixing liquid latex (DU LATEX Indústria Química Ltd., São Paulo, Brazil) with ultrapure water in a 1:1 volume ratio. The resulting solution was poured into plastic Petri dishes measuring 90 × 15 mm (\nWe observed loss of body weight in all diabetic groups (\nDuring the experiment, the animals exhibited clinical signs of diabetes, including weight loss, as illustrated in\nThe induction of diabetes resulted in elevated blood glucose levels, increased plasma fructosamine concentrations, and the presence of glycosuria. In this study, we noted that alloxan monohydrate increased plasma fructosamine levels in the rats (\nCompared to the control group, the treated groups demonstrated a significantly faster wound healing process in rats (\nThe use of NLB enriched with curcumin and papain liposomes, combined with LED phototherapy, significantly affected healing in diabetic rats. The results revealed that the groups treated with these biomembranes could show a significant contraction of the lesion surface, with the curcumin-treated group achieving an average contraction of 99% (\nAnother finding that helped to elucidate the process was the marked reduction in plasma levels of fructosamine in the treated groups, showing more effective glycemic control during healing. This finding validates the hypothesis that latex biomembranes with liposomes can exert a local therapeutic effect on the wound and systemically contribute to the metabolic balance of diabetic animals. This dual effect, on skin healing and blood glucose control, demonstrates the potential of these biomembranes as a promising, multifunctional approach to treating chronic wounds in diabetic patients.\nThis study investigated the therapeutic potential of a natural latex biomembrane (NLB) incorporated with liposomes loaded with curcumin and/or papain, combined with red LED photobiomodulation. Our findings represent a relevant advance in the field of wound care, demonstrating that this multifunctional dressing enhances tissue repair in a diabetic model through a synergistic action of bioactive compounds and light therapy.\nThe combination of curcumin and papain in the NLB improved wound contraction, with values of 99% and 95%, respectively, compared to NLB and LED alone. The therapeutic enhancement observed suggests that bioactive agents and LED act synergistically to stimulate tissue regeneration mechanisms, corroborating previous studies [\nThe FTIR spectra obtained for the NLBs showed characteristic bands matching those reported in the literature, confirming the successful incorporation of curcumin and papain into the NLB matrix. For instance, our findings align with those reported by Gemeinder et al. [\nLiposomes were selected as delivery systems due to their well-known biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic agents. These features have significantly enhanced the versatility of NLBs in drug delivery systems since they can deliver their cargo to the NLBs through protein associations [\nWhile positively charged nanoparticles generally exhibit greater cellular permeability [\nZhai and co-workers (2024) demonstrated that hydrogels can be functionalized with zinc oxide nanoparticles, enhanced collagen deposition and reduced inflammation and oxidative stress in diabetic wounds [\nClinically, our group has previously reported that curcumin-loaded NLBs promoted an average ulcer shrinkage rate of 89.9% in a pilot study involving diabetic patients [\nCurcumin’s therapeutic efficacy is well documented for wound treatment, especially due to its anti-inflammatory properties, including the inactivation of reactive oxygen species and the reduction in lipid peroxidation. Additionally, this natural compound may enhance cell proliferation, stimulate collagen synthesis and maturation, and promote extracellular matrix biosynthesis [\nFurthermore, Sidhu et al. highlighted the efficacy of curcumin treatments, whether applied topically or orally, in promoting wound healing in diabetic rats and genetically diabetic mice [\nThe efficacy of liposomal curcumin has been corroborated by studies using hydrogel platforms for diabetic wound healing. Liu and co-workers (2018) demonstrated improved wound closure, flexibility, and antimicrobial protection with curcumin-loaded gelatin microsphere hydrogels [\nIn this study, we used liposomes to encapsulate curcumin within the NLB matrix. This strategy effectively addresses the inherent limitations of curcumin, such as poor solubility and low bioavailability, while enabling its therapeutic application [\nLikewise, several studies have reported the successful development of liposomal and other lipid-based nanocarrier systems for curcumin, showing improvements in physicochemical stability, bioavailability, and therapeutic efficacy in wound healing. Liu et al. [\nMoreover, curcumin-based nanoformulations have demonstrated significant benefits in treating infected burns and promoting wound healing, as they enhance curcumin’s bioavailability and enable sustained drug release [\nLED phototherapy is supported by evidence demonstrating its role in reducing inflammation, stimulating fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis, enhancing granulation tissue formation, and increasing collagen synthesis [\nThe therapeutic synergy observed in this study likely arises from the complementary mechanisms of curcumin, papain, and red LED photobiomodulation. Curcumin exerts potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by downregulating NF-κB, COX-2, and other inflammatory mediators, as well as by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulating extracellular matrix production [\nThe present study did not include control groups comprising NLBs incorporated with curcumin-loaded liposomes, papain-loaded liposomes, or their combination in the absence of LED photobiomodulation. This experimental decision was based on the primary objective of evaluating the therapeutic potential of a combined strategy, integrating bioactive liposomal formulations with red light irradiation. The wound healing efficacy of curcumin and papain has been extensively documented in the literature, with curcumin demonstrating anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and proliferative effects [\nInterestingly, the reduction in fructosamine levels in treated animals suggests additional metabolic benefits. Curcumin and papain have demonstrated anti-glycation and antioxidant properties that may contribute to local wound microenvironment modulation and indirectly influence systemic metabolic markers [\nOverall, this study presents a promising strategy that integrates natural biomaterials, nanotechnology, and photobiostimulation to improve wound care. The multifunctional NLB platform incorporating liposomal curcumin and papain, combined with LED therapy, demonstrated superior healing in a diabetic model and reinforces its potential for translational applications.\nWhile the alloxan-induced diabetic rat model provides a well-established platform for investigating impaired wound healing, it does not fully replicate the complexity of chronic wounds in human diabetic patients, particularly concerning microbial biofilms, comorbidities, and persistent inflammation. Nevertheless, in vivo testing remains essential in preclinical research to evaluate safety and therapeutic potential before clinical application. Although our model enabled controlled assessment of treatment efficacy, future studies should explore more clinically relevant systems, such as organ-on-a-chip platforms and computational models, which better simulate dynamic physiological conditions and improve translational predictability.\nImportantly, the natural latex-based wound dressing used in this study has previously demonstrated safety and efficacy in human subjects [\nSeveral methodological limitations must be acknowledged. Although Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed compound incorporation, additional structural (SEM) and thermal (DSC) analyses were not conducted. The liposomes exhibited high polydispersity index (PDI) values, suggesting heterogeneous particle size distributions; however, this did not impair their therapeutic performance. Likewise, despite a negative surface charge, the liposomes effectively delivered curcumin and papain, possibly due to a sustained release profile. These parameters should be further optimized and standardized to improve reproducibility.\nAnother relevant limitation relates to the physicochemical characterization of liposomal formulations. While particle size, PDI, and zeta potential were evaluated for the dual-loaded liposomes containing curcumin and papain, a complete comparative analysis of the individual formulations—empty, curcumin-loaded, and papain-loaded liposomes—was not performed. Although all formulations were prepared and incorporated into the biomembranes, assessing the specific impact of single-agent encapsulation on colloidal behavior was beyond the scope of this study. As drug loading can influence vesicle size, surface charge, and stability, future studies should conduct comprehensive physicochemical and morphological characterization of each formulation to enhance mechanistic insight and support formulation refinement.\nThe absence of stability data for the liposomal formulations under various storage conditions is also a limitation. Although the main goal was to assess the wound healing efficacy of the liposome-loaded NLBs, the long-term stability of the formulations remains to be established. According to ICH Q1A(R2) guidelines, stability studies are essential for determining shelf-life, defining storage conditions, and ensuring the robustness and reproducibility of pharmaceutical products. Future work should include both real-time and accelerated stability testing to support the regulatory advancement of this therapeutic platform.\nAdditionally, the LED parameters used in this study were based on device specifications and standard preclinical guidelines. However, in vivo measurements of light penetration and absorption were not conducted. Since variables such as skin pigmentation, vascularization, and anatomical location may influence light distribution, these factors should be investigated in future studies to ensure consistency across diverse clinical scenarios.\nRegarding safety, no adverse effects were observed in animals treated with papain-loaded dressings. Nevertheless, papain is a proteolytic enzyme that may cause hypersensitivity reactions, particularly with occupational exposure or ingestion. While our formulation involves topical application within a natural latex matrix, the possibility of systemic absorption through compromised skin cannot be excluded. Thus, future studies should include toxicological and immunological assessments to evaluate sensitization potential, systemic exposure, and bioavailability. Establishing the immunological safety of repeated topical use will be critical for regulatory approval and clinical adoption.\nRegulatory translation of latex-based biomaterials also requires compliance with safety standards, long-term biocompatibility studies, and the development of scalable, standardized manufacturing protocols that preserve bioactivity. Dose–response analyses, multicenter clinical trials, and cost-effectiveness studies will be essential for integration into healthcare systems.\nFinally, the absence of specific control groups—such as NLBs containing bioactive liposomes without LED—limits the ability to distinguish additive from synergistic effects among the therapeutic components. This limitation has been addressed in the Discussion and considered in the interpretation of the results. Future studies should include additional comparative groups to clarify the individual and combined contributions of curcumin, papain, and phototherapy. Such efforts will be key to validating and optimizing this multimodal strategy for clinical translation.\nCollaborative efforts across dermatology, endocrinology, materials science, and surgical specialties will also be fundamental to confirm therapeutic efficacy and define appropriate clinical indications. While our results support a promising integrative approach involving biomaterials, nanotechnology, and photobiomodulation, a multidisciplinary translational strategy will be essential to ensure safe, effective, and patient-centered application in clinical settings.\nMultilamellar liposomes were obtained using the solvent evaporation and thin-film lipid hydration method, as described by Mohammed et al. [\nAfter complete solubilization of the lipids, a dry lipid film was formed by evaporation of the solvents using a rotary evaporator (Rotavapor\nThese liposomes are presented in\nAfter preparation, the multilamellar liposomes were initially evaluated for phase separation, curcumin (CUR) or papain (PAP) precipitation, and creaming formation under centrifugation at 1500 g (kasvi centrifuge K14-4000PRF) for 10 min at 10 °C. The mean hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential were measured with a ZetaSizer\nLiposomal suspensions containing curcumin (5 mg/mL) and papain (2.5 mg/mL) were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with a natural latex solution. Ten milliliters of this mixture was poured into sterile polystyrene plates measuring 90 × 15 mm (13.5 cm\nThe preparation of NLBs containing liposomes was carried out by adding curcumin- or papain-loaded liposomes to the latex solution at a ratio of 1:1. Ten milliliters (10 mL) of this mixture was placed in polypropylene Petri dishes and maintained in an oven at 40 °C for 24 h to produce the liposome-containing biomembranes.\nThe prepared NLBs were sterilized by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in a unidirectional laminar flow hood (CFLV 12-Veco, Veco Scientific Equipment, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil) for 30 min on each side, totaling 60 min. After sterilization, each biomembrane was individually wrapped in 90 mm × 160 mm self-sealing surgical paper and stored until use.\nThe chemical composition and potential molecular interactions among the latex biomembranes, liposomes, and bioactive compounds (curcumin and papain) were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy using a PRESTIGE 21 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Samples were analyzed in the form of potassium bromide (KBr, Shimadzu) pellets, prepared by mixing approximately 30 mg of KBr with 5% (\nControl spectra of pure curcumin, pure papain, natural latex biomembrane without liposomes, and empty liposomes were recorded for comparative analysis and baseline correction. The pellets were pressed at 80.0 kN 27 for three minutes. For each measurement, 45 scans were recorded with a resolution of 4.0 cm\nA total of 45 male Wistar rats, weighing between 240 and 320 g, were used in this study. The research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation at the University of Brasília (UnB) (under Protocol number 77/2018). The animals were provided by the Catholic University of Brasilia and housed in the vivarium of the Faculty of Health at UnB. The rats were randomly assigned to specific cages (five animals per cage) and provided with water, ad libitum feed and additional feed, such as granola and pumpkin seeds. They were maintained under standard laboratory conditions, with a 12 h light/dark cycle and a constant temperature of 23 °C throughout the study.\nThe animals were fasted for 12 h and then anesthetized intraperitoneally with a solution of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) (Syntec), adjusted to the weight of each animal. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of an alloxan monohydrate solution (120 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) [\nThe alloxan solution was prepared by dilution in 0.9% saline solution at a concentration of 60 mg/mL. Due to the photosensitive properties of the compound, the preparation was performed in a dark environment, with the bottle refrigerated and kept away from light until use. Six hours after diabetes induction, a 10% glucose solution was added to the animals’ water bottles and maintained for 24 h to prevent seizures and death due to the hypoglycemic phase.\nTen days after the chemical induction, the animals were subjected to an eight-hour fast, and blood glucose levels were measured. Animals with blood glucose levels ≥ 200 mg/dL were considered diabetic. For blood glucose measurement, the animals were restrained, and their tails were massaged to promote vasodilation of the caudal vein, facilitating blood sampling. A drop of blood was then placed directly onto a glucose test strip. The sampling area was aseptically cleaned with 70% alcohol, and blood was collected using an insulin cannula (13 × 0.45 mm, 26 G). Animals that did not achieve blood glucose levels ≥ 200 mg/dL were subjected to the induction protocol again.\nThe diabetic animals were weighed, and their blood glucose levels were measured on days 5, 9, and 13. For the treatment, rats with blood glucose levels exceeding 200 mg/dL had their dorsal hair shaved using a hair clipper (Philips model HC3410/15, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The animals were then placed in the supine position, and after aseptic preparation, a surgical wound was created using three forceps and a sterile 6 mm punch.\nThe experiment was conducted with 20 animals, as described in\nLED phototherapy was performed using a red light source (Rapha device) with a central wavelength of 650 ± 20 nm, chosen for its biostimulatory effects on tissue regeneration. In each session, the device was positioned at a fixed distance of approximately 2 cm above the dorsal wound, with the light beam oriented perpendicularly to the skin surface, covering an irradiated area of 2 cm\nThis specific wavelength was selected based on prior evidence demonstrating its efficacy in promoting key regenerative processes, such as fibroblast activation, angiogenesis, and collagen synthesis, as well as its favorable tissue penetration profile. Moreover, red light at 650 nm aligns with the absorption peaks of cytochrome c oxidase, a mitochondrial enzyme crucial to photobiomodulation. The selection was also supported by previous clinical studies conducted by our group, in which this wavelength demonstrated a therapeutic benefit when used with natural latex-based biomaterials for treating chronic wounds [\nThe power density (irradiance) was measured using an optical power meter (PM100D; Thorlabs Inc., Newton, New Jersey, USA) positioned at the same distance used in the animal model, yielding a value of 60 mW/cm\nSubstituting the values,\nThus, each 10 min session delivered a fluence of 36 J/cm\nThe animals were monitored for weight loss, water intake, diuresis, and fasting blood glucose levels every two treatment days throughout the experiment. Body weight and blood glucose levels were measured on treatment days, i.e., every 48 h. For this purpose, the animals were placed in a fiber box and weighed using a digital scale (Filizola, São Paulo, Brazil).\nAt the end of the experimental period, the animals were anesthetized and placed in the supine position. Asepsis was performed in the region where the intracardiac blood puncture was conducted. The collected blood samples were sent to the Veterinary Diagnostic Center in Granja do Torto, Brasília-DF, for biochemical analysis of fructosamine, a marker of average glucose concentration.\nThe percentage area of the wound after the postoperative period (induced by the punch injury) was calculated by comparing the changes in the wound size relative to the first day of surgery. Wound healing progression was assessed using ImageJ software (v.1.45) based on images captured during the experiment. The animals were photographed with an iPhone 6s (16 MP camera, Apple Inc., Cupertino, California, USA), and the images were processed with ImageJ software (v.1.45). The percentage of wound contraction was calculated by considering the initial size as 100%, using the following formula [\nA\nA\nAll animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the guidelines for the care and use of animals approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the UnB. All experimental procedures adhered to the Committee’s regulations. In this study, Wistar rats were used as a model for skin wound healing. The rats were maintained under unrestricted access to standard rodent food and water. Surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia induced by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine–xylazine solution, under fully aseptic conditions. Postoperative pain was managed by subcutaneous administration of ketoprofen (5 mg/kg). Efforts were made to minimize pain and discomfort in the animals throughout the study.\nThe results of in vivo experiments were analyzed by GraphPad Prisma\nThis study demonstrates that LED phototherapy, particularly in the red wavelength range (625–740 nm), significantly enhances the wound healing process when applied in conjunction with natural latex biomembranes (NLBs). The integration of bioactive compounds—curcumin and papain—into the NLB platform, combined with photobiostimulation, resulted in superior wound contraction compared to controls, indicating a synergistic therapeutic interaction between the components.\nThese findings build upon previous clinical applications of latex-based dressings by adding novel nanocarrier-based functionality. This innovative, cost-effective strategy offers a promising alternative for advancing wound care and improving patient outcomes in both preclinical and clinical contexts.\nCarneiro, M. L.

Liu and co-workers (2018) demonstrated improved wound closure, flexibility, and antimicrobial protection with curcumin-loaded gelatin microsphere hydrogels [\nIn this study, we used liposomes to encapsulate curcumin within the NLB matrix. This strategy effectively addresses the inherent limitations of curcumin, such as poor solubility and low bioavailability, while enabling its therapeutic application [\nLikewise, several studies have reported the successful development of liposomal and other lipid-based nanocarrier systems for curcumin, showing improvements in physicochemical stability, bioavailability, and therapeutic efficacy in wound healing. Liu et al. [\nMoreover, curcumin-based nanoformulations have demonstrated significant benefits in treating infected burns and promoting wound healing, as they enhance curcumin’s bioavailability and enable sustained drug release [\nLED phototherapy is supported by evidence demonstrating its role in reducing inflammation, stimulating fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis, enhancing granulation tissue formation, and increasing collagen synthesis [\nThe therapeutic synergy observed in this study likely arises from the complementary mechanisms of curcumin, papain, and red LED photobiomodulation. Curcumin exerts potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by downregulating NF-κB, COX-2, and other inflammatory mediators, as well as by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulating extracellular matrix production [\nThe present study did not include control groups comprising NLBs incorporated with curcumin-loaded liposomes, papain-loaded liposomes, or their combination in the absence of LED photobiomodulation. This experimental decision was based on the primary objective of evaluating the therapeutic potential of a combined strategy, integrating bioactive liposomal formulations with red light irradiation. The wound healing efficacy of curcumin and papain has been extensively documented in the literature, with curcumin demonstrating anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and proliferative effects [\nInterestingly, the reduction in fructosamine levels in treated animals suggests additional metabolic benefits. Curcumin and papain have demonstrated anti-glycation and antioxidant properties that may contribute to local wound microenvironment modulation and indirectly influence systemic metabolic markers [\nOverall, this study presents a promising strategy that integrates natural biomaterials, nanotechnology, and photobiostimulation to improve wound care. The multifunctional NLB platform incorporating liposomal curcumin and papain, combined with LED therapy, demonstrated superior healing in a diabetic model and reinforces its potential for translational applications.\nWhile the alloxan-induced diabetic rat model provides a well-established platform for investigating impaired wound healing, it does not fully replicate the complexity of chronic wounds in human diabetic patients, particularly concerning microbial biofilms, comorbidities, and persistent inflammation. Nevertheless, in vivo testing remains essential in preclinical research to evaluate safety and therapeutic potential before clinical application. Although our model enabled controlled assessment of treatment efficacy, future studies should explore more clinically relevant systems, such as organ-on-a-chip platforms and computational models, which better simulate dynamic physiological conditions and improve translational predictability.\nImportantly, the natural latex-based wound dressing used in this study has previously demonstrated safety and efficacy in human subjects [\nSeveral methodological limitations must be acknowledged. Although Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed compound incorporation, additional structural (SEM) and thermal (DSC) analyses were not conducted. The liposomes exhibited high polydispersity index (PDI) values, suggesting heterogeneous particle size distributions; however, this did not impair their therapeutic performance. Likewise, despite a negative surface charge, the liposomes effectively delivered curcumin and papain, possibly due to a sustained release profile. These parameters should be further optimized and standardized to improve reproducibility.\nAnother relevant limitation relates to the physicochemical characterization of liposomal formulations. While particle size, PDI, and zeta potential were evaluated for the dual-loaded liposomes containing curcumin and papain, a complete comparative analysis of the individual formulations—empty, curcumin-loaded, and papain-loaded liposomes—was not performed. Although all formulations were prepared and incorporated into the biomembranes, assessing the specific impact of single-agent encapsulation on colloidal behavior was beyond the scope of this study. As drug loading can influence vesicle size, surface charge, and stability, future studies should conduct comprehensive physicochemical and morphological characterization of each formulation to enhance mechanistic insight and support formulation refinement.\nThe absence of stability data for the liposomal formulations under various storage conditions is also a limitation. Although the main goal was to assess the wound healing efficacy of the liposome-loaded NLBs, the long-term stability of the formulations remains to be established. According to ICH Q1A(R2) guidelines, stability studies are essential for determining shelf-life, defining storage conditions, and ensuring the robustness and reproducibility of pharmaceutical products. Future work should include both real-time and accelerated stability testing to support the regulatory advancement of this therapeutic platform.\nAdditionally, the LED parameters used in this study were based on device specifications and standard preclinical guidelines. However, in vivo measurements of light penetration and absorption were not conducted. Since variables such as skin pigmentation, vascularization, and anatomical location may influence light distribution, these factors should be investigated in future studies to ensure consistency across diverse clinical scenarios.\nRegarding safety, no adverse effects were observed in animals treated with papain-loaded dressings. Nevertheless, papain is a proteolytic enzyme that may cause hypersensitivity reactions, particularly with occupational exposure or ingestion. While our formulation involves topical application within a natural latex matrix, the possibility of systemic absorption through compromised skin cannot be excluded. Thus, future studies should include toxicological and immunological assessments to evaluate sensitization potential, systemic exposure, and bioavailability. Establishing the immunological safety of repeated topical use will be critical for regulatory approval and clinical adoption.\nRegulatory translation of latex-based biomaterials also requires compliance with safety standards, long-term biocompatibility studies, and the development of scalable, standardized manufacturing protocols that preserve bioactivity. Dose–response analyses, multicenter clinical trials, and cost-effectiveness studies will be essential for integration into healthcare systems.\nFinally, the absence of specific control groups—such as NLBs containing bioactive liposomes without LED—limits the ability to distinguish additive from synergistic effects among the therapeutic components. This limitation has been addressed in the Discussion and considered in the interpretation of the results. Future studies should include additional comparative groups to clarify the individual and combined contributions of curcumin, papain, and phototherapy. Such efforts will be key to validating and optimizing this multimodal strategy for clinical translation.\nCollaborative efforts across dermatology, endocrinology, materials science, and surgical specialties will also be fundamental to confirm therapeutic efficacy and define appropriate clinical indications. While our results support a promising integrative approach involving biomaterials, nanotechnology, and photobiomodulation, a multidisciplinary translational strategy will be essential to ensure safe, effective, and patient-centered application in clinical settings.\nMultilamellar liposomes were obtained using the solvent evaporation and thin-film lipid hydration method, as described by Mohammed et al. [\nAfter complete solubilization of the lipids, a dry lipid film was formed by evaporation of the solvents using a rotary evaporator (Rotavapor\nThese liposomes are presented in\nAfter preparation, the multilamellar liposomes were initially evaluated for phase separation, curcumin (CUR) or papain (PAP) precipitation, and creaming formation under centrifugation at 1500 g (kasvi centrifuge K14-4000PRF) for 10 min at 10 °C. The mean hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential were measured with a ZetaSizer\nLiposomal suspensions containing curcumin (5 mg/mL) and papain (2.5 mg/mL) were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with a natural latex solution. Ten milliliters of this mixture was poured into sterile polystyrene plates measuring 90 × 15 mm (13.5 cm\nThe preparation of NLBs containing liposomes was carried out by adding curcumin- or papain-loaded liposomes to the latex solution at a ratio of 1:1. Ten milliliters (10 mL) of this mixture was placed in polypropylene Petri dishes and maintained in an oven at 40 °C for 24 h to produce the liposome-containing biomembranes.\nThe prepared NLBs were sterilized by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in a unidirectional laminar flow hood (CFLV 12-Veco, Veco Scientific Equipment, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil) for 30 min on each side, totaling 60 min. After sterilization, each biomembrane was individually wrapped in 90 mm × 160 mm self-sealing surgical paper and stored until use.\nThe chemical composition and potential molecular interactions among the latex biomembranes, liposomes, and bioactive compounds (curcumin and papain) were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy using a PRESTIGE 21 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Samples were analyzed in the form of potassium bromide (KBr, Shimadzu) pellets, prepared by mixing approximately 30 mg of KBr with 5% (\nControl spectra of pure curcumin, pure papain, natural latex biomembrane without liposomes, and empty liposomes were recorded for comparative analysis and baseline correction. The pellets were pressed at 80.0 kN 27 for three minutes. For each measurement, 45 scans were recorded with a resolution of 4.0 cm\nA total of 45 male Wistar rats, weighing between 240 and 320 g, were used in this study. The research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation at the University of Brasília (UnB) (under Protocol number 77/2018). The animals were provided by the Catholic University of Brasilia and housed in the vivarium of the Faculty of Health at UnB. The rats were randomly assigned to specific cages (five animals per cage) and provided with water, ad libitum feed and additional feed, such as granola and pumpkin seeds. They were maintained under standard laboratory conditions, with a 12 h light/dark cycle and a constant temperature of 23 °C throughout the study.\nThe animals were fasted for 12 h and then anesthetized intraperitoneally with a solution of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) (Syntec), adjusted to the weight of each animal. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of an alloxan monohydrate solution (120 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) [\nThe alloxan solution was prepared by dilution in 0.9% saline solution at a concentration of 60 mg/mL. Due to the photosensitive properties of the compound, the preparation was performed in a dark environment, with the bottle refrigerated and kept away from light until use. Six hours after diabetes induction, a 10% glucose solution was added to the animals’ water bottles and maintained for 24 h to prevent seizures and death due to the hypoglycemic phase.\nTen days after the chemical induction, the animals were subjected to an eight-hour fast, and blood glucose levels were measured. Animals with blood glucose levels ≥ 200 mg/dL were considered diabetic. For blood glucose measurement, the animals were restrained, and their tails were massaged to promote vasodilation of the caudal vein, facilitating blood sampling. A drop of blood was then placed directly onto a glucose test strip. The sampling area was aseptically cleaned with 70% alcohol, and blood was collected using an insulin cannula (13 × 0.45 mm, 26 G). Animals that did not achieve blood glucose levels ≥ 200 mg/dL were subjected to the induction protocol again.\nThe diabetic animals were weighed, and their blood glucose levels were measured on days 5, 9, and 13. For the treatment, rats with blood glucose levels exceeding 200 mg/dL had their dorsal hair shaved using a hair clipper (Philips model HC3410/15, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The animals were then placed in the supine position, and after aseptic preparation, a surgical wound was created using three forceps and a sterile 6 mm punch.\nThe experiment was conducted with 20 animals, as described in\nLED phototherapy was performed using a red light source (Rapha device) with a central wavelength of 650 ± 20 nm, chosen for its biostimulatory effects on tissue regeneration. In each session, the device was positioned at a fixed distance of approximately 2 cm above the dorsal wound, with the light beam oriented perpendicularly to the skin surface, covering an irradiated area of 2 cm\nThis specific wavelength was selected based on prior evidence demonstrating its efficacy in promoting key regenerative processes, such as fibroblast activation, angiogenesis, and collagen synthesis, as well as its favorable tissue penetration profile. Moreover, red light at 650 nm aligns with the absorption peaks of cytochrome c oxidase, a mitochondrial enzyme crucial to photobiomodulation. The selection was also supported by previous clinical studies conducted by our group, in which this wavelength demonstrated a therapeutic benefit when used with natural latex-based biomaterials for treating chronic wounds [\nThe power density (irradiance) was measured using an optical power meter (PM100D; Thorlabs Inc., Newton, New Jersey, USA) positioned at the same distance used in the animal model, yielding a value of 60 mW/cm\nSubstituting the values,\nThus, each 10 min session delivered a fluence of 36 J/cm\nThe animals were monitored for weight loss, water intake, diuresis, and fasting blood glucose levels every two treatment days throughout the experiment. Body weight and blood glucose levels were measured on treatment days, i.e., every 48 h. For this purpose, the animals were placed in a fiber box and weighed using a digital scale (Filizola, São Paulo, Brazil).\nAt the end of the experimental period, the animals were anesthetized and placed in the supine position. Asepsis was performed in the region where the intracardiac blood puncture was conducted. The collected blood samples were sent to the Veterinary Diagnostic Center in Granja do Torto, Brasília-DF, for biochemical analysis of fructosamine, a marker of average glucose concentration.\nThe percentage area of the wound after the postoperative period (induced by the punch injury) was calculated by comparing the changes in the wound size relative to the first day of surgery. Wound healing progression was assessed using ImageJ software (v.1.45) based on images captured during the experiment. The animals were photographed with an iPhone 6s (16 MP camera, Apple Inc., Cupertino, California, USA), and the images were processed with ImageJ software (v.1.45). The percentage of wound contraction was calculated by considering the initial size as 100%, using the following formula [\nA\nA\nAll animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the guidelines for the care and use of animals approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the UnB. All experimental procedures adhered to the Committee’s regulations. In this study, Wistar rats were used as a model for skin wound healing. The rats were maintained under unrestricted access to standard rodent food and water. Surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia induced by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine–xylazine solution, under fully aseptic conditions. Postoperative pain was managed by subcutaneous administration of ketoprofen (5 mg/kg). Efforts were made to minimize pain and discomfort in the animals throughout the study.\nThe results of in vivo experiments were analyzed by GraphPad Prisma\nThis study demonstrates that LED phototherapy, particularly in the red wavelength range (625–740 nm), significantly enhances the wound healing process when applied in conjunction with natural latex biomembranes (NLBs). The integration of bioactive compounds—curcumin and papain—into the NLB platform, combined with photobiostimulation, resulted in superior wound contraction compared to controls, indicating a synergistic therapeutic interaction between the components.\nThese findings build upon previous clinical applications of latex-based dressings by adding novel nanocarrier-based functionality. This innovative, cost-effective strategy offers a promising alternative for advancing wound care and improving patient outcomes in both preclinical and clinical contexts.\nCarneiro, M. L.

Although antidepressant treatment is one of the foremost therapies, ~20%-30% of patients do not respond favorably to it.\nNeuroimaging studies are advantageous for subtype analyses. They offer pathophysiological insights into treatment-resistance traits by providing objective neurobiological evidence. Among various neuroimaging modalities, electroencephalography (EEG) is a promising tool for investigating biomarkers to predict antidepressant responsiveness prior to treatment. Specifically, EEG directly captures complex neurophysiological activities with superior temporal resolution compared to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\nPrevious EEG-based studies have demonstrated that machine learning (ML)-based classifiers could predict antidepressant responsiveness.\nExpanding the number of biomarker candidates could be a breakthrough in the development of reliable predictive systems. Although most previous ML-based studies primarily utilized resting-state PSD-related features, recent suggestions indicate that a combination of diverse biomarkers could enhance the ML performance by capturing the heterogeneous characteristics of individual patients with MDD.\nNon-zero phase-lag gamma-band inter-regional synchronizations have recently been suggested to play a role in feed-forward communication.\nIn this study, we investigated whether pre-treatment FC dynamics in response to salient stimuli can predict antidepressant responsiveness. Specifically, gamma-band dFC was evaluated to capture transient information flow and then employed as a feature candidate to discriminate between non-remitted MDD (nrMDD) and remitted MDD (rMDD) under the MMN paradigm. The feasibility of dFC features was demonstrated using ML-based classification models. Further statistical analyses and pathophysiological interpretations were conducted to identify powerful features. We hypothesized that patients with nrMDD would exhibit aberrant salient information processing, which is associated with their pathophysiological characteristics.\nA total of 51 patients with drug-naïve MDD (aged 45.22 ± 12.20 years; Males: 3) were enrolled in the study from the Department of Psychiatry at the Inje University, Ilsan Paik Hospital.

Due to data quality issues, one participant was excluded from further analysis. As a result, the data from 21 HCs (aged 43.81 ± 14.10 years; Males: 3) were analyzed.\nThis study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All individuals provided written informed consent and fully understood the nature of the experiment prior to their participation. Ethical review and approval of this study were obtained from the Inje University, Ilsan Paik Hospital Institutional Review Board (Nos. 2016-08-017-007 and 2015-04-316-019).\nTo assess depressive and anxiety symptom severity, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) with 17 items\nAll participants engaged in a duration-variant auditory MMN paradigm. The probability of a deviant stimulus was set to 10% for 750 trials. The participants were asked to watch a silent movie (Charlie Chaplin silent film) during auditory stimulus presentation without focusing on the auditory stimuli. Auditory stimuli were presented binaurally using noise-canceling MDR-D777 headphones (Sony, Tokyo, Japan). The pitch and loudness of all stimuli were set to 1000 Hz and 85 dB, respectively. The interstimulus interval was fixed at 600 ms. The duration of the stimulation was set to 50 ms for the standard stimuli and 100 ms for the deviant stimuli, with the rising and falling edges set to 10 ms. The detailed information is accessible in our previous study.\nThe participants were asked to sit comfortably on a chair. Biosignals were acquired using Neuroscan SynAmps2 (Compumedics, El Paso, TX, USA). A total of 64 Ag-AgCl electrodes mounted on a QuikCap were placed according to the extended 10-20 system to record the EEG signals. To record the horizontal and vertical electrooculogram components, four additional electrodes were placed on the outer canthi above and below the left eye. An additional channel was attached below the clavicle to record the electrocardiogram signals. The impedance of all electrodes was maintained below 5 kΩ during the recording. Biosignals were recorded at a 1000-Hz sampling rate, before applying a bandpass filter with cutoff frequencies of 0.1 and 100 Hz. A 60-Hz notch filter was applied to reject power-line noise.\nThe acquired EEG signals were pre-processed using the EEGLAB toolbox\nTo construct functional brain networks, source-level signals were reconstructed using the Brainstorm toolbox.\nA total of 31 cortical regions were used as representative functional nodes. These regions of interest (ROIs) were determined based on previous resting-state fMRI studies.\nHilbert-transform-based weighted phase-lag indices (wPLIs; Supplementary Material)\nTo evaluate the temporal dynamics of FCs, a template was created using demography-matched HC data. Specifically, the “normative” template was acquired by grand-averaged time-dependent wPLIs of HCs. Pearson correlations were computed across time points (0-500 ms) between the template and each patient’s time-dependent wPLI trajectories for every pair of nodes. This approach was carefully designed to efficiently compress the feature space while capturing this pathophysiological characteristic, without relying on prior information about the dataset.\nPearson correlation coefficients were computed between the template and the corresponding time-dependent wPLIs for each patient for dFC evaluation. The correlation coefficients were then Fisher’s\nAn ML-based classification analysis was performed to demonstrate the potential of dFC features. Three types of classification models, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA),\nTo prevent bias due to sample imbalance, the misclassification cost was set as the inverse ratio of patients in each group (ie, 0.5745 and 0.4255 for nrMDD and rMDD, respectively). To assess the classification performance, classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated with respect to nrMDD. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was acquired for the outperforming classifier.\nIt was assumed that all data followed a normal distribution because all absolute values of skewness and kurtosis were less than two and seven, respectively.\nA simple effect analysis was employed for “core” dFC features, which were most frequently selected in the LOOCV step. The core dFCs between the nrMDD and rMDD groups were compared using a permutation test (\nThere were no significant demographic differences between the groups (\nDemographic and symptom severity comparison. While the demographic measures, including age, gender, and education were compared for three groups, the clinical measures were compared between nrMDD and rMDD groups.\nAbbreviations: nrMDD, non-remitted MDD; rMDD, remitted MDD; HC, healthy control; Ham-D, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; Ham-A, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; DSST, Digit-Symbol Substitution Test.\nIn the classification analysis, the best classification performance was achieved when the LDA classifier was employed with three features. Specifically, we achieved classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 82.98%, 95.00%, and 74.07%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for the ROC curve was 0.8315 (\nBest classification performance and core feature subset. (A) ROC curve with its classifier AUC.

Ham-D: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; lPMFG: left posterior middle frontal gyrus; rSup: right supramarginal gyrus; lV1: left primary visual cortex; lMTG: left middle temporal gyrus.\nIn this study, we investigated the potential of dFC in response to salient stimuli as an antidepressant responsiveness predictor in patients with MDD. It was demonstrated that the dFC features could effectively discriminate between nrMDD and rMDD. Specifically, HC template-based analyses indicated that patients with nrMDD were characterized by intact time-dependent FC patterns in the lPMFG–rSup but disrupted patterns in the rAng–rAMFG and lV1–lMTG. Among them, increased lV1–lMTG dFC and decreased lPMFG–rSup similarities were associated with the improvement in depressive symptoms.\nMethodologically, HC template-based Pearson correlation analyses were used to evaluate FC dynamics for each patient. Pearson’s correlation was employed to effectively capture the time-dependent characteristics. It is to be noted that Pearson’s correlation was employed to evaluate FC in fMRI studies based on this trait.\nAberrant gamma-band dFCs have been hypothesized to be linked to the NMDAR model. Recent molecular psychiatric studies have focused on excessive NMDAR activation in patients with MDD.\ndFC features, including rAng–rAMFG and lV1–lMTG, were disrupted in patients with nrMDD. The aberrant dynamics between rAng and rAMFG may stem from hyperconnectivity during the initial period (0-40 ms,\nContrary to the findings of other studies, the lPMFG–rSup dFC was altered in patients with rMDD but not in those with nrMDD. Although patients with intact FC patterns generally show antidepressant responsiveness, as mentioned previously, there are a few contradictory FCs.\nCorrelation between the dFC in the lPMFG–rSup and the pre-treatment DSST score. DSST: Digit-Symbol Substitution Test; lPMFG: left posterior middle frontal gyrus; rSup: right supramarginal gyrus.\nThese three core features were consistently selected throughout the validation set except for two samples that shared several characteristics. First, although these two samples were originally classified as rMDD, they were misclassified as such. Second, in the training set, the feature rank of lV1–lMTG was fourth, leading to the selection of an alternative dFC feature, whereas the other two dFC features were commonly selected. Intrigued by this anomaly, we performed an additional classification analysis for these two validation sets using the three core features. Remarkably, these two initially misclassified samples were correctly classified as rMDD. This outcome not only confirms the robustness of the three proposed core features but also highlights the validity of our classification model.\nUsing only dFC features, we achieved a promising classification performance. Although predicting antidepressant responsiveness using EEG features remains challenging,\nIn future studies, ML performance could be enhanced by identifying novel and robust biomarkers or determining the optimal biomarker combination. Among previous ML-based studies, Mumtaz et al.\nDespite its many advantages, this study had some limitations. First, the sample size was not sufficiently large enough to generalize our findings. Due to the limited sample size, we could not validate the proposed performance of the ML using an independent dataset. The small sample size of HC may limit the robustness and generalizability of the constructed normative template. To enhance robustness of our results, further replication studies with diverse cohorts are required. Second, we focused only on the 8-week treatment responsiveness. In future studies, consideration of other prognostic factors (eg, relapse) could broaden our understanding of its pathophysiology. Third, a placebo control group was not included in the present study. Fourth, there may have been confounding effects of comorbidities in our study. Furthermore, due to data imbalance, we adopted a classification approach for “remission” for each patient, rather than “responsiveness.” Fifth, inter-regional gamma-band FC should be carefully interpreted as gamma-band activities are not necessarily linked to direct functional communications\nIn this study, we propose that pre-treatment dynamic gamma-band FC responses to salient stimuli could serve as biomarkers for antidepressant responsiveness prediction in patients with MDD. Patients were successfully classified into nrMDD and rMDD groups using three pathophysiological dFC features: lPMFG–rSup, rAng–rAMFG, and lV1–lMTG. Notably, patients with nrMDD exhibit aberrant transient hyperconnections, which may be associated with NMDAR malfunctioning. We hope that the methodology and findings of this study expand the neurobiological understanding of MDD and contribute to neurodynamic biomarker identification.", "content_for_embedding": "Prediction of antidepressant responsiveness in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) remains a critical challenge. Although antidepressant treatment is one of the foremost therapies, ~20%-30% of patients do not respond favorably to it.\nNeuroimaging studies are advantageous for subtype analyses. They offer pathophysiological insights into treatment-resistance traits by providing objective neurobiological evidence. Among various neuroimaging modalities, electroencephalography (EEG) is a promising tool for investigating biomarkers to predict antidepressant responsiveness prior to treatment. Specifically, EEG directly captures complex neurophysiological activities with superior temporal resolution compared to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\nPrevious EEG-based studies have demonstrated that machine learning (ML)-based classifiers could predict antidepressant responsiveness.\nExpanding the number of biomarker candidates could be a breakthrough in the development of reliable predictive systems. Although most previous ML-based studies primarily utilized resting-state PSD-related features, recent suggestions indicate that a combination of diverse biomarkers could enhance the ML performance by capturing the heterogeneous characteristics of individual patients with MDD.\nNon-zero phase-lag gamma-band inter-regional synchronizations have recently been suggested to play a role in feed-forward communication.\nIn this study, we investigated whether pre-treatment FC dynamics in response to salient stimuli can predict antidepressant responsiveness. Specifically, gamma-band dFC was evaluated to capture transient information flow and then employed as a feature candidate to discriminate between non-remitted MDD (nrMDD) and remitted MDD (rMDD) under the MMN paradigm. The feasibility of dFC features was demonstrated using ML-based classification models. Further statistical analyses and pathophysiological interpretations were conducted to identify powerful features. We hypothesized that patients with nrMDD would exhibit aberrant salient information processing, which is associated with their pathophysiological characteristics.\nA total of 51 patients with drug-naïve MDD (aged 45.22 ± 12.20 years; Males: 3) were enrolled in the study from the Department of Psychiatry at the Inje University, Ilsan Paik Hospital.

This database includes comprehensive longitudinal data on demographics, diagnoses, medications, laboratory results, and healthcare utilization, enabling precise cohort identification and robust outcome analyses. All data are deidentified in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring patient privacy.\nThis study compared adults with T2DM who initiated either GLP-1 RAs or metformin as first-line therapy between November 20, 2004, and November 20, 2024. Patients were identified from a global federated health network encompassing 98 healthcare organizations. Eligibility criteria included a T2DM diagnosis (ICD-10-CM E11.x) and a prescription for GLP-1 RAs (ATC A10BJ) or metformin (ATC A10BA). The index date was defined as the earliest prescription date post-diagnosis, with a minimum of 24 months of follow-up to ensure rigorous outcome assessment and reduce potential bias. The 24-month follow-up period was selected to ensure sufficient time to observe dementia outcomes while accommodating real-world study constraints. This duration captures incident cases and reduces biases from short-term fluctuations or diagnostic misclassifications. It aligns with prior research showing significant cognitive outcomes often emerge within 2–5 years of intervention.\nPatients were stratified into two treatment cohorts based on their initial antidiabetic therapy: the GLP-1 RA cohort and the metformin cohort. Cross-over between the two drug classes was prohibited to maintain treatment consistency, although the use of additional glucose-lowering medications—such as sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and insulins—was allowed if initiated after the index date. This strategy ensures that differences in observed outcomes can be attributed to the primary treatment, thereby minimizing confounding.\nTo strengthen methodological rigor, patients who had been prescribed newer agents, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i; ATC A10BK) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i; ATC A10BH), were excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, only patients with continuous prescriptions for their assigned therapy over a minimum duration of 6 months were included in the study population. This inclusion criterion ensured sustained exposure during the early treatment phase, thereby reducing the likelihood of treatment misclassification and enhancing the reliability of outcome assessment.\nTo ensure analytical validity, patients were excluded if they had prior exposure to the alternate drug class, pre-existing dementia diagnoses (ICD-10-CM F01: vascular dementia (VaD), G30: Alzheimer’s disease, F03: unspecified dementia), significant cognitive or neurological impairments, psychiatric disorders (ICD-10-CM F32–F39: depressive and mood disorders), Parkinson’s disease (ICD-10-CM G20), cerebral atherosclerosis (ICD-10-CM I67.2), or alcohol-related cognitive disorders (ICD-10-CM F10.27). Additionally, individuals with end-stage renal disease (ICD-10-CM N18.6) or undergoing dialysis within 6 months before the index date were excluded. These exclusion criteria ensured a precise and comprehensive comparison of GLP-1 RAs and metformin in reducing dementia risk, thereby providing reliable insights for clinical and real-world applications.\nThe primary outcome was the incidence of overall dementia, defined as the first occurrence of a diagnosis of VaD, AD, unspecified dementia, or dementia associated with other diseases. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of specific dementia subtypes, such as VaD, AD, and other forms of dementia, as well as all-cause mortality.\nTo address potential biases from pre-existing or undiagnosed dementia and to allow sufficient time for the therapeutic effects of the medications to manifest, a 6-month washout period was applied. Outcomes occurring within this interval were excluded from the analysis. Follow-up began on day 181 after the index date and continued until the first occurrence of an outcome, loss to follow-up, or the conclusion of the study period.\nPatients with prior diagnoses of dementia or who experienced all-cause mortality before the washout period were excluded. Additionally, participants with less than 24 months of follow-up after the washout period were excluded to ensure an adequate observation period for capturing meaningful clinical outcomes.\nTo address potential confounding factors, we adjusted for an extensive set of baseline covariates. These included demographic variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity), clinical characteristics (eg, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease), and laboratory measurements such as hemoglobin A1c and body mass index (BMI). Concomitant medication use, including insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and statins, was also accounted for (\nPropensity score matching (PSM) with a 1:1 nearest-neighbor algorithm and a caliper width of 0.1 was used to balance these covariates between the GLP-1 receptor agonist and metformin cohorts. The success of matching was validated by ensuring standardized mean differences (SMDs) of less than 0.1 for all covariates.\nTime-to-event outcomes, including dementia, were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves to estimate cumulative incidence and log-rank tests to compare dementia incidence between cohorts. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate HRs with 95% CIs, addressing residual imbalances in covariates following PSM. Schoenfeld residuals validated the proportional hazards assumption, ensuring the robustness of the models. To account for potential time-dependent effects of treatment, time-varying covariates were incorporated, allowing for dynamic assessment of changes in patient profiles and treatment exposures during follow-up.\nFollow-up started on day 181 post-index, following a 6-month washout period designed to reduce reverse causation bias by excluding outcomes that might be influenced by pre-existing conditions or early treatment effects. Sensitivity analyses were performed using the pre-PSM population to validate the primary findings. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for all baseline covariates from\nSubgroup analyses examined potential effect modifications based on baseline characteristics such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, concurrent medication use (eg, insulin, sulfonylureas, statins), and glycemic control categories (eg, hemoglobin A1c levels). Statistical significance was determined using a two-sided p value threshold of <0.05. All analyses were performed on the TriNetX platform, which adheres to stringent quality control standards and is validated for real-world data analyses. To enhance generalizability, key findings were replicated across independent database subsets and stratified by healthcare settings and geographic regions.\nIn this analysis, we compared the baseline characteristics of patients with T2DM receiving GLP-1 RAs or metformin as first-line antidiabetic therapy before and after PSM. Before matching, significant imbalances were noted in age, sex distribution, and comorbidity prevalence, including higher proportions of male patients and greater comorbidity burden among those treated with metformin. Additionally, metabolic measures, such as BMI and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), reflected more pronounced obesity and glycemic dysregulation in the GLP-1 RA group.\nAfter PSM, the two cohorts demonstrated excellent balance across key covariates, with absolute standardized mean differences (ASMDs) consistently below 0.1. The matched cohorts achieved comparability in age (mean age ~58 years), sex distribution (~36% male), comorbidity profiles (eg, similar rates of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease), and metabolic parameters (eg, HbA1c and BMI categories). This matching minimized baseline differences, ensuring the validity of subsequent analyses comparing dementia incidence and other outcomes between these two treatment groups.\nAmong 87,229 matched patients in each cohort, GLP-1 RA use was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of overall dementia compared with metformin (2.4% vs 4.8%; AHR 0.90; 95% CI 0.85 to 0.95) (\nAHR, adjusted HR; GLP-1 RA, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist.\nIn terms of secondary outcomes, the all-cause mortality rate was notably reduced in the GLP-1 RA group (4.8% vs 8.8%; AHR 0.89; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95). These findings underscore the potential advantages of GLP-1 RAs in mitigating dementia and mortality risks among patients with T2DMs.\nAcross all dementia outcomes, GLP-1 RAs demonstrated significant reductions in risk compared with metformin, particularly in older adults, females, and White and Black patients. For overall dementia, the aHR was 0.87 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.91; p<0.0001), with consistent findings across subgroups. The benefits were most pronounced in patients aged ≥60 years, with significant reductions noted in those aged 60–79 years (aHR 0.85; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.90) and ≥80 years (aHR 0.80; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.88). Both sexes benefited, although females had a slightly lower aHR (0.83; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.89) compared with males (0.90; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97).\nFor AD, GLP-1 RAs reduced risk by 12% overall (aHR 0.88; 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94). Older age groups, particularly those ≥60 years, experienced the strongest benefits, with females showing a more substantial reduction (aHR 0.82; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89). Racial subgroup analysis revealed significant reductions among White patients (aHR 0.85; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.92), while other racial groups showed limited effects.\nVaD risk showed no significant difference in the overall population (aHR 1.00; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.08), although females had a modest risk reduction (aHR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99). No consistent trends were observed across age or racial subgroups.\nFor other dementia subtypes, GLP-1 RAs provided a robust protective effect (aHR 0.75; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), with pronounced benefits in patients aged 40–79 years. Both sexes and White and Black patients demonstrated significant reductions in risk. Concurrent medication use, such as statins (aHR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.91) and insulin (aHR 0.78; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.86), further enhanced the protective effects of GLP-1 RAs.\nThese findings suggest GLP-1 RAs as a promising therapeutic option for mitigating dementia risk in type 2 diabetes, particularly in older adults, females, and specific racial groups, while highlighting the need for tailored interventions based on individual characteristics.\nThis study represents the first and largest direct comparison of GLP-1 RAs and metformin in mitigating dementia risk among patients with T2DM. Historically, metformin has been the cornerstone of first-line therapy for T2DM due to its well-established efficacy in glycemic control and its potential neuroprotective effects.\nGLP-1 RAs demonstrate superior efficacy compared with metformin in reducing the risk of AD and other non-VaDs in patients with T2DM, as evidenced by our study and corroborated by other research. In our cohort, GLP-1 RA use was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of AD (AHR 0.88; 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94) and other non-VaDs (AHR 0.75; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.81) compared with metformin, underscoring their potential neuroprotective advantage. Similar findings have been reported in clinical trials and population-based studies. For instance, an RCT of liraglutide in patients with early AD demonstrated improvements in cognitive function and reductions in cerebral amyloid burden,\nThe differential effects of GLP-1 RAs and metformin on overall dementia and VaD highlight the complexity of their mechanisms and the pathophysiology of these conditions. Both medications demonstrate neuroprotective properties, such as reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, improving insulin sensitivity, and enhancing cerebrovascular health, which likely contribute to their benefits in overall dementia.\nGLP-1 RAs demonstrate substantial promise in reducing the risk of T2DM-related dementia, particularly AD and other non-VaDs, through their broad neuroprotective mechanisms (\nThis study represents the largest and most comprehensive evaluation of GLP-1 RAs compared with metformin as first-line antidiabetic therapies in mitigating the risk of T2DM-related dementia, with a specific emphasis on AD and other non-VaDs. Leveraging the global federated health research network, encompassing deidentified data from over 98 healthcare organizations worldwide, this analysis ensures broad generalizability and robust methodological rigor. Advanced techniques, including PSM and sensitivity analyses, minimized confounding and validated the robustness of the findings. GLP-1 RAs demonstrated significant reductions in AD risk (AHR 0.88; 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94) and other non-VaDs (AHR 0.75; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), consistent with prior research highlighting their neuroprotective mechanisms, such as reducing beta-amyloid accumulation, alleviating oxidative stress, and enhancing cerebral glucose metabolism.\nThis study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, as a retrospective cohort study using real-world data, the potential for residual confounding remains, despite rigorous PSM and sensitivity analyses. Second, the reliance on deidentified EHRs introduces variability in diagnostic coding, which may lead to misclassification of dementia subtypes or underreporting of outcomes, particularly VaD. Third, the exclusion of patients with prior exposure to both GLP-1 RAs and metformin may limit the generalizability to individuals with mixed treatment histories. Fourth, the follow-up period, while sufficient for observing dementia outcomes, may not fully capture long-term cognitive effects, especially given the progressive nature of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. Additionally, the absence of direct cognitive performance measurements or biomarkers (eg, amyloid or tau) limits mechanistic insights into the observed benefits of GLP-1 RAs. Lastly, although the study population was diverse, it may not represent certain high-risk groups, such as those with advanced diabetes complications or significant comorbidities. Despite these limitations, the findings remain robust, as the lower mortality in the GLP-1 RA group—paradoxically reducing dementia risk due to longer survival—suggests that the study may have underestimated the true neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 RAs compared with metformin. This underscores the potential superiority of GLP-1 RAs and highlights the need for further randomized controlled trials with extended follow-up, standardized diagnostics, and neuroimaging to validate these findings.\nOur study provides the largest comparison of GLP-1 RAs versus metformin in reducing T2DM-related dementia risk, particularly AD and non-VaDs. GLP-1 RAs exhibited superior efficacy over metformin in mitigating dementia risk, particularly for AD (AHR 0.88) and non-VaDs (AHR 0.75), likely through distinct neuroprotective mechanisms such as beta-amyloid clearance and enhanced cerebral glucose metabolism. Despite limitations such as residual confounding, the findings remain robust and suggest GLP-1 RAs could redefine T2DM-related dementia prevention strategies, warranting further RCTs to confirm these results.", "content_for_embedding": "Both glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and metformin have demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but no head-to-head real-world comparisons have evaluated their relative efficacy in preventing dementia.\nThis large-scale, propensity score–matched cohort study shows that GLP-1 RAs significantly reduce the risk of overall dementia—particularly Alzheimer’s disease and non-vascular dementias—compared with metformin when used as first-line therapy in patients with T2DM.\nThese findings support the early use of GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2DM at risk for cognitive decline and may influence future diabetes treatment guidelines to prioritize therapies with dual glycemic and neuroprotective benefits.\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing global public health challenge, with its rising prevalence imposing substantial burdens on healthcare systems worldwide.\nBoth glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and metformin, widely used in T2DM management, have been investigated for their potential to mitigate dementia risk.\nGiven the significant clinical and societal burden of T2DM-related dementia, determining which therapy—GLP-1 RAs or metformin—provides superior protection against cognitive decline is crucial.\nThis retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX global federated health research network, a robust platform comprising deidentified electronic health records (EHRs) from over 98 healthcare organizations worldwide. This database includes comprehensive longitudinal data on demographics, diagnoses, medications, laboratory results, and healthcare utilization, enabling precise cohort identification and robust outcome analyses. All data are deidentified in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring patient privacy.\nThis study compared adults with T2DM who initiated either GLP-1 RAs or metformin as first-line therapy between November 20, 2004, and November 20, 2024. Patients were identified from a global federated health network encompassing 98 healthcare organizations. Eligibility criteria included a T2DM diagnosis (ICD-10-CM E11.x) and a prescription for GLP-1 RAs (ATC A10BJ) or metformin (ATC A10BA). The index date was defined as the earliest prescription date post-diagnosis, with a minimum of 24 months of follow-up to ensure rigorous outcome assessment and reduce potential bias. The 24-month follow-up period was selected to ensure sufficient time to observe dementia outcomes while accommodating real-world study constraints. This duration captures incident cases and reduces biases from short-term fluctuations or diagnostic misclassifications. It aligns with prior research showing significant cognitive outcomes often emerge within 2–5 years of intervention.\nPatients were stratified into two treatment cohorts based on their initial antidiabetic therapy: the GLP-1 RA cohort and the metformin cohort. Cross-over between the two drug classes was prohibited to maintain treatment consistency, although the use of additional glucose-lowering medications—such as sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and insulins—was allowed if initiated after the index date. This strategy ensures that differences in observed outcomes can be attributed to the primary treatment, thereby minimizing confounding.\nTo strengthen methodological rigor, patients who had been prescribed newer agents, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i; ATC A10BK) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i; ATC A10BH), were excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, only patients with continuous prescriptions for their assigned therapy over a minimum duration of 6 months were included in the study population. This inclusion criterion ensured sustained exposure during the early treatment phase, thereby reducing the likelihood of treatment misclassification and enhancing the reliability of outcome assessment.\nTo ensure analytical validity, patients were excluded if they had prior exposure to the alternate drug class, pre-existing dementia diagnoses (ICD-10-CM F01: vascular dementia (VaD), G30: Alzheimer’s disease, F03: unspecified dementia), significant cognitive or neurological impairments, psychiatric disorders (ICD-10-CM F32–F39: depressive and mood disorders), Parkinson’s disease (ICD-10-CM G20), cerebral atherosclerosis (ICD-10-CM I67.2), or alcohol-related cognitive disorders (ICD-10-CM F10.27). Additionally, individuals with end-stage renal disease (ICD-10-CM N18.6) or undergoing dialysis within 6 months before the index date were excluded. These exclusion criteria ensured a precise and comprehensive comparison of GLP-1 RAs and metformin in reducing dementia risk, thereby providing reliable insights for clinical and real-world applications.\nThe primary outcome was the incidence of overall dementia, defined as the first occurrence of a diagnosis of VaD, AD, unspecified dementia, or dementia associated with other diseases. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of specific dementia subtypes, such as VaD, AD, and other forms of dementia, as well as all-cause mortality.\nTo address potential biases from pre-existing or undiagnosed dementia and to allow sufficient time for the therapeutic effects of the medications to manifest, a 6-month washout period was applied. Outcomes occurring within this interval were excluded from the analysis. Follow-up began on day 181 after the index date and continued until the first occurrence of an outcome, loss to follow-up, or the conclusion of the study period.\nPatients with prior diagnoses of dementia or who experienced all-cause mortality before the washout period were excluded. Additionally, participants with less than 24 months of follow-up after the washout period were excluded to ensure an adequate observation period for capturing meaningful clinical outcomes.\nTo address potential confounding factors, we adjusted for an extensive set of baseline covariates. These included demographic variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity), clinical characteristics (eg, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease), and laboratory measurements such as hemoglobin A1c and body mass index (BMI). Concomitant medication use, including insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and statins, was also accounted for (\nPropensity score matching (PSM) with a 1:1 nearest-neighbor algorithm and a caliper width of 0.1 was used to balance these covariates between the GLP-1 receptor agonist and metformin cohorts. The success of matching was validated by ensuring standardized mean differences (SMDs) of less than 0.1 for all covariates.\nTime-to-event outcomes, including dementia, were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves to estimate cumulative incidence and log-rank tests to compare dementia incidence between cohorts. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate HRs with 95% CIs, addressing residual imbalances in covariates following PSM. Schoenfeld residuals validated the proportional hazards assumption, ensuring the robustness of the models. To account for potential time-dependent effects of treatment, time-varying covariates were incorporated, allowing for dynamic assessment of changes in patient profiles and treatment exposures during follow-up.\nFollow-up started on day 181 post-index, following a 6-month washout period designed to reduce reverse causation bias by excluding outcomes that might be influenced by pre-existing conditions or early treatment effects. Sensitivity analyses were performed using the pre-PSM population to validate the primary findings. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for all baseline covariates from\nSubgroup analyses examined potential effect modifications based on baseline characteristics such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, concurrent medication use (eg, insulin, sulfonylureas, statins), and glycemic control categories (eg, hemoglobin A1c levels). Statistical significance was determined using a two-sided p value threshold of <0.05. All analyses were performed on the TriNetX platform, which adheres to stringent quality control standards and is validated for real-world data analyses. To enhance generalizability, key findings were replicated across independent database subsets and stratified by healthcare settings and geographic regions.\nIn this analysis, we compared the baseline characteristics of patients with T2DM receiving GLP-1 RAs or metformin as first-line antidiabetic therapy before and after PSM. Before matching, significant imbalances were noted in age, sex distribution, and comorbidity prevalence, including higher proportions of male patients and greater comorbidity burden among those treated with metformin. Additionally, metabolic measures, such as BMI and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), reflected more pronounced obesity and glycemic dysregulation in the GLP-1 RA group.\nAfter PSM, the two cohorts demonstrated excellent balance across key covariates, with absolute standardized mean differences (ASMDs) consistently below 0.1. The matched cohorts achieved comparability in age (mean age ~58 years), sex distribution (~36% male), comorbidity profiles (eg, similar rates of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease), and metabolic parameters (eg, HbA1c and BMI categories). This matching minimized baseline differences, ensuring the validity of subsequent analyses comparing dementia incidence and other outcomes between these two treatment groups.\nAmong 87,229 matched patients in each cohort, GLP-1 RA use was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of overall dementia compared with metformin (2.4% vs 4.8%; AHR 0.90; 95% CI 0.85 to 0.95) (\nAHR, adjusted HR; GLP-1 RA, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist.\nIn terms of secondary outcomes, the all-cause mortality rate was notably reduced in the GLP-1 RA group (4.8% vs 8.8%; AHR 0.89; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95). These findings underscore the potential advantages of GLP-1 RAs in mitigating dementia and mortality risks among patients with T2DMs.\nAcross all dementia outcomes, GLP-1 RAs demonstrated significant reductions in risk compared with metformin, particularly in older adults, females, and White and Black patients. For overall dementia, the aHR was 0.87 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.91; p<0.0001), with consistent findings across subgroups. The benefits were most pronounced in patients aged ≥60 years, with significant reductions noted in those aged 60–79 years (aHR 0.85; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.90) and ≥80 years (aHR 0.80; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.88). Both sexes benefited, although females had a slightly lower aHR (0.83; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.89) compared with males (0.90; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97).\nFor AD, GLP-1 RAs reduced risk by 12% overall (aHR 0.88; 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94). Older age groups, particularly those ≥60 years, experienced the strongest benefits, with females showing a more substantial reduction (aHR 0.82; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89). Racial subgroup analysis revealed significant reductions among White patients (aHR 0.85; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.92), while other racial groups showed limited effects.\nVaD risk showed no significant difference in the overall population (aHR 1.00; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.08), although females had a modest risk reduction (aHR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99). No consistent trends were observed across age or racial subgroups.\nFor other dementia subtypes, GLP-1 RAs provided a robust protective effect (aHR 0.75; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), with pronounced benefits in patients aged 40–79 years. Both sexes and White and Black patients demonstrated significant reductions in risk. Concurrent medication use, such as statins (aHR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.91) and insulin (aHR 0.78; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.86), further enhanced the protective effects of GLP-1 RAs.\nThese findings suggest GLP-1 RAs as a promising therapeutic option for mitigating dementia risk in type 2 diabetes, particularly in older adults, females, and specific racial groups, while highlighting the need for tailored interventions based on individual characteristics.\nThis study represents the first and largest direct comparison of GLP-1 RAs and metformin in mitigating dementia risk among patients with T2DM. Historically, metformin has been the cornerstone of first-line therapy for T2DM due to its well-established efficacy in glycemic control and its potential neuroprotective effects.\nGLP-1 RAs demonstrate superior efficacy compared with metformin in reducing the risk of AD and other non-VaDs in patients with T2DM, as evidenced by our study and corroborated by other research. In our cohort, GLP-1 RA use was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of AD (AHR 0.88; 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94) and other non-VaDs (AHR 0.75; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.81) compared with metformin, underscoring their potential neuroprotective advantage. Similar findings have been reported in clinical trials and population-based studies. For instance, an RCT of liraglutide in patients with early AD demonstrated improvements in cognitive function and reductions in cerebral amyloid burden,\nThe differential effects of GLP-1 RAs and metformin on overall dementia and VaD highlight the complexity of their mechanisms and the pathophysiology of these conditions. Both medications demonstrate neuroprotective properties, such as reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, improving insulin sensitivity, and enhancing cerebrovascular health, which likely contribute to their benefits in overall dementia.\nGLP-1 RAs demonstrate substantial promise in reducing the risk of T2DM-related dementia, particularly AD and other non-VaDs, through their broad neuroprotective mechanisms (\nThis study represents the largest and most comprehensive evaluation of GLP-1 RAs compared with metformin as first-line antidiabetic therapies in mitigating the risk of T2DM-related dementia, with a specific emphasis on AD and other non-VaDs. Leveraging the global federated health research network, encompassing deidentified data from over 98 healthcare organizations worldwide, this analysis ensures broad generalizability and robust methodological rigor. Advanced techniques, including PSM and sensitivity analyses, minimized confounding and validated the robustness of the findings. GLP-1 RAs demonstrated significant reductions in AD risk (AHR 0.88; 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94) and other non-VaDs (AHR 0.75; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), consistent with prior research highlighting their neuroprotective mechanisms, such as reducing beta-amyloid accumulation, alleviating oxidative stress, and enhancing cerebral glucose metabolism.\nThis study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, as a retrospective cohort study using real-world data, the potential for residual confounding remains, despite rigorous PSM and sensitivity analyses. Second, the reliance on deidentified EHRs introduces variability in diagnostic coding, which may lead to misclassification of dementia subtypes or underreporting of outcomes, particularly VaD. Third, the exclusion of patients with prior exposure to both GLP-1 RAs and metformin may limit the generalizability to individuals with mixed treatment histories. Fourth, the follow-up period, while sufficient for observing dementia outcomes, may not fully capture long-term cognitive effects, especially given the progressive nature of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. Additionally, the absence of direct cognitive performance measurements or biomarkers (eg, amyloid or tau) limits mechanistic insights into the observed benefits of GLP-1 RAs. Lastly, although the study population was diverse, it may not represent certain high-risk groups, such as those with advanced diabetes complications or significant comorbidities. Despite these limitations, the findings remain robust, as the lower mortality in the GLP-1 RA group—paradoxically reducing dementia risk due to longer survival—suggests that the study may have underestimated the true neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 RAs compared with metformin. This underscores the potential superiority of GLP-1 RAs and highlights the need for further randomized controlled trials with extended follow-up, standardized diagnostics, and neuroimaging to validate these findings.\nOur study provides the largest comparison of GLP-1 RAs versus metformin in reducing T2DM-related dementia risk, particularly AD and non-VaDs. GLP-1 RAs exhibited superior efficacy over metformin in mitigating dementia risk, particularly for AD (AHR 0.88) and non-VaDs (AHR 0.75), likely through distinct neuroprotective mechanisms such as beta-amyloid clearance and enhanced cerebral glucose metabolism.

However, the specific microbiota contributing to symptoms remain unclear. To characterize the gut microbial profile related to different symptoms and explore the mediation mechanism between microbiota alterations and the core ADHD symptoms, we conducted shotgun metagenomic sequencing and fecal metabolomics analysis on 94 ADHD patients and 94 age- and gender-matched controls. Microbial characteristics of three subgroups exhibiting different ADHD core symptom presentations were analyzed. We developed a metabolic model and conducted causal mediation analyses to examine how metabolites connect the microbiota to the symptoms. Fecal microbiota transplantation in mice was employed to validate the findings. The redundancy analysis identified ADHD symptoms as environmental gradients and explained the changes in beta diversity (F = 1.345, pFDR = 0.015). Greater gut microbial alterations were observed in combined presentations (ADHD-C). Several beneficial bacteria involved in short-chain fatty acid synthesis were found to be downregulated, with Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis notably linked to all three core symptoms (p.adj = 1.04E–13; p.adj = 5.07E–07; p.adj = 2.61E–05). Various taxa, functional pathways, and metabolites associated with specific ADHD symptom domains were identified. Imidazoleacetic acid partially mediated the effects between Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and inattention (p = 0.012). In mice subjected to feces from ADHD patients with a low abundance of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, treatment with this strain greatly improved both hyperactivity (t = 2.665, p = 0.0237) and inattention (t = 2.389, p = 0.0380), while acetate supplementation only alleviated inattention (t = 2.362, p = 0.0398). Our findings suggest that different ADHD symptoms were related to common and different gut microbiota and metabolites. Fecal microbiota transplantation in mice validated the hypothesis that gut microbial composition affects ADHD symptoms through metabolic alterations. This study provides more insight into the mechanisms underlying metabolic disturbances in ADHD and elucidates the role of gut microbiota in these processes.", "full_text": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric conditions in children and adolescents, with a global prevalence of 3–5%.\nAlthough ADHD is highly heritable,\nThrough the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), the effects of the gut microbiota on neurodevelopment have gained more recognition recently. The gut microbiota is commonly considered to regulate neurodevelopment through three pathways – the immune pathway, the neuronal pathway, and the endocrine/systemic pathway, with overlaps and interaction in between.\nResearch has shown that many ADHD-related risk factors also influence the microbiota, such as delivery method, gestational age, type of feeding, maternal health, and early life stressors.\nPrevious studies utilizing 16S rRNA gene amplicon or shotgun metagenomic sequencing have preliminarily identified differences in gut microbiota composition between ADHD and controls.\nOne hundred and eighty-eight participants aged 6–16 years were recruited from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Center at Peking University Sixth Hospital, Yan’an Third People’s Hospital, and local schools. Of these, 94 were ADHD patients and 94 were age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The initial diagnoses of patients were made by senior psychiatrists using the DSM-5 criteria,\nPatients with ADHD and healthy controls were excluded when they met the following exclusion criteria: (1) history of treatment with any medication for ADHD; (2) use of psychoactive drugs, antibiotics, probiotics, or traditional Chinese medicine within 1 month prior to sample collection; and (3) special dietary preferences (such as vegan or ketogenic diets) or significant changes in diet within the previous month. Participants were excluded if they had comorbid psychiatric, neurological, gastrointestinal, or metabolic conditions. Additionally, individuals with IQs below 70 according to Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices\nFollowing the guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, the research was granted authorization by the Ethics Committee of Peking University Sixth Hospital (Approval No. 2021–79). Informed consent was obtained from legal guardians, while children aged 8 years or older signed the informed consent on their own.\nADHD symptoms were measured using the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale,\nThe Children Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a widely recognized children behavior assessment tool,\nThe Conners Parental Symptom Questionnaire (PSQ) is completed by the child’s primary caregiver based on the child’s daily behavior.\nFood frequency questionnaires (FFQ) are an effective instrument for assessing typical dietary intake and its relationship with health and disease outcomes.\nStandardized procedures were followed for fecal sample collection, after which the samples were frozen at −80°C. Microbial DNA was extracted from 200 mg fecal samples from 188 participants using the QIAamp PowerFecal Pro DNA Kit. The DNA concentration was measured using a microplate reader, and its integrity was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis.\nSamples were sequenced on the MGISEQ 2000 platform by Beijing Genomics Institute using PE150 mode with an insert size of 300–400 bp. Prior to bioinformatic analysis, SOAPnuke (v.2.2.1)\nHigh-quality short reads from each DNA sample were assembled into contigs using a multiple k-mer size strategy with MEGAHIT software\nAll participants were initially assigned sequential subject identifiers upon recruitment. After completing fecal sample collection, all samples were randomly reordered using the sample() function in R software (version 4.2.0), and new identification numbers (ADHD: A001-A094; Controls: H001-H094) were assigned accordingly. Metabolomics profiling was performed on the first 31 ADHD patients (A001-A031) and 31 controls (H001-H031) based on the ascending order of these IDs. The 20 μL sample and 20 μL standard were mixed with HM400 releasing agent for extraction. Following centrifugation at 18,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant was collected for LC-MS/MS analysis.\nMetabolite separation and quantification were carried out using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC I-Class Plus (Waters, USA) in conjunction with a QTRAP 6500+ high-sensitivity mass spectrometer (SCIEX, USA). Chromatographic separation was achieved using a BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 10 cm, 1.7 μm; Waters). The QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer, equipped with an ESI Turbo Ion Spray interface, was operated with the following parameters: ion source temperature at 400°C, ion spray voltage (IS) at 4500 V (positive mode) and −4500 V (negative mode), and ion source gases I (GS1), II (GS2), and curtain gas (CUR) set to 60, 60, and 35 psi, respectively.\nQuantitative analysis was performed using Skyline software (v.21.1.0.146). This software, configured for monoisotopic peaks with a mass tolerance of 0.6 Da and a mass range of 50–1500 Da, was used to generate a data matrix that included metabolite identification and quantification results for subsequent information analysis and processing. Quality control (QC) samples were generated from a mixture of sample extracts to assess the consistency of the sample under identical treatment. During data collection, a certain number of QC samples were inserted in test samples to monitor the repeatability of the analytical process. The results exported by Skyline software were imported into metaX\nMetabolic pathways were identified using open database sources such as MetaboAnalyst, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database, and the Human Metabolome Database.\nFour-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (initial weight 13–16 g; Gempharmatech Co., Ltd) were housed at a temperature of 22–23°C on a 12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food except during experimental sessions. The study was approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of Peking University. After the acclimatization period, mice were orally administered a cocktail of four antibiotics (ABX) for 7 days: ampicillin (200 mg/kg/day, Solarbio Cat#A6920), vancomycin (100 mg/kg/day, VIANEX S.A. PLANTC), neomycin (200 mg/kg/day, SIGMA Cat#N6386), and metronidazole (200 mg/kg/day, SIGMA Cat#M1547).\nSubsequently, mice were subjected to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from ADHD patients with a low abundance of beneficial bacteria\nBehavioral experiments were conducted during the light period. Exploratory activity and hyperactivity behavior were measured using an Open-Field apparatus (40 × 40 × 25 cm). For the five days prior to the test, the mice were handled for 5 min every day, followed by a 5-min familiarization period in the box. Each mouse was placed in the center of the open-field apparatus. A square that was 10 cm from the wall was designated as the center zone. Traveled distance and time spent in the center zone of each animal were recorded for a single 4-min session with a video-imaging system.\nMice were trained using a Five-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5-CSRTT) procedure according to a published protocol and previous studies.\nDuring training, the LED of one of the five response holes will be on, and mice were trained to use their noses to locate the lit hole in order to receive a food pellet as a reward. Each session began with the illumination of the response holes light and the food magazine light, followed by the delivery of one food pellet (20 mg/pellet). Once the first food pellet was collected, the intertrial interval (ITI) commenced. At the end of the ITI, one of the five response holes on the chamber wall opposite the food magazine was illuminated for a brief period, known as the stimulus duration (SD). A correct response to this hole within the limited hold (LH) period resulted in the response holes light turning off, the food magazine light turning on, and delivery of one food pellet. After the pellet was collected, the next ITI began. The target stimulus varied pseudorandomly between trials to increase attentional load.\nTraining was divided into seven successive stages with specific criteria for ITI, SD, and LH, which had to be met for two consecutive days before progression to the next stage (Supplementary Fig. 6). A typical training session lasted 30 min or completed 100 trials, whichever came first. Responses into the non-target hole were considered incorrect responses, while responses during the ITI before target stimulus presentation were classified as premature responses, and a failure to respond was recorded as an omission. The average latency to correct responses and correct responses rate reflected the mice’s attention; the premature rate indicated the level of impulsivity.\nMice feces were collected before and after antibiotic treatment (ABX), after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and after the rescue procedure (\nAfter obtaining genus-level ASVs, the data were normalized to ensure sample comparability; sequence count normalization was conducted through rarefaction to address uneven sequencing depths by the ‘rrarefy’ function in Vegan,\nStatistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.2.0) and Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, version 26.0). Mean and standard deviation were utilized for continuous variables (including demographic data, dietary data, and psychometric parameters). Kruskal – Wallis tests and post-hoc Wilcoxon rank-sum pairwise tests, with p-values adjusted for multiple testing via the Benjamini – Hochberg method, were applied for inter-group comparisons. Correlation analysis was conducted using partial correlation analysis by the “spearman” method in the R package ppcor. When applicable, age, gender, BMI, SPM, site and principal component of diets were adjusted as covariates. A two-tailed p-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nWe performed power analysis and created the species rarefaction curves by the function ‘specaccum’ in the R package vegan\nTo analyze the interrelationship between the microbiota present in stool samples and ADHD symptoms, we used redundancy analysis (RDA) from the R package vegan,\nTo identify significant biomarkers, we compared all species between two groups using LEfSe analysis, which assisted in identifying genomic biomarkers that characterize statistical differences between biological groups.\nFor metabolomics, after normalization to total peak intensity, the multivariate data were dimensionally reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze groupings, trends (intra-group and inter-group similarities and differences), and outliers in the data set. Using Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) of the R package mixOmics\nTo further investigate the correlation between gut microbiota function and fecal metabolites, we employed the MIMOSA model from the R package MIMOSA2.\nThe causal mediation analysis was conducted to explore the influence and interactions of microbiota and metabolites, using the ‘mediate’ function in the R package mediation.\nA total of 188 children and adolescents, consisting of 94 patients with ADHD (56 ADHD-I, 29 ADHD-C, 9 ADHD-HI) and 94 TDs, were recruited.\nDemographics, intelligence, and clinical symptoms of ADHD subgroup and typically developing controls (TD) in the study cohort.\nBMI, body mass index; SPM, Raven’s Standard Progress Matrice;\nWe carried out shotgun metagenomic sequencing for all participants and obtained an average of 9,973,835,522 clean bases per sample. Detailed information on gut microbiota sequencing data was given in Supplementary Table 3. We employed species rarefaction curves to assess and predict the degree to which species richness in the community increases with sample size. The curve for groups TD, IA, and C exhibited a flat trajectory during the terminal phases, indicating that the sample sizes were adequate and the subsequent analyses were reasonable (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nIn terms of taxonomic diversity, we first compared the top 10 relative abundances of microbiota at the level of genus, the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio), alpha diversity, and beta diversity between ADHD subgroups and TDs. The relative abundance of the top 10 genera of microbiota (Phocaeicola, Bacteroides, Alistipes, Parabacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Bifidobacterium, Escherichia, Lachnospira, Megamonas, and others) did not differ significantly (pFDR >0.05;\nThe overview of the microbiome profiles in three ADHD presentations and TD.

S.obs (observed species) were used to estimate the indexes of the total number of species in the community. Shannon index, Simpson index, and Pielou’s evenness index were used to measure the microbial diversity in the sample. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) whole tree was the diversity index calculated the distance of the evolutionary tree.\nThe significance tests of the community structure with greater between-group difference than the within-group difference.\nAnosim similarity analysis is a non-parametric test to test whether the between-group difference is significantly greater than the difference within the group to judge whether the grouping is meaningful. MRPP analysis is similar to Anosim analysis, but the ordering method is different. It analyzes whether the microbial community structure difference between groups is significant. Adonis tests the differences between groups by partitioning the distance matrix among sources of variation and using a permutation test to assess the significance of these differences.\nFurthermore, we used constrained ordination analysis to investigate the correlation between the microbial community structure and ADHD symptoms in all participants. To identify the optimal distribution of our data model (either a linear, unimodal, or bimodal distribution), we implemented a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). The length value indicated that the linear model fitted our data, with the first axis (DCA1) having a length of 2.58 (less than 3) (Supplementary Table 4). We applied the redundancy analysis (RDA) to a linear model.

Species\nAfter gene prediction, the total number of genes we obtained and the distribution of genes with different lengths were displayed in Supplementary Figure 2. First, we assessed the microbial function annotated by the KEGG database. We totally annotated the genes expressed by the microbiota to 5 pathways at Level 1, 29 pathways at Level 2, 202 pathways at Level 3, and 6935 KEGG orthology (Supplementary Fig. 3). We next focused on all metabolic pathways of Level 3 and employed STAMP to identify 11 differential pathways between group TD and group C (\nIn group C, tryptophan metabolism, biotin metabolism, histidine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids were downregulated, while lysine biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis were upregulated (\nFurthermore, we employed partial correlation analysis to investigate relationships between three domains of ADHD symptoms and KEGG pathways, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, SPM, site, and dietary variables. Results demonstrated that biotin metabolism showed negative correlations with all three symptoms, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis displayed positive correlations with all symptoms (\nSimilarly, pathways demonstrating consistent results in both comparative analysis and correlation analysis were considered more robust. The biotin metabolism pathway showed increased abundance in group TD in all three pairs of comparisons, and correlation analysis also demonstrated that this pathway was negatively correlated with all three ADHD symptoms. The relative abundance of tryptophan metabolism was downregulated in group IA and group C and the pathway also showed a negative correlation with inattention symptoms. The relative abundance of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis was upregulated in group HA and group C, and the pathway also showed a positive correlation with impulsivity symptoms. In addition, group C, which exhibited symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, demonstrated differences in biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid metabolism, and histidine metabolism. Correspondingly, correlation analysis revealed that the first two pathways were associated with inattention, while histidine metabolism was associated with impulsivity.\nTo further elucidate the alterations in bacterial metabolism, we conducted untargeted metabolomics using fecal samples. The baseline comparison results between metabolomic subgroups and the full cohort are provided in Supplementary Table 7. No significant differences were observed in all these key variables, which supported the representativeness of the metabolomic subgroups. A total of 307 metabolites were identified, with classifications and the number of each class presented in Supplementary Figure 4. The comprehensive details of each identified metabolite are presented in Supplementary Table 8.\nBased on the differential metabolite screening criteria, there were 21 downregulated metabolites identified in group ADHD compared to group TD (\n(A) Volcano plot of the different metabolites between group ADHD and group TD.

After adjusting various confounding factors, we found that inattention symptom was negatively correlated with 12-hydroxystearic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid, lithocholic acid acetate methyl ester, vanillin, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, imidazoleacetic acid, 12-tridecanoic acid, and taurochendeoxycholic acid. Hyperactivity symptom was negatively correlated with 12-hydroxystearic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid, lithocholic acid acetate methyl ester, linoleic acid, 3,6-diketocholanic acid ethyl ester, and quinolinic acid. Impulsivity symptoms also had a negative correlation with vanillin, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, quinolinic acid, and ricinoleic acid (\nTo further explore the association between metagenomics and metabolomics between groups, we used the MIMOSA model to predict the impact of gut microbiota composition or function on metabolite concentrations. Based on the metabolic network approach, we then identified eight metabolites regulated by gut microbiome functions, which were annotated by KEGG orthology, including 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid, imidazoleacetic acid, hydroxyproline, 4-aminobutyric acid, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, L-asparagine, D-xylose, and pidolic acid. Importantly, imidazoleacetic acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, and 4-guanidinobutyric acid were previously identified as key differential metabolites between group ADHD and group TD, and all three are classified as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). It is noteworthy that the top producing pathways of these three metabolites are\nResults of MIMOSA model to predict the impact of gut microbiota composition or function on metabolite concentrations.\nID: KEGG compound ID for that metabolite; R\nTo investigate the influence and interactions of microbiota and metabolites on ADHD, we selected differential species and metabolites most strongly correlated with ADHD symptoms. The causal mediation analysis indicated a total effect of\nTo verify the pathway from microbiota to metabolites and subsequently to ADHD symptoms, we conducted a fecal microbiota transplantation experiment in mice. Detailed information on the sequencing data of mice fecal samples was presented in Supplementary Table 12. The 16S rRNA analysis of mice fecal microbiota showed a significant reduction in alpha diversity following treatment with ABX. In terms of beta diversity, the microbiota of ABX-treated mice exhibited a distinct distribution pattern compared to wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 7). These findings validated the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in altering the gut microbiota. After fecal microbiota transplantation from different sources, we observed that mice subjected to feces from ADHD patients with a low abundance of beneficial bacteria in group FMT-A exhibited hyperactive behavior (\nIn the rescue experiments for mice exhibiting ADHD-related symptoms after receiving FMT from ADHD patients, we found that compared to the control group (FMT-A-C), group FMT-A-R1, which received treatment with\n(A) workflow diagram of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and rescue experiments in mice.

While comparing gut microbiota taxa between ADHD subgroups and group TD, there were no significant differences observed in alpha diversity between patients with ADHD and TDs, which aligns with several previous studies.\nTo explore the relationship between taxa and ADHD symptoms, we employed LEfSe analysis between ADHD subgroups exhibiting different domains of symptoms and group TD, as well as correlation analysis between symptoms and microbiota. Microbial features that exhibited consistent results were deemed more robust. The LEfSe analysis of the ADHD subgroups and group TD revealed that the family\nRegarding the harmful bacteria enriched in ADHD groups or positively correlated with ADHD symptoms, both methods identified\nThe analysis of predicted microbial functions revealed significant differences between ADHD subgroups and group TD. The most significant pathways include several amino acid-related pathways, such as tryptophan metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and lysine biosynthesis. As Li et al. reported, gut microbiota actively reshapes the host’s amino acid balance through the metabolism of intestinal amino acids.\nOur analysis of metagenomic functional pathways and fecal metabolites concurrently revealed a downregulation of both fatty acid metabolism and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in ADHD. The most significantly enriched process was the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids, including MUFAs,\nIn addition, through the correlation analysis of metabolomics and metagenomics, we identified eight metabolites regulated by gut microbiota functions, three of which (imidazoleacetic acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, and 4-guanidinobutyric acid) also exhibited significant differences between groups. The three metabolites are categorized as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and we have also identified several key enzymes that contribute significantly to their synthesis. This suggests that the impact of gut microbiota on ADHD pathogenesis may be mediated through the synthesis of SCFAs by regulating the expression of certain enzymes. Consistent with our findings, in previous studies, aberrant levels of SCFAs have been implicated in disease pathogenesis and are generally present in diminished quantities.\nIn summary, in the analysis of linear discriminant analysis and symptom-related species from metagenomics, we identified probiotics primarily responsible for the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This aligns with the findings from the association analysis between metagenomics and metabolomics, where the metabolites modulated by gut microbiota and significantly downregulated in cases were primarily SCFAs. Additionally, the important overlapped pathways in the metagenomic differential functional pathways and the differential metabolites enrichment analysis were fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, with SCFAs being one of the key substances involved in these pathways. These findings collectively reveal a disturbance in fatty acid metabolism associated with the pathogenesis of ADHD. To further validate the hypothesis that SCFA-producing microbes affect ADHD pathogenesis through the mediation of SCFAs, we conducted a causal mediation analysis. The results confirmed that\nThe main strengths of our study include a larger sample size of the Chinese population compared to previous studies. At the same time, we excluded participants with other psychiatric, neurological, gastrointestinal, and metabolic conditions, as well as those with active use of psychoactive drugs, antibiotics, and probiotics. Methodologically, we employed shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which offers greater species identification depth compared to 16S rRNA sequencing. In terms of analysis, we conducted subgroup analyses of ADHD clinical symptoms, and the comparison between group C and group TD provided more comprehensive and detailed information that may have been overlooked without the application of subgroup analysis. Regarding study content, previous research has mostly focused on measuring plasma concentrations of amino acids and fatty acids as well as analyzing their correlation with clinical symptoms. In contrast, our study, for the first time, investigates the pathogenic role of gut microbiota in ADHD through species variations, gene pathway expression and fecal-targeted metabolomics. Specifically, it reveals the involvement of gut microbiota in disrupted fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, particularly in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, we formulated a hypothesis that gut microbiota affects ADHD symptoms through metabolic variations. We then subsequently conducted fecal microbiota transplantation experiment in mice to validate the hypothesis. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying metabolic disturbances in ADHD and addresses gaps in previous studies by linking the gut-brain axis mechanism to ADHD through gut microbiota profiles.\nThere are also some limitations to our study. First, excluding patients with gastrointestinal conditions or special diets may preclude participants with more aberrant microbiota compositions, thereby hindering the detection of correlations between gastrointestinal symptoms, food style, and microbial profiles. Second, due to the lower prevalence of the hyperactive/impulsive subtype in clinical settings, the sample size of group HA in our cohort might have been underpowered, and the sample size for each subgroup might be imbalanced. To address this problem, we emphasize the convergent evidence from our correlation analysis between microbial taxa, functions, and symptoms, which partially mitigates subgroup limitations. Third, we performed a cross-sectional study, which does not allow for confirming the causal directions between the correlational link between differential species, functional pathways, fecal metabolites, and the disease or symptoms. To address this problem, we conducted animal experiments; however, further longitudinal work in human populations should be undertaken to assess age-associated and other variations in gut microbiota.\nBuilding upon our findings and the current progress of gut-brain axis research, large-scale prospective longitudinal studies are essential to track the dynamic development of the gut microbiome and its relationship with the onset, progression, and symptom fluctuation of ADHD. In parallel, well-designed randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of dietary modifications, specific prebiotics, probiotics, or microbiota transplantation are warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting microbial and metabolic dysbiosis in ADHD. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations into how gut microbes and their metabolites influence gut-brain signaling pathways, along with integrative multi-omics approaches encompassing host genetics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, will be crucial for advancing our understanding of the complex biological underpinnings of ADHD and identifying novel therapeutic targets.\nIn conclusion, our study characterized the distinct gut microbiota and fetal metabolite profiles in patients with ADHD and its subtypes. We observed more gut microbial alterations in patients from group C compared to those in group IA or HA. Moreover, we employed metagenomics and fecal metabolomics techniques for the first time to elucidate the role of gut microbiota in the dysregulation of fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, with a particular focus on the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and SCFAs. Through causal mediation analysis of population sample data and mouse experiments of fecal microbiota transplantation, we further validated the pathway from microbiota to metabolites and subsequently to ADHD symptoms. The study provides new evidence supporting the association between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and ADHD and contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying these metabolic disturbances in ADHD.", "content_for_embedding": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric conditions in children and adolescents, with a global prevalence of 3–5%.\nAlthough ADHD is highly heritable,\nThrough the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), the effects of the gut microbiota on neurodevelopment have gained more recognition recently. The gut microbiota is commonly considered to regulate neurodevelopment through three pathways – the immune pathway, the neuronal pathway, and the endocrine/systemic pathway, with overlaps and interaction in between.\nResearch has shown that many ADHD-related risk factors also influence the microbiota, such as delivery method, gestational age, type of feeding, maternal health, and early life stressors.\nPrevious studies utilizing 16S rRNA gene amplicon or shotgun metagenomic sequencing have preliminarily identified differences in gut microbiota composition between ADHD and controls.\nOne hundred and eighty-eight participants aged 6–16 years were recruited from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Center at Peking University Sixth Hospital, Yan’an Third People’s Hospital, and local schools. Of these, 94 were ADHD patients and 94 were age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The initial diagnoses of patients were made by senior psychiatrists using the DSM-5 criteria,\nPatients with ADHD and healthy controls were excluded when they met the following exclusion criteria: (1) history of treatment with any medication for ADHD; (2) use of psychoactive drugs, antibiotics, probiotics, or traditional Chinese medicine within 1 month prior to sample collection; and (3) special dietary preferences (such as vegan or ketogenic diets) or significant changes in diet within the previous month.

After completing fecal sample collection, all samples were randomly reordered using the sample() function in R software (version 4.2.0), and new identification numbers (ADHD: A001-A094; Controls: H001-H094) were assigned accordingly. Metabolomics profiling was performed on the first 31 ADHD patients (A001-A031) and 31 controls (H001-H031) based on the ascending order of these IDs. The 20 μL sample and 20 μL standard were mixed with HM400 releasing agent for extraction. Following centrifugation at 18,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant was collected for LC-MS/MS analysis.\nMetabolite separation and quantification were carried out using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC I-Class Plus (Waters, USA) in conjunction with a QTRAP 6500+ high-sensitivity mass spectrometer (SCIEX, USA). Chromatographic separation was achieved using a BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 10 cm, 1.7 μm; Waters). The QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer, equipped with an ESI Turbo Ion Spray interface, was operated with the following parameters: ion source temperature at 400°C, ion spray voltage (IS) at 4500 V (positive mode) and −4500 V (negative mode), and ion source gases I (GS1), II (GS2), and curtain gas (CUR) set to 60, 60, and 35 psi, respectively.\nQuantitative analysis was performed using Skyline software (v.21.1.0.146). This software, configured for monoisotopic peaks with a mass tolerance of 0.6 Da and a mass range of 50–1500 Da, was used to generate a data matrix that included metabolite identification and quantification results for subsequent information analysis and processing. Quality control (QC) samples were generated from a mixture of sample extracts to assess the consistency of the sample under identical treatment. During data collection, a certain number of QC samples were inserted in test samples to monitor the repeatability of the analytical process. The results exported by Skyline software were imported into metaX\nMetabolic pathways were identified using open database sources such as MetaboAnalyst, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database, and the Human Metabolome Database.\nFour-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (initial weight 13–16 g; Gempharmatech Co., Ltd) were housed at a temperature of 22–23°C on a 12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food except during experimental sessions. The study was approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of Peking University. After the acclimatization period, mice were orally administered a cocktail of four antibiotics (ABX) for 7 days: ampicillin (200 mg/kg/day, Solarbio Cat#A6920), vancomycin (100 mg/kg/day, VIANEX S.A. PLANTC), neomycin (200 mg/kg/day, SIGMA Cat#N6386), and metronidazole (200 mg/kg/day, SIGMA Cat#M1547).\nSubsequently, mice were subjected to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from ADHD patients with a low abundance of beneficial bacteria\nBehavioral experiments were conducted during the light period. Exploratory activity and hyperactivity behavior were measured using an Open-Field apparatus (40 × 40 × 25 cm). For the five days prior to the test, the mice were handled for 5 min every day, followed by a 5-min familiarization period in the box. Each mouse was placed in the center of the open-field apparatus. A square that was 10 cm from the wall was designated as the center zone. Traveled distance and time spent in the center zone of each animal were recorded for a single 4-min session with a video-imaging system.\nMice were trained using a Five-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5-CSRTT) procedure according to a published protocol and previous studies.\nDuring training, the LED of one of the five response holes will be on, and mice were trained to use their noses to locate the lit hole in order to receive a food pellet as a reward. Each session began with the illumination of the response holes light and the food magazine light, followed by the delivery of one food pellet (20 mg/pellet). Once the first food pellet was collected, the intertrial interval (ITI) commenced. At the end of the ITI, one of the five response holes on the chamber wall opposite the food magazine was illuminated for a brief period, known as the stimulus duration (SD). A correct response to this hole within the limited hold (LH) period resulted in the response holes light turning off, the food magazine light turning on, and delivery of one food pellet. After the pellet was collected, the next ITI began. The target stimulus varied pseudorandomly between trials to increase attentional load.\nTraining was divided into seven successive stages with specific criteria for ITI, SD, and LH, which had to be met for two consecutive days before progression to the next stage (Supplementary Fig. 6). A typical training session lasted 30 min or completed 100 trials, whichever came first. Responses into the non-target hole were considered incorrect responses, while responses during the ITI before target stimulus presentation were classified as premature responses, and a failure to respond was recorded as an omission. The average latency to correct responses and correct responses rate reflected the mice’s attention; the premature rate indicated the level of impulsivity.\nMice feces were collected before and after antibiotic treatment (ABX), after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and after the rescue procedure (\nAfter obtaining genus-level ASVs, the data were normalized to ensure sample comparability; sequence count normalization was conducted through rarefaction to address uneven sequencing depths by the ‘rrarefy’ function in Vegan,\nStatistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.2.0) and Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, version 26.0).

MRPP analysis is similar to Anosim analysis, but the ordering method is different. It analyzes whether the microbial community structure difference between groups is significant. Adonis tests the differences between groups by partitioning the distance matrix among sources of variation and using a permutation test to assess the significance of these differences.\nFurthermore, we used constrained ordination analysis to investigate the correlation between the microbial community structure and ADHD symptoms in all participants. To identify the optimal distribution of our data model (either a linear, unimodal, or bimodal distribution), we implemented a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). The length value indicated that the linear model fitted our data, with the first axis (DCA1) having a length of 2.58 (less than 3) (Supplementary Table 4). We applied the redundancy analysis (RDA) to a linear model.

We next focused on all metabolic pathways of Level 3 and employed STAMP to identify 11 differential pathways between group TD and group C (\nIn group C, tryptophan metabolism, biotin metabolism, histidine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids were downregulated, while lysine biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis were upregulated (\nFurthermore, we employed partial correlation analysis to investigate relationships between three domains of ADHD symptoms and KEGG pathways, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, SPM, site, and dietary variables.

The biotin metabolism pathway showed increased abundance in group TD in all three pairs of comparisons, and correlation analysis also demonstrated that this pathway was negatively correlated with all three ADHD symptoms. The relative abundance of tryptophan metabolism was downregulated in group IA and group C and the pathway also showed a negative correlation with inattention symptoms. The relative abundance of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis was upregulated in group HA and group C, and the pathway also showed a positive correlation with impulsivity symptoms. In addition, group C, which exhibited symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, demonstrated differences in biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid metabolism, and histidine metabolism. Correspondingly, correlation analysis revealed that the first two pathways were associated with inattention, while histidine metabolism was associated with impulsivity.\nTo further elucidate the alterations in bacterial metabolism, we conducted untargeted metabolomics using fecal samples.

A total of 307 metabolites were identified, with classifications and the number of each class presented in Supplementary Figure 4. The comprehensive details of each identified metabolite are presented in Supplementary Table 8.\nBased on the differential metabolite screening criteria, there were 21 downregulated metabolites identified in group ADHD compared to group TD (\n(A) Volcano plot of the different metabolites between group ADHD and group TD.

After adjusting various confounding factors, we found that inattention symptom was negatively correlated with 12-hydroxystearic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid, lithocholic acid acetate methyl ester, vanillin, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, imidazoleacetic acid, 12-tridecanoic acid, and taurochendeoxycholic acid. Hyperactivity symptom was negatively correlated with 12-hydroxystearic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid, lithocholic acid acetate methyl ester, linoleic acid, 3,6-diketocholanic acid ethyl ester, and quinolinic acid. Impulsivity symptoms also had a negative correlation with vanillin, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, quinolinic acid, and ricinoleic acid (\nTo further explore the association between metagenomics and metabolomics between groups, we used the MIMOSA model to predict the impact of gut microbiota composition or function on metabolite concentrations. Based on the metabolic network approach, we then identified eight metabolites regulated by gut microbiome functions, which were annotated by KEGG orthology, including 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid, imidazoleacetic acid, hydroxyproline, 4-aminobutyric acid, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, L-asparagine, D-xylose, and pidolic acid. Importantly, imidazoleacetic acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, and 4-guanidinobutyric acid were previously identified as key differential metabolites between group ADHD and group TD, and all three are classified as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). It is noteworthy that the top producing pathways of these three metabolites are\nResults of MIMOSA model to predict the impact of gut microbiota composition or function on metabolite concentrations.\nID: KEGG compound ID for that metabolite; R\nTo investigate the influence and interactions of microbiota and metabolites on ADHD, we selected differential species and metabolites most strongly correlated with ADHD symptoms. The causal mediation analysis indicated a total effect of\nTo verify the pathway from microbiota to metabolites and subsequently to ADHD symptoms, we conducted a fecal microbiota transplantation experiment in mice. Detailed information on the sequencing data of mice fecal samples was presented in Supplementary Table 12. The 16S rRNA analysis of mice fecal microbiota showed a significant reduction in alpha diversity following treatment with ABX. In terms of beta diversity, the microbiota of ABX-treated mice exhibited a distinct distribution pattern compared to wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 7). These findings validated the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in altering the gut microbiota. After fecal microbiota transplantation from different sources, we observed that mice subjected to feces from ADHD patients with a low abundance of beneficial bacteria in group FMT-A exhibited hyperactive behavior (\nIn the rescue experiments for mice exhibiting ADHD-related symptoms after receiving FMT from ADHD patients, we found that compared to the control group (FMT-A-C), group FMT-A-R1, which received treatment with\n(A) workflow diagram of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and rescue experiments in mice.

While comparing gut microbiota taxa between ADHD subgroups and group TD, there were no significant differences observed in alpha diversity between patients with ADHD and TDs, which aligns with several previous studies.\nTo explore the relationship between taxa and ADHD symptoms, we employed LEfSe analysis between ADHD subgroups exhibiting different domains of symptoms and group TD, as well as correlation analysis between symptoms and microbiota. Microbial features that exhibited consistent results were deemed more robust. The LEfSe analysis of the ADHD subgroups and group TD revealed that the family\nRegarding the harmful bacteria enriched in ADHD groups or positively correlated with ADHD symptoms, both methods identified\nThe analysis of predicted microbial functions revealed significant differences between ADHD subgroups and group TD. The most significant pathways include several amino acid-related pathways, such as tryptophan metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and lysine biosynthesis. As Li et al. reported, gut microbiota actively reshapes the host’s amino acid balance through the metabolism of intestinal amino acids.\nOur analysis of metagenomic functional pathways and fecal metabolites concurrently revealed a downregulation of both fatty acid metabolism and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in ADHD. The most significantly enriched process was the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids, including MUFAs,\nIn addition, through the correlation analysis of metabolomics and metagenomics, we identified eight metabolites regulated by gut microbiota functions, three of which (imidazoleacetic acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, and 4-guanidinobutyric acid) also exhibited significant differences between groups. The three metabolites are categorized as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and we have also identified several key enzymes that contribute significantly to their synthesis. This suggests that the impact of gut microbiota on ADHD pathogenesis may be mediated through the synthesis of SCFAs by regulating the expression of certain enzymes. Consistent with our findings, in previous studies, aberrant levels of SCFAs have been implicated in disease pathogenesis and are generally present in diminished quantities.\nIn summary, in the analysis of linear discriminant analysis and symptom-related species from metagenomics, we identified probiotics primarily responsible for the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This aligns with the findings from the association analysis between metagenomics and metabolomics, where the metabolites modulated by gut microbiota and significantly downregulated in cases were primarily SCFAs. Additionally, the important overlapped pathways in the metagenomic differential functional pathways and the differential metabolites enrichment analysis were fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, with SCFAs being one of the key substances involved in these pathways. These findings collectively reveal a disturbance in fatty acid metabolism associated with the pathogenesis of ADHD. To further validate the hypothesis that SCFA-producing microbes affect ADHD pathogenesis through the mediation of SCFAs, we conducted a causal mediation analysis. The results confirmed that\nThe main strengths of our study include a larger sample size of the Chinese population compared to previous studies. At the same time, we excluded participants with other psychiatric, neurological, gastrointestinal, and metabolic conditions, as well as those with active use of psychoactive drugs, antibiotics, and probiotics. Methodologically, we employed shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which offers greater species identification depth compared to 16S rRNA sequencing. In terms of analysis, we conducted subgroup analyses of ADHD clinical symptoms, and the comparison between group C and group TD provided more comprehensive and detailed information that may have been overlooked without the application of subgroup analysis. Regarding study content, previous research has mostly focused on measuring plasma concentrations of amino acids and fatty acids as well as analyzing their correlation with clinical symptoms. In contrast, our study, for the first time, investigates the pathogenic role of gut microbiota in ADHD through species variations, gene pathway expression and fecal-targeted metabolomics. Specifically, it reveals the involvement of gut microbiota in disrupted fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, particularly in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, we formulated a hypothesis that gut microbiota affects ADHD symptoms through metabolic variations. We then subsequently conducted fecal microbiota transplantation experiment in mice to validate the hypothesis. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying metabolic disturbances in ADHD and addresses gaps in previous studies by linking the gut-brain axis mechanism to ADHD through gut microbiota profiles.\nThere are also some limitations to our study. First, excluding patients with gastrointestinal conditions or special diets may preclude participants with more aberrant microbiota compositions, thereby hindering the detection of correlations between gastrointestinal symptoms, food style, and microbial profiles. Second, due to the lower prevalence of the hyperactive/impulsive subtype in clinical settings, the sample size of group HA in our cohort might have been underpowered, and the sample size for each subgroup might be imbalanced. To address this problem, we emphasize the convergent evidence from our correlation analysis between microbial taxa, functions, and symptoms, which partially mitigates subgroup limitations. Third, we performed a cross-sectional study, which does not allow for confirming the causal directions between the correlational link between differential species, functional pathways, fecal metabolites, and the disease or symptoms. To address this problem, we conducted animal experiments; however, further longitudinal work in human populations should be undertaken to assess age-associated and other variations in gut microbiota.\nBuilding upon our findings and the current progress of gut-brain axis research, large-scale prospective longitudinal studies are essential to track the dynamic development of the gut microbiome and its relationship with the onset, progression, and symptom fluctuation of ADHD. In parallel, well-designed randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of dietary modifications, specific prebiotics, probiotics, or microbiota transplantation are warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting microbial and metabolic dysbiosis in ADHD. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations into how gut microbes and their metabolites influence gut-brain signaling pathways, along with integrative multi-omics approaches encompassing host genetics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, will be crucial for advancing our understanding of the complex biological underpinnings of ADHD and identifying novel therapeutic targets.\nIn conclusion, our study characterized the distinct gut microbiota and fetal metabolite profiles in patients with ADHD and its subtypes. We observed more gut microbial alterations in patients from group C compared to those in group IA or HA. Moreover, we employed metagenomics and fecal metabolomics techniques for the first time to elucidate the role of gut microbiota in the dysregulation of fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, with a particular focus on the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and SCFAs. Through causal mediation analysis of population sample data and mouse experiments of fecal microbiota transplantation, we further validated the pathway from microbiota to metabolites and subsequently to ADHD symptoms. The study provides new evidence supporting the association between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and ADHD and contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying these metabolic disturbances in ADHD.", "topic": "Social_neurology"}

Individuals with severe scalp skin lesions, such as unhealed wounds, recent scar tissue, or broken skin, were excluded. Those who had undergone brain surgery and had a hearing device, or any implanted metal or electronic objects in the upper part of their body, like a pacemaker, were also ineligible to participate.\nParticipants were recruited through advertisements placed on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Additionally, flyers in public spaces and presentations were employed to attract potential participants. To initiate the recruitment process, individuals interested in the study contacted the study investigator using the details provided in the advertisements. The research staff then provided the Participant Information Sheet, the informed consent form, and details about the Ministry of Defence (MoD) no-fault compensation scheme. This was followed by an opportunity for the participants to clarify any queries via email or during a phone call with a member of the research team. Prospective participants expressing their willingness to join the study were instructed to return the signed consent form at least 24 h after receiving the Participant Information Sheet and associated documents. The study was approved by the UK MoD Research Ethics Committee (MODREC). Supplementary Fig.\nAt the beginning of the first session, participants measured their head circumference at home using the measuring tape provided by the research staff and input the results when prompted on the tablet. The measurement was repeated three times and the average of the three was computed to minimize measurement errors. The participants also completed the Eligibility Questionnaire. In addition, the participants also completed the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, the Mind-Wandering Questionnaire\nDuring all sessions, participants performed the air traffic controller task used by the US Air Force Research Laboratory\nThis task was chosen as a lab-based tool to capture vigilance and cognitive control performance via the detection of rare events, similar to professional operator tasks\nIn a previous lab-based experiment (Malin I. Karstens, unpublished PhD dissertation) using the same task, we found an acceptable test-retest reliability (α = 0.7,\nThe initial session included time for viewing instructions and practicing the task without brain stimulation. In Sessions 2, 3, and 4, participants completed the task with the self-administered neurostimulation using the provided headgear (Supplementary Fig.\nIn Session 1, participants completed a practice period of 12 min consisting of 1 min of slow practice (each stimulus was shown for 3 s, with a 1-second inter-stimulus interval consisting of the radar being shown without the airplanes); 1 min of medium speed (each stimulus was shown for 2 s, with a 1-second inter-stimulus interval consisting of the radar being shown without the airplanes), and 10 min of normal speed (each stimulus was shown for 1 s, with a 1-second inter-stimulus interval consisting of the radar being shown without the airplanes) followed by a baseline session of 10 min. During the practice session, participants received visual feedback for correct and incorrect decisions. In total, Session 1 lasted 30 min and the neurostimulation headgear was not worn during this session. Following the completion of Session 1, participants scheduled the next sessions on a call with the research staff.\nSessions 2-4 lasted approximately 1 h 30 min and were completed within a maximum of one week. The participants completed the air traffic controller task for 20 min (two blocks of 10 min of normal speed trials) without neurostimulation and then for 20 min (two blocks of 10 min of normal speed trials) whilst receiving neurostimulation. We included a break of 1 min between all blocks.\nAlthough the 10-minute task blocks were shorter than real-world attention-demanding activities, this duration optimized participant engagement while maintaining experimental control. Prior research supports the ecological validity of the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), even with a lower number of trials\nBefore each neurostimulation session, participants completed the Neurostimulation Eligibility Questionnaire and four additional questions concerning recent alcohol, caffeine or drug consumption, or lack of sleep. None of the participants reported having drunk more than 3 units of alcohol in the 24 h before the experiment; having drunk alcohol during the day the experiment took place; having had more than one cup of coffee or other sources of caffeine in the hour before the experiment; or having slept less than 6 h the previous night to the experiment.\nSince the neurostimulation was self-administered and monitored remotely, the study participants were supplied with an internet-enabled tablet and a CE-marked tRNS headgear (HomeStim, Neuroelectrics, Barcelona). The internet allowed updating the stimulation protocol onto the tablet prior to the sessions and downloading the study data after the session was finalized but was not used while the neurostimulation was in progress. We delivered the study equipment to participants’ homes and they returned the equipment using fully tracked delivery services (DHL Group, Germany). During the experiment, the participant was required to adhere to certain conditions including:\nSitting position on a chair.\nPlacing the tablet in front of them.\nMinimizing distracting factors such as phones or other people in the same room.\nCompleting the experiment at approximately the same time on 4 different days within a week.\nStable internet connection.\nParticipants received step-by-step instructions on the tablet and during a video call with the research staff on how to position the cap and electrodes, and how to stop the stimulation should they decide to do so at any point. After positioning the cap and electrodes, an impedance check was performed by the device, after which the participant could initiate the neurostimulation via a start button. The battery-driven stimulator delivered the neurostimulation depending on the participant ID code. The neurostimulation parameters could not be changed by the participants, as they were pre-set by the experimenter which limits the intensity and duration of stimulation as well as the frequency of sessions. The stimulation was deactivated until the experimenters set up a single session with a pre-set duration and intensity.\nWe applied a bifrontal electrode montage using the international 10-20 electroencephalography system. One electrode was placed over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, F4) and another electrode was placed over the left DLPFC (F3). The electrodes were inserted in saline-soaked surface sponges (25 cm\nParticipants’ performance and progress were remotely monitored on the research platform to ensure compliance and prompt detection of any issues during testing. Stimulation could not commence unless the correct channels were used. Unlike transcranial direct current stimulation, which requires placement of the anode and cathode for targeted current flow, tRNS is polarity-independent\ntRNS started with a ramp-in phase and ended with a ramp-out phase, lasting 30 s each. The current was administered with an intensity from 0.1 mA up to 1.6 mA between ramp-in/-out, depending on what parameters were chosen by the algorithm. Electrode montage and stimulation parameters, including impedance, were monitored throughout the experiment and were documented automatically. After each stimulation session, the Neurostimulation Side Effects Questionnaire was completed by the participant to record any adverse events. Moreover, before starting a new session, the researchers asked the participants whether they had experienced any side effects since the last session.\nThe primary outcome that the algorithm aimed to optimize was the participants’ non-parametric discrimination index (A’)\nThe primary outcome measure reflected the change in performance and was defined as presented in Eq. (\nTherefore, any ratio above 1 indicates augmented performance. For example, a primary outcome that equals 1.05 reflects a 5% improvement. Any ratio below 1 indicates deteriorated performance.\nOverall, this phase consists of an initial sampling (burn-in) phase of 72 sessions, and a subsequent pBO stage of 218 sessions. The burn-in phase included random stimulation parameters. This burn-in stage enables the algorithm to be trained on participants’ performance on the air traffic controller task as measured by primary outcome. Subsequently, we initiated the pBO stage, where the pBO algorithm was retrained before each stimulation session to determine the optimal parameters for the upcoming session, aiming to enhance task performance as measured by the primary outcome.\nPlease note that the primary aim of this study was to maximize overall sustained attention performance rather than analyze moment-to-moment fluctuations. Therefore, the optimization algorithm was developed using compound scores that distinguish signal from noise (A’) in this detection task.\nLet x denote the parameter to be optimized and p be the personalized variable. In particular, in Experiment 1: we defined the two-dimensional personalized variables p as the Head circumference and the A’ baseline score. We then defined the main variable x (to be optimized) as the Current Intensity. Similarly in Experiment 2: the personalized variable p is defined as two parameters and one main variable x.\nWe define the covariance function (Eq. (\nThe length scale parameters include\nUsing the defined\nUsing the above predictive equations, we define the acquisition function that balances these predictive mean\nNote that this auxiliary maximization problem can be easily optimized by standard numerical techniques.\nWe ran the algorithm in the cloud using Google Cloud Compute Engine with a basic configuration of 2 CPUs and 8 GB of RAM.\nA stopping criterion of 300 data points was set in Experiment 1, based on prior Bayesian optimization studies. Given the potential for increased data variability in human-based research, we set\nOur algorithm took two personalized scores as the input; baseline sustained attention and head circumference. Then, the pBO algorithm suggested the current intensity for the specific session. After a participant completed a session, the A’ from that session was automatically calculated and used as the output score to calculate the outcome—the ratio of improvement (A’ stimulation/A’ baseline)—indicating how well the participant performed. We describe the range of these parameters below based on our data:\n[Input] A’ Baseline [0.3 - 1]\n[Input] Head circumference [52 - 66] cm\n[Input suggested by pBO] Current intensity [0.1,1.6] mA\n[Output] A’ stimulation [0-1]\n[To be maximized] Ratio = A’ stimulation / A’ baseline (Outcome)\nTo compare the performance of our pBO algorithm against the Random Search and non-personalized BO (by merging all users into a *single* user and then performed the same algorithm) methods, we utilized the Ackley function\nWe varied the levels of output noise (\nWe followed the same methods as in Experiment 1, with the following exceptions:\nIn Experiment 3, a total of 35 participants (18 to 35 years old,\nParticipants completed three double-blind conditions on different days in a counterbalanced order, receiving 1) pBO-tRNS according to the algorithm we developed in Experiment 1; 2) sham tRNS; 3) one-size 1.5 mA tRNS. See Supplementary Fig.\nTo ensure an unbiased comparison, the one-size-fits-all tRNS intensity was selected independently of Experiment 1’s findings. Otherwise, selecting intensity based on the algorithm’s output could raise concerns that a literature-based intensity might yield better results than the personalized approach. For a detailed justification of the selection of 1.5 mA tRNS, please refer to the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figs.\nFor sham stimulation, the current was ramped up to 1.5 mA for 30 s and then faded out over another 30 s at the beginning of the first tRNS block. This mimicked real stimulation sensations while preventing active neurostimulation. The headgear montage was identical in all conditions. Participants were unaware of the sham condition, including any differences between the conditions, to minimize expectancy effects\nFor Experiment 3, sample size was determined using G*Power (version 3.1.9.6). To achieve 80% power (1-β = 0.8) at α = 0.05, a paired t-test required 28 participants for a directional hypothesis (tRNS>sham) or 35 participants for a non-directional hypothesis, based on effect size estimates from prior tRNS studies on sustained attention\nTo examine stimulation effects, we used linear mixed effects models, which account for within-subject correlations more optimally compared to ANOVA and handle missing values automatically, allowing maximum use of available data. We used the IBM® SPSS® software platform (version 29.0.1) to perform the linear mixed effects analysis with Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) on the outcome measure, with participants and sessions as the random factors, and stimulation (pBO-tRNS, one-size tRNS, and sham tRNS) as the predictor. In case of a significant result (α = 0.05), we examined the source of this effect by running comparisons between the stimulation conditions. While we do not control for the family-wise error rate, the main result in the manuscript, showing the advantage of pBO-tRNS vs. sham and one-size tRNS, survived the Bonferroni-Holm correction procedure. We confirmed that the residuals are normally distributed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. In one of the analyses, the results from this test were trending (\nWe used a median-split on baseline performance rather than treating it as a continuous covariate, as baseline A’ was included in the primary outcome calculation:\nIt has been shown that the inclusion of baseline performance as a covariate, as in this case, would create a statistical artefact and therefore should be avoided\nGiven the extremely low side effect values (see Supplementary Table\nOne of the main challenges of a remote cognitive experiment, which does not bring an immediate benefit to participants, is that it may lead to a lack of motivation/interest and therefore the data may be unreliable. This aspect is less of a concern when large data is collected as in Experiment 1 (103 participants, total 290 sessions). However, it is a potential concern when baseline performance was used to define the optimal parameters for the personalized intervention (see Fig.\nFurthermore, two additional sham sessions were excluded due to a task crash during the experiment. When the excluded sessions included the sham condition, the complete data from these participants (9.3%) was excluded as it is not possible to assess the advantage of neurostimulation without the sham condition.\nOur work contributes to the United Nations’ SDGs, specifically SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG10 (Reduced Inequalities).

Prospective participants expressing their willingness to join the study were instructed to return the signed consent form at least 24 h after receiving the Participant Information Sheet and associated documents. The study was approved by the UK MoD Research Ethics Committee (MODREC). Supplementary Fig.\nAt the beginning of the first session, participants measured their head circumference at home using the measuring tape provided by the research staff and input the results when prompted on the tablet. The measurement was repeated three times and the average of the three was computed to minimize measurement errors. The participants also completed the Eligibility Questionnaire. In addition, the participants also completed the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, the Mind-Wandering Questionnaire\nDuring all sessions, participants performed the air traffic controller task used by the US Air Force Research Laboratory\nThis task was chosen as a lab-based tool to capture vigilance and cognitive control performance via the detection of rare events, similar to professional operator tasks\nIn a previous lab-based experiment (Malin I. Karstens, unpublished PhD dissertation) using the same task, we found an acceptable test-retest reliability (α = 0.7,\nThe initial session included time for viewing instructions and practicing the task without brain stimulation. In Sessions 2, 3, and 4, participants completed the task with the self-administered neurostimulation using the provided headgear (Supplementary Fig.\nIn Session 1, participants completed a practice period of 12 min consisting of 1 min of slow practice (each stimulus was shown for 3 s, with a 1-second inter-stimulus interval consisting of the radar being shown without the airplanes); 1 min of medium speed (each stimulus was shown for 2 s, with a 1-second inter-stimulus interval consisting of the radar being shown without the airplanes), and 10 min of normal speed (each stimulus was shown for 1 s, with a 1-second inter-stimulus interval consisting of the radar being shown without the airplanes) followed by a baseline session of 10 min. During the practice session, participants received visual feedback for correct and incorrect decisions. In total, Session 1 lasted 30 min and the neurostimulation headgear was not worn during this session. Following the completion of Session 1, participants scheduled the next sessions on a call with the research staff.\nSessions 2-4 lasted approximately 1 h 30 min and were completed within a maximum of one week. The participants completed the air traffic controller task for 20 min (two blocks of 10 min of normal speed trials) without neurostimulation and then for 20 min (two blocks of 10 min of normal speed trials) whilst receiving neurostimulation. We included a break of 1 min between all blocks.\nAlthough the 10-minute task blocks were shorter than real-world attention-demanding activities, this duration optimized participant engagement while maintaining experimental control. Prior research supports the ecological validity of the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), even with a lower number of trials\nBefore each neurostimulation session, participants completed the Neurostimulation Eligibility Questionnaire and four additional questions concerning recent alcohol, caffeine or drug consumption, or lack of sleep. None of the participants reported having drunk more than 3 units of alcohol in the 24 h before the experiment; having drunk alcohol during the day the experiment took place; having had more than one cup of coffee or other sources of caffeine in the hour before the experiment; or having slept less than 6 h the previous night to the experiment.\nSince the neurostimulation was self-administered and monitored remotely, the study participants were supplied with an internet-enabled tablet and a CE-marked tRNS headgear (HomeStim, Neuroelectrics, Barcelona). The internet allowed updating the stimulation protocol onto the tablet prior to the sessions and downloading the study data after the session was finalized but was not used while the neurostimulation was in progress. We delivered the study equipment to participants’ homes and they returned the equipment using fully tracked delivery services (DHL Group, Germany). During the experiment, the participant was required to adhere to certain conditions including:\nSitting position on a chair.\nPlacing the tablet in front of them.\nMinimizing distracting factors such as phones or other people in the same room.\nCompleting the experiment at approximately the same time on 4 different days within a week.\nStable internet connection.\nParticipants received step-by-step instructions on the tablet and during a video call with the research staff on how to position the cap and electrodes, and how to stop the stimulation should they decide to do so at any point. After positioning the cap and electrodes, an impedance check was performed by the device, after which the participant could initiate the neurostimulation via a start button. The battery-driven stimulator delivered the neurostimulation depending on the participant ID code. The neurostimulation parameters could not be changed by the participants, as they were pre-set by the experimenter which limits the intensity and duration of stimulation as well as the frequency of sessions. The stimulation was deactivated until the experimenters set up a single session with a pre-set duration and intensity.\nWe applied a bifrontal electrode montage using the international 10-20 electroencephalography system. One electrode was placed over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, F4) and another electrode was placed over the left DLPFC (F3). The electrodes were inserted in saline-soaked surface sponges (25 cm\nParticipants’ performance and progress were remotely monitored on the research platform to ensure compliance and prompt detection of any issues during testing. Stimulation could not commence unless the correct channels were used. Unlike transcranial direct current stimulation, which requires placement of the anode and cathode for targeted current flow, tRNS is polarity-independent\ntRNS started with a ramp-in phase and ended with a ramp-out phase, lasting 30 s each. The current was administered with an intensity from 0.1 mA up to 1.6 mA between ramp-in/-out, depending on what parameters were chosen by the algorithm. Electrode montage and stimulation parameters, including impedance, were monitored throughout the experiment and were documented automatically. After each stimulation session, the Neurostimulation Side Effects Questionnaire was completed by the participant to record any adverse events. Moreover, before starting a new session, the researchers asked the participants whether they had experienced any side effects since the last session.\nThe primary outcome that the algorithm aimed to optimize was the participants’ non-parametric discrimination index (A’)\nThe primary outcome measure reflected the change in performance and was defined as presented in Eq. (\nTherefore, any ratio above 1 indicates augmented performance. For example, a primary outcome that equals 1.05 reflects a 5% improvement. Any ratio below 1 indicates deteriorated performance.\nOverall, this phase consists of an initial sampling (burn-in) phase of 72 sessions, and a subsequent pBO stage of 218 sessions. The burn-in phase included random stimulation parameters. This burn-in stage enables the algorithm to be trained on participants’ performance on the air traffic controller task as measured by primary outcome. Subsequently, we initiated the pBO stage, where the pBO algorithm was retrained before each stimulation session to determine the optimal parameters for the upcoming session, aiming to enhance task performance as measured by the primary outcome.\nPlease note that the primary aim of this study was to maximize overall sustained attention performance rather than analyze moment-to-moment fluctuations. Therefore, the optimization algorithm was developed using compound scores that distinguish signal from noise (A’) in this detection task.\nLet x denote the parameter to be optimized and p be the personalized variable. In particular, in Experiment 1: we defined the two-dimensional personalized variables p as the Head circumference and the A’ baseline score. We then defined the main variable x (to be optimized) as the Current Intensity. Similarly in Experiment 2: the personalized variable p is defined as two parameters and one main variable x.\nWe define the covariance function (Eq. (\nThe length scale parameters include\nUsing the defined\nUsing the above predictive equations, we define the acquisition function that balances these predictive mean\nNote that this auxiliary maximization problem can be easily optimized by standard numerical techniques.\nWe ran the algorithm in the cloud using Google Cloud Compute Engine with a basic configuration of 2 CPUs and 8 GB of RAM.\nA stopping criterion of 300 data points was set in Experiment 1, based on prior Bayesian optimization studies. Given the potential for increased data variability in human-based research, we set\nOur algorithm took two personalized scores as the input; baseline sustained attention and head circumference. Then, the pBO algorithm suggested the current intensity for the specific session. After a participant completed a session, the A’ from that session was automatically calculated and used as the output score to calculate the outcome—the ratio of improvement (A’ stimulation/A’ baseline)—indicating how well the participant performed. We describe the range of these parameters below based on our data:\n[Input] A’ Baseline [0.3 - 1]\n[Input] Head circumference [52 - 66] cm\n[Input suggested by pBO] Current intensity [0.1,1.6] mA\n[Output] A’ stimulation [0-1]\n[To be maximized] Ratio = A’ stimulation / A’ baseline (Outcome)\nTo compare the performance of our pBO algorithm against the Random Search and non-personalized BO (by merging all users into a *single* user and then performed the same algorithm) methods, we utilized the Ackley function\nWe varied the levels of output noise (\nWe followed the same methods as in Experiment 1, with the following exceptions:\nIn Experiment 3, a total of 35 participants (18 to 35 years old,\nParticipants completed three double-blind conditions on different days in a counterbalanced order, receiving 1) pBO-tRNS according to the algorithm we developed in Experiment 1; 2) sham tRNS; 3) one-size 1.5 mA tRNS. See Supplementary Fig.\nTo ensure an unbiased comparison, the one-size-fits-all tRNS intensity was selected independently of Experiment 1’s findings. Otherwise, selecting intensity based on the algorithm’s output could raise concerns that a literature-based intensity might yield better results than the personalized approach. For a detailed justification of the selection of 1.5 mA tRNS, please refer to the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figs.\nFor sham stimulation, the current was ramped up to 1.5 mA for 30 s and then faded out over another 30 s at the beginning of the first tRNS block. This mimicked real stimulation sensations while preventing active neurostimulation. The headgear montage was identical in all conditions. Participants were unaware of the sham condition, including any differences between the conditions, to minimize expectancy effects\nFor Experiment 3, sample size was determined using G*Power (version 3.1.9.6). To achieve 80% power (1-β = 0.8) at α = 0.05, a paired t-test required 28 participants for a directional hypothesis (tRNS>sham) or 35 participants for a non-directional hypothesis, based on effect size estimates from prior tRNS studies on sustained attention\nTo examine stimulation effects, we used linear mixed effects models, which account for within-subject correlations more optimally compared to ANOVA and handle missing values automatically, allowing maximum use of available data. We used the IBM® SPSS® software platform (version 29.0.1) to perform the linear mixed effects analysis with Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) on the outcome measure, with participants and sessions as the random factors, and stimulation (pBO-tRNS, one-size tRNS, and sham tRNS) as the predictor. In case of a significant result (α = 0.05), we examined the source of this effect by running comparisons between the stimulation conditions. While we do not control for the family-wise error rate, the main result in the manuscript, showing the advantage of pBO-tRNS vs. sham and one-size tRNS, survived the Bonferroni-Holm correction procedure. We confirmed that the residuals are normally distributed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. In one of the analyses, the results from this test were trending (\nWe used a median-split on baseline performance rather than treating it as a continuous covariate, as baseline A’ was included in the primary outcome calculation:\nIt has been shown that the inclusion of baseline performance as a covariate, as in this case, would create a statistical artefact and therefore should be avoided\nGiven the extremely low side effect values (see Supplementary Table\nOne of the main challenges of a remote cognitive experiment, which does not bring an immediate benefit to participants, is that it may lead to a lack of motivation/interest and therefore the data may be unreliable. This aspect is less of a concern when large data is collected as in Experiment 1 (103 participants, total 290 sessions). However, it is a potential concern when baseline performance was used to define the optimal parameters for the personalized intervention (see Fig.\nFurthermore, two additional sham sessions were excluded due to a task crash during the experiment. When the excluded sessions included the sham condition, the complete data from these participants (9.3%) was excluded as it is not possible to assess the advantage of neurostimulation without the sham condition.\nOur work contributes to the United Nations’ SDGs, specifically SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG10 (Reduced Inequalities). By advancing a personalized, home-based neurostimulation system, this research promotes mental health and cognitive well-being (SDG3) while addressing critical barriers to accessibility and scalability. The inclusion of an AI-driven, adaptive framework ensures that effective interventions can be tailored to individual needs, including those with lower baseline abilities, thereby fostering equity in cognitive enhancement. This focus on supporting individuals with suboptimal performance aligns with the goal of reducing inequalities in health outcomes and cognitive capabilities (SDG10), offering a pathway for widespread, scalable implementation that benefits diverse populations.\n\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary Movies 1", "topic": "Social_neurology"}

Recently, exercise serving as automatic emotion regulation has been observed to induce the altered activation of amygdala associated with mood change. However, the specific role of subregions of amygdala underlying these effects are not fully understood. By using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), this study examined whether the subregions of amygdala play distinct roles in mood improvement induced by acute exercise.\nParticipants (\nResults revealed that exercise-induced mood improvements were correlated with significant Group × Time interaction effects on FC, showing a notable right-hemispheric predominance. Specifically, enhanced connectivity of the right mAmyg with orbitofrontal cortex, parietal, and cerebellar regions was associated with reduced negative affect and increased self-esteem. Concurrently, enhanced connectivity of the right lAmyg with the orbitofrontal cortex and striatum was linked to a broad spectrum of improvements, including reduced tension and anger, and increased vigor.\nThese findings suggest that acute exercise improves mood via distinct, lateralized neural pathways centered on different amygdala subregions. The mAmyg and lAmyg play complementary roles in automatic emotion regulation, with the right mAmyg modulating affective valence and self-evaluation, while the right lAmyg appears to regulate a broad spectrum of mood states and enhance positive arousal.

Existing literature have partly identified several brain regions and functional networks influenced by acute exercise. Key brain regions involved include the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (\nThe amygdala, an almond-shaped structure deep within the temporal lobe, assumes responsibility for emotional regulation, implicit emotional learning, emotions-related attention and emotion perception (\nWhile current research has explored the neural mechanisms underlying the altered mood induced by acute aerobic exercise, the specific role of lateral and medial amygdala in this process has not yet been investigated. Furthermore, existing studies have some limitations such as relatively small sample sizes and gender homogeneity in some cases. Therefore, this study aims to utilize resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to investigate the functional connectivity (FC) patterns of the amygdala with other brain regions in a larger and more diverse sample following a moderate-intensity acute aerobic exercise intervention. By comparing FC differences between the basolateral and medial amygdala and other brain regions, this study seeks to elucidate the distinct contributions of these amygdala subregions to the neural mechanisms underlying exercise-induced mood changes.\nEighty-three college students aged 18–22 years were recruited for the present study.

The exercise protocol commenced with a 5-minute warm-up phase, succeeded by 20 min of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at a controlled work rate and 5-minute cool-down phase. During 20-min exercise phase, the average pedaling rate was maintained at 77 ± 4 rpm. Following the exercise period, a five-minute cool-down phase was implemented, during which participants gradually reduced their pedaling rate and workload to slow down their heart rate and breathing.\nThe warm-up phase was initiated at a workload corresponding to 60 % of participants' APMHR, approximately yielding a power output of 25 W and a pedaling rate of 50 rpm. The workload was progressively augmented until the exercise intensity reached 60–69 % of the APMHR, as reflected by an average pedaling rate of 77 ± 4 rpm. Throughout the intervention, HR, RPE scales, power output in watts, and revolutions per minute were monitored at 2-minute intervals. After the exercise intervention, participants were instructed to rest until their HR reverted to baseline levels. Only once this criterion was met, the post-test session MRI scan was conducted, ensuring completion within a 10-minute timeframe.\nIn the control group, participants were tasked with engaging in a 30-minute session of reading neutral textual material without causing mood swings, conducted within a noise-free environment. Throughout this duration, their heart rate was monitored. Notably, the use of cell phones was strictly prohibited during this period.\nAll neuroimaging data were acquired using the Siemens 3T Trio system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The functional images of resting states were obtained using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence, employing the following scanning parameters: Repetition Time (TR) = 2000 ms, Echo Time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle (FA) = 90°, slice thickness = 3.0 mm, field of view (FOV) = 200×200 mm\nFor data preprocessing and analysis, the Data Processing & Analysis for Brain Imaging (DPABI) toolbox was employed (\nROIs were selected from the Brainnetome Atlas, a template that divides the entire brain into 246 subregions based on brain structure and connectivity (\nTo specifically assess the impact of the acute exercise intervention on the change in resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC), a whole-brain, voxel-wise mixed-effect analysis was performed for each of the four predefined amygdala subregion ROIs. This analysis was conducted using the mixed-effect analysis module within the DPABI toolbox. For each seed ROI, a model was constructed with FC as the dependent variable. The model included a between-subject factor of Group (Aerobic Exercise vs. Control), a within-subject factor of Time (Pre- vs. Post-intervention), and crucially, the Group × Time interaction term. Our primary analysis focused on the statistical map of this interaction, which identifies brain regions where the change in FC from pre- to post-intervention differed significantly between the two groups. To control for potential artifacts arising from head motion, a critical source of variance in rs-fMRI, the mean Framewise Displacement (FD) value from each scan was included as a time-varying covariate of no interest in the model. The resulting statistical maps for the Group × Time interaction were corrected for multiple comparisons using Gaussian Random Field (GRF) theory. The significance thresholds were set at a voxel-level\nStatistical analyses for demographic and behavioral data were performed using SPSS (Social Science Statistical Package) version 26.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

In these models, the respective baseline mood score for each dimension, along with age, gender, BMI, and PARS-3 scores, were included as covariates.\nWithin the exercise group (AG), Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to explore the relationship between significant changes in functional connectivity (ΔFC values from brain regions showing significant group differences in the fMRI analysis) and changes in mood scores (ΔMood from PANAS and A-POMS, calculated as post-intervention minus pre-intervention scores).\nBaseline data analysis on mood revealed no significant intergroup differences in other emotions except for the positive affect dimension of PANAS and the vigor dimension of A-POMS, where the AG group scored significantly higher than the CG group (see Table S1).\nGEE analysis revealed significant time main effects in scores for the NA of PANAS, and all dimensions of A-POMS (\nMood questionnaire scores before and after acute aerobic exercise.\nAbbreviations: PA, positive affect; NA, negative affect; TMD, Total Mood Disturbance, the total score of Abbreviated Profile of Mood State scale.\nGEE analysis results of the influence of exercise on emotion.\nTo further validate the robustness of our findings and to account for potential baseline differences that might confound the intervention effects, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using a covariance analysis (ANCOVA). In addition to age, gender, BMI, and physical activity level, we included baseline mood scores as covariates in the model to examine the group differences in post-intervention mood scores. The results revealed that the group difference for esteem (\nThe whole-brain, ROI-to-voxel analysis revealed significant Group × Time interaction effects on functional connectivity for all four amygdala subregion seeds (See\nSpecifically, acute exercise enhanced the left medial amygdala's (mAmyg) connectivity with right superior parietal lobule (SPL) and Heschl's gyrus. For the right mAmyg, the intervention strengthened its FC with multiple large clusters, including the bilateral middle and inferior frontal gyrus, left OFC, left cerebellum (Crus II), right SPL and middle occipital gyrus (MOG). For the left lateral amygdala (lAmyg), we observed significantly increased ∆FC with clusters in the cerebellum (lobules VI, VII, VIII, IX). Finally, the right lateral amygdala (R lAmyg) showed greater increases in ∆FC with the right medial OFC and the left caudate/nucleus accumbens (NAc).\nTo explore the clinical significance of these neural changes, we correlated the ∆FC values with changes in mood scores within the acute aerobic exercise group (\nCorrelation analysis of emotional changes and functional connectivity changes in acute aerobic exercise group. Each panel displays a significant correlation found within the aerobic exercise group (\nThe enhanced connectivity of the left mAmyg with the right SPL was associated with a greater reduction in Negative Affect (\nSimilarly, enhanced connectivity from the right mAmyg to several regions was also linked to greater reductions in Negative Affect. These regions included the left OFC (\nThe right lAmyg showed associations with a particularly diverse range of mood dimensions. Enhanced connectivity between the right lAmyg and the right OFC was related to decreases across four negative indices: Negative Affect (\nTo our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to investigate the distinct roles of amygdala subregions in mood improvements following a single bout of acute aerobic exercise in a large sample of young adults (the published database: doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.14222 (\nFirstly, this study has uncovered the critical role of right amygdala-OFC circuits in mediating the mood-enhancing effects of exercise, revealing distinct contributions from medial and lateral subregions. The observed enhancement of amygdala-OFC connectivity is broadly in line with previous work (\nA notable finding of this study was the elucidation of the neural mechanisms underlying the increase in exercise-induced vigor. Vigor is conceptualized not merely as a simple positive mood, but as a multifaceted state of positive arousal encompassing feelings of physical strength, emotional energy, and cognitive liveliness (\nThis study also revealed that acute aerobic exercise led to enhanced FC between the bilateral medial amygdala and the right SPL. And this enhancement was associated with decreases in negative emotion. The SPL are generally associated with functions such as selective attention and working memory, and the control network and dorsal attention network containing it play roles in reallocating attention during emotion regulation and emotion control (\nOur study found that acute exercise significantly enhanced self-esteem, a key behavioral outcome that aligns with a large body of research showing the capacity of exercise to bolster positive affective states (\nA striking pattern that emerged from our findings is the pronounced right-hemisphere lateralization of exercise-induced changes in amygdala connectivity. While we observed significant effects originating from both left and right subregions, the most extensive and diverse associations with mood improvement were linked to the right medial and right lateral amygdala. This observation aligns with a body of literature suggesting a specialized role for the right amygdala in the processing of emotionally salient stimuli and the automatic generation of affective states (\nIt is important to acknowledge several limitations in this study. Firstly, the current investigation only examined the effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on emotions. Previous research has indicated that high-intensity exercise might have a more pronounced impact on emotion improvement, particularly in individuals with high levels of anxiety (\nIn conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence that acute aerobic exercise improves mood by engaging distinct and lateralized neural circuits centered on different amygdala subregions. Our findings converge on a unifying theme: acute aerobic exercise appears to function as a potent form of automatic emotion regulation. This form of regulation, as delineated by\nSpecifically, we identified several potential pathways underlying these benefits. These include: (1) enhanced top-down regulation of negative affect via OFC-amygdala circuits; (2) improved attentional resource allocation through parietal-amygdala pathways; (3) modulation of self-evaluative emotions like self-esteem via cerebellar-amygdala connections; and (4) a boost in motivation and reward processing related to feelings of vigor through striatal-amygdala pathways.\nFuture research should further validate the roles of these distinct processes in exercise-induced mood improvement. It is essential to explore the interplay between top-down automatic emotion regulation, attentional shifting, self-evaluation, and the motivational effects of engaging the brain's reward circuitry. Understanding how these specific amygdala-based pathways contribute to well-being will be crucial for developing more targeted and effective exercise-based interventions for emotional disorders.\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.", "content_for_embedding": "Emotion regulation refers to an individual’s ability to influence emotions in oneself by activating a goal to modify the emotion-generating process (\nAcute aerobic exercise has immediate and short-term effects on mood, by reducing negative mood such as anxiety, depression, tension, and anger (\nAn increasing number of studies have focused on exploring the neural mechanisms underlying the mood change associated with acute aerobic exercise.

In these models, the respective baseline mood score for each dimension, along with age, gender, BMI, and PARS-3 scores, were included as covariates.\nWithin the exercise group (AG), Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to explore the relationship between significant changes in functional connectivity (ΔFC values from brain regions showing significant group differences in the fMRI analysis) and changes in mood scores (ΔMood from PANAS and A-POMS, calculated as post-intervention minus pre-intervention scores).\nBaseline data analysis on mood revealed no significant intergroup differences in other emotions except for the positive affect dimension of PANAS and the vigor dimension of A-POMS, where the AG group scored significantly higher than the CG group (see Table S1).\nGEE analysis revealed significant time main effects in scores for the NA of PANAS, and all dimensions of A-POMS (\nMood questionnaire scores before and after acute aerobic exercise.\nAbbreviations: PA, positive affect; NA, negative affect; TMD, Total Mood Disturbance, the total score of Abbreviated Profile of Mood State scale.\nGEE analysis results of the influence of exercise on emotion.\nTo further validate the robustness of our findings and to account for potential baseline differences that might confound the intervention effects, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using a covariance analysis (ANCOVA). In addition to age, gender, BMI, and physical activity level, we included baseline mood scores as covariates in the model to examine the group differences in post-intervention mood scores. The results revealed that the group difference for esteem (\nThe whole-brain, ROI-to-voxel analysis revealed significant Group × Time interaction effects on functional connectivity for all four amygdala subregion seeds (See\nSpecifically, acute exercise enhanced the left medial amygdala's (mAmyg) connectivity with right superior parietal lobule (SPL) and Heschl's gyrus. For the right mAmyg, the intervention strengthened its FC with multiple large clusters, including the bilateral middle and inferior frontal gyrus, left OFC, left cerebellum (Crus II), right SPL and middle occipital gyrus (MOG). For the left lateral amygdala (lAmyg), we observed significantly increased ∆FC with clusters in the cerebellum (lobules VI, VII, VIII, IX). Finally, the right lateral amygdala (R lAmyg) showed greater increases in ∆FC with the right medial OFC and the left caudate/nucleus accumbens (NAc).\nTo explore the clinical significance of these neural changes, we correlated the ∆FC values with changes in mood scores within the acute aerobic exercise group (\nCorrelation analysis of emotional changes and functional connectivity changes in acute aerobic exercise group. Each panel displays a significant correlation found within the aerobic exercise group (\nThe enhanced connectivity of the left mAmyg with the right SPL was associated with a greater reduction in Negative Affect (\nSimilarly, enhanced connectivity from the right mAmyg to several regions was also linked to greater reductions in Negative Affect. These regions included the left OFC (\nThe right lAmyg showed associations with a particularly diverse range of mood dimensions. Enhanced connectivity between the right lAmyg and the right OFC was related to decreases across four negative indices: Negative Affect (\nTo our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to investigate the distinct roles of amygdala subregions in mood improvements following a single bout of acute aerobic exercise in a large sample of young adults (the published database: doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.14222 (\nFirstly, this study has uncovered the critical role of right amygdala-OFC circuits in mediating the mood-enhancing effects of exercise, revealing distinct contributions from medial and lateral subregions. The observed enhancement of amygdala-OFC connectivity is broadly in line with previous work (\nA notable finding of this study was the elucidation of the neural mechanisms underlying the increase in exercise-induced vigor. Vigor is conceptualized not merely as a simple positive mood, but as a multifaceted state of positive arousal encompassing feelings of physical strength, emotional energy, and cognitive liveliness (\nThis study also revealed that acute aerobic exercise led to enhanced FC between the bilateral medial amygdala and the right SPL. And this enhancement was associated with decreases in negative emotion. The SPL are generally associated with functions such as selective attention and working memory, and the control network and dorsal attention network containing it play roles in reallocating attention during emotion regulation and emotion control (\nOur study found that acute exercise significantly enhanced self-esteem, a key behavioral outcome that aligns with a large body of research showing the capacity of exercise to bolster positive affective states (\nA striking pattern that emerged from our findings is the pronounced right-hemisphere lateralization of exercise-induced changes in amygdala connectivity. While we observed significant effects originating from both left and right subregions, the most extensive and diverse associations with mood improvement were linked to the right medial and right lateral amygdala. This observation aligns with a body of literature suggesting a specialized role for the right amygdala in the processing of emotionally salient stimuli and the automatic generation of affective states (\nIt is important to acknowledge several limitations in this study. Firstly, the current investigation only examined the effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on emotions. Previous research has indicated that high-intensity exercise might have a more pronounced impact on emotion improvement, particularly in individuals with high levels of anxiety (\nIn conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence that acute aerobic exercise improves mood by engaging distinct and lateralized neural circuits centered on different amygdala subregions. Our findings converge on a unifying theme: acute aerobic exercise appears to function as a potent form of automatic emotion regulation. This form of regulation, as delineated by\nSpecifically, we identified several potential pathways underlying these benefits. These include: (1) enhanced top-down regulation of negative affect via OFC-amygdala circuits; (2) improved attentional resource allocation through parietal-amygdala pathways; (3) modulation of self-evaluative emotions like self-esteem via cerebellar-amygdala connections; and (4) a boost in motivation and reward processing related to feelings of vigor through striatal-amygdala pathways.\nFuture research should further validate the roles of these distinct processes in exercise-induced mood improvement. It is essential to explore the interplay between top-down automatic emotion regulation, attentional shifting, self-evaluation, and the motivational effects of engaging the brain's reward circuitry. Understanding how these specific amygdala-based pathways contribute to well-being will be crucial for developing more targeted and effective exercise-based interventions for emotional disorders.\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.", "topic": "Social_neurology"}

Furthermore, a qualified specimen originated from a patient with clinical symptoms and signs consistent with pneumonia, and new, persistent, or worsening pulmonary exudates, infiltrates, or consolidations are observed on imaging. Patients receiving antimicrobial treatment who initially improved but then worsened, with a timing consistent with the appearance of pathogens, were included. Sputum cultures showing pathogen growth or predominant growth on two or more occasions were included. Moreover, biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were beneficial supplements for clinical diagnosis.\nThe following data were retrospectively collected: patient data, including (1) demographic information, on sex and age; (2) underlying diseases, such as smoking history, alcohol history, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, and number of underlying diseases; (3) admission status, such as transfer from another hospital, multiple injuries, chest trauma, coma, temperature, heart rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS); (4) early hospitalization laboratory results, such as creatinine clearance rate(CCR), albumin, hemoglobin, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR); (5) medication status, such as the combination of antibacterial drugs, days of antibacterial drug use, proton pump inhibitors, and glucocorticoids; and (6) other data, such as external ventricular drainage, surgical history, blood transfusion, urinary catheter, gastric tube, tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation time, and days of hospitalization before infection.

However, when deciding whether to combine antimicrobial drugs, we need to exercise caution, and the combination regimen should be based more on high-quality evidence from evidence-based medicine. For example, a study revealed that in the treatment of pneumonia caused by MRSA and MDRPA, combination therapy did not significantly differ from monotherapy in terms of cure rates and instead increased the resistance of pathogens.\nMost neurosurgical patients have respiratory dysfunction, and to ensure airway patency, tracheostomy is often required to maintain effective breathing. Tracheostomy is an invasive procedure that directly exposes the airway mucosa to the air, resulting in the loss of the body’s natural defense functions, such as filtration and humidification.\nThis study has the following advantages: First, we propose for the first time that ARC is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of MDR pneumonia in neurosurgical patients, and we provide a reasonable explanation for this finding. Given the high incidence of ACR in neurosurgical wards, this topic should receive significant attention from clinicians. Second, this research provides a convenient and practical quantitative prediction tool that is based on six predictive factors, which are all essential clinical indicators. These indicators are easy to test and cost effective and do not impose additional medical expenses on patients during hospitalization. Finally, our nomogram has been extensively validated, demonstrating good discrimination, calibration, and strong clinical applicability and stability.\nHowever, this study also has certain limitations: It is a retrospective record of patient information from a single center over nearly four years and did not use external data for validation. Therefore, its generalizability to other populations may be limited. In the future, it will be necessary to incorporate multi-center, large-sample external datasets to more comprehensively evaluate the robustness of the model.\nOverall, our nomogram includes six predictive factors: ARC, the Day 1 NLR, hypoproteinemia, hemoglobin, the combination of antibacterial drugs, and tracheostomy, which can predict the occurrence of MDR pneumonia in neurosurgical patients early during hospitalization. Based on the predictive results, adjustments can be made to the antimicrobial drug administration regimen, nutritional support, and clinical care. Moreover, early pulmonary pathogen testing can be conducted to accelerate the transition from empirical treatment to targeted therapy, thereby improving patient management.

Therefore, we continued to investigate the potential effect of microbiome alteration by the two antibiotics ampicillin (a ß-lactam) and kanamycin (a non-ß-lactam). Metagenomic analysis indicated that antibiotic treatment reduced the diversity and quantity of detectable bacterial populations in treated planarians. We therefore proceeded to test the potential effect of microbiome alteration on abstinence-induced nicotine withdrawal in an established planarian model [\nPlanarians that were pretreated in APW and then tested in APW without ampicillin displayed a normal motility velocity, a control that indicates that there was no change in normal activity over the observation period. Planarians that were pretreated in APW and then tested in APW with kanamycin displayed a normal motility velocity, a control that indicates that kanamycin did not alter normal activity over the observation period. Planarians that were pretreated in APW and then tested in APW with kanamycin displayed a normal motility velocity, a control that indicates that kanamycin did not alter normal activity over the observation period. Planarians that were pretreated in APW and then tested in APW containing ampicillin plus kanamycin displayed normal motility velocity, a control that indicates that a combination of ampicillin plus kanamycin did not alter normal activity over the observation period. There was no significant difference among these control groups, so we proceeded. Planarians that were pretreated with nicotine and then tested in APW without antibiotics displayed a significant reduction in motility, a finding that extensive previous work has demonstrated is a rigorous model of abstinence-induced withdrawal in the planarian model [\nTaken together, the results indicate that a ß-lactam broad-spectrum antibiotic (ampicillin) prevents abstinence-induced withdrawal from nicotine, but a non-ß-lactam broad-spectrum antibiotic (kanamycin) does not. It is unclear why the combination did not have an effect. One possibility is that the combination effectively gave the worms a double dose of antibiotic, effectively antagonizing ampicillin’s effect. Note that this does not reflect on clinical activity; it only reports the findings of nicotine withdrawal using the protocol of this test system.\nIn retrospect, there is a possible prior indication in the literature that antibiotics can affect the withdrawal behavior in planarians. Specifically, Rawls et al. [\nThe current study has limitations. Although we attribute the effect of ampicillin on alleviating nicotine withdrawal to changes in the microbiome, it has not conclusively been proven. Further study is required to determine if changes in microbiome alone, transporters, or some combination of the two result in behavioral changes after only one hour versus a week of exposure. Other limitations include small sample sizes, potential confounding effects, and follow-up that specific bands of DNA are GC-rich with molecular evidence (e.g., sequencing or composition analysis). Hopefully, future work will address these gaps to strengthen generalizability.\nThis study aimed to determine if microbiome alteration using antibiotics modulates nicotine withdrawal behavior in planarians.

To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature search of studies published before October 2024 using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We included original research articles and review papers investigating m6A methylation in the central nervous system and its association with mental disorders, based on human, animal, or cellular models. Articles were selected for their scientific relevance, methodological rigor, and novelty. Given the high prevalence of certain psychiatric conditions and the extent of related m6A research, this review focuses specifically on depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and substance addiction.\nThe m6A methylation modification is a dynamic and reversible process regulated by 3 core groups of factors: methyltransferases (“writers”), demethylases (“erasers”), and reader proteins (“readers”).\nOverview of the m6A RNA modification machinery. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is catalyzed by a multi-component writer complex comprising METTL3, METTL14, METTL16, WTAP, VIRMA (KIAA1429), RBM15/15B, and ZC3H13. These methyltransferases install m6A modifications on mRNA bases. The modification can be reversed by eraser enzymes such as FTO and ALKBH5, which mediate m6A demethylation. Reader proteins, including YTHDF1/2/3, YTHDC1/2, IGF2BP1/2/3, FMRP, PRRC2A, ELAVL1, eIF3, and HNRNPC/A2B1, recognize and bind to m6A-modified RNA to regulate various post-transcriptional processes, such as mRNA translation, degradation, and microRNA processing.\nThe biological functions of m6A methylation modification span a wide range of physiological processes, including hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, the cell cycle, and RNA metabolism.\nThe m6A modification is essential for nervous system development. The methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 play pivotal roles in neuronal differentiation; their deletion impairs the ability of neural stem cells to differentiate into neurons, disrupting neuronal formation and function.\nThe m6A modification also has effects on oligodendrocyte specialization and myelin formation. By recognizing the GGACU consensus motif in the Olig2-encoding sequence, the reading protein PRRC2A binds and stabilizes Olig2 mRNA in an m6A-dependent mechanism.\nThese findings underscore the diverse functions of m6A modification at various stages of nervous system development, including neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, glial cell maturation, and axonal growth. The dynamic regulation of m6A methylation highlights its critical importance as a fundamental mechanism underlying both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions.\nNeural plasticity, the remarkable ability of the nervous system to adapt to internal and external environmental changes, underpins advanced neural functions such as cognition and emotion. In neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, dysregulation of m6A is closely linked to synaptic protein dysfunction, impairing synaptic plasticity and contributing to deficits in learning and memory.\nIn the hippocampus, m6A methylation affects neural plasticity by modulating the miR-124-C/EBPα-FTO transcriptional axis, which regulates the expression of neural plasticity-related genes, such as\nMoreover, recent studies suggest that physical exercise can mitigate mental disorders by counteracting chronic stress-induced neural dysfunction.\nIn addition to stress factors, exposure to certain chemicals in the environment can also alter the level of m6A modification in neurons, thereby affecting neuroplasticity. For example, exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) results in an increase in m6A levels in hippocampal neurons, along with an upregulation of METTL3 expression. Treatment with STM2457, a selective METTL3 inhibitor, effectively suppresses BPA-induced m6A upregulation and restores normal synaptic transmission, further demonstrating the regulatory role of m6A in chemically induced changes in neural plasticity.\nCollectively, these findings highlight the indispensable role of m6A methylation in both the development and maintenance of neural plasticity. By regulating synaptic plasticity and neural function, m6A serves as a critical link between environmental stimuli, gene expression, and behavioral outcomes. Further investigation into the mechanisms of m6A in neural plasticity will deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of mental disorders, such as depression, and provide a strong theoretical foundation for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.\nStudies have highlighted that m6A modification plays a pivotal role in regulating neurotransmitter systems by modulating the expression of key genes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and receptor signaling. This is particularly evident in the dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems, both of which are closely linked to the pathophysiology of mental disorders.\nThe DA system is crucial for regulating emotions, motivation, and reward-related behaviors.\nFurther research has demonstrated that overexpression of FTO or the inhibition of m6A modification leads to a reduction in m6A levels within the striatum, resulting in decreased DA levels. This alteration in DA signaling may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD, suggesting that m6A could be a potential therapeutic target for DA-related disorders.\nSimilar to the DA system, the 5-HT system is vital for regulating mood, emotion, and behavior. m6A modification has been shown to influence 5-HT levels and neuronal transmission by regulating the expression of genes involved in 5-HT synthesis and metabolism.\nIncreasing evidence suggests that m6A methylation significantly influences the expression of inflammation-related genes and contributes to the development of various inflammation-associated diseases. For instance, FTO modulates the stability of cGAS mRNA by regulating m6A methylation levels, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.\nGiven the close correlation between neuroinflammation and the pathogenesis of mental disorders, as well as the role of m6A methylation in regulating neuroinflammatory processes, m6A methylation offers a promising target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating inflammation-related disorders.\nDepression is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, accompanied by intense feelings of guilt, changes in sleep and appetite, and other symptoms. In severe cases, cognitive dysfunction, abnormal behavior, and even hallucinations and delusions may occur.\nRecent studies have indicated that m6A methylation may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression (\nRoles and mechanisms of m6A modification in various mental disorders.\nPlasma or blood-derived population: *1: Patients with the first episode of schizophrenia (\nResearch on the Han Chinese population has revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the demethylase ALKBH5 may be risk factors for MDD in this group.\nFTO, another demethylase, is significantly downregulated in the hippocampus of both MDD patients and depressive mouse, leading to elevated methylation levels of Adrb2 mRNA. This methylation change mediates the development of depressive-like behaviors via the ADRB2-c-MYC-SIRT1 signaling pathway, which is also closely related to the therapeutic effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine.\nThe m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is highly expressed in CUS-induced depressive rat models, and silencing METTL3 improves cognitive deficits. Specifically, METTL3 mediates the m6A modification of pri-miR-221, promoting its maturation and upregulating miR-221-3p, which inhibits\nAs an important RNA modification, m6A methylation has shown potential as a biomarker in the diagnosis of various diseases, including cancers,\nPreclinical studies have demonstrated that modulating m6A levels can effectively reverse depressive-like behaviors in animal models. For instance, injecting cycloleucine, a compound that reduces m6A methylation by competitively inhibiting methionine adenosyltransferase (the enzyme responsible for synthesizing S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the primary methyl donor for DNA and RNA methylation) into a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors.\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by significant geographical and demographic variations. The incidence rate typically ranges from 0.5% to 1% in various countries and regions, although it may be higher in specific populations.\nResearch has demonstrated that dynamic changes in m6A modification are crucial for regulating neuronal function and are closely associated with the pathological mechanisms of schizophrenia. In the brain tissue of schizophrenia patients, abnormal levels of m6A modification may lead to dysregulated expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment and neuronal function, which subsequently affect neuronal morphology and functionality, potentially contributing to schizophrenia’s onset.\nThe development of schizophrenia is often associated with disrupted synaptic plasticity.\nIn addition to its role in disease onset, m6A modification is also implicated in the response to antipsychotic treatments. Studies have found significant changes in the methylation patterns of both DNA and RNA in schizophrenia patients following conventional drug treatment.\nThrough the analysis of m6A methylation patterns, researchers are gaining a deeper understanding of the biological basis of schizophrenia, thereby providing new approaches for early screening and personalized treatment.\nAutism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication skills, along with repetitive behaviors and restricted interests.\nIntegrated analysis of multi-omics data has revealed that abnormalities in m6A modification are closely linked to the onset of ASD,\nIn recent years, an increasing body of research has suggested that m6A methylation modification may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ASD. Through integrative multi-omics analyses, studies have found that abnormal m6A modification is closely associated with the onset of ASD.\nAnimal models and in vitro cell experiments have also confirmed the involvement of m6A modification in ASD pathogenesis. By manipulating m6A modification levels in cells using gene editing technologies, researchers observed gene expression changes associated with ASD, providing direct evidence for the role of m6A modification in the disorder.\nN6-methyladenosine modification contributes to the pathological process of ASD by regulating key signaling pathways. One critical m6A reader protein, YTHDF1, plays an essential role in axon and dendrite development. YTHDF1 regulates synaptic development and plasticity by promoting the translation of Robo3.1, an axon guidance protein. However, when mutations occur at the m6A modification sites, YTHDF1 loses its ability to regulate Robo3.1 translation, resulting in abnormal synaptic transmission and plasticity, which subsequently impairs memory consolidation.\nMoreover, research has found that in the hippocampal tissue of ASD patients or model mice, the expression of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is significantly downregulated, accompanied by downregulation of long non-coding RNA MALAT1 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while the expression of the inhibitory molecule SFRP2 is upregulated. These changes contribute to the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, exacerbating the pathological process of ASD.\nAbnormal m6A modification in ASD patients exhibits significant molecular characteristics, which could potentially serve as biomarkers for the disorder. By detecting m6A levels in peripheral blood, researchers could identify high-risk individuals for ASD before clinical symptoms appear, facilitating early intervention. Additionally, the combined use of m6A detection with other biomarkers, in conjunction with multi-omics data, could significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of ASD screening.\nCurrent research indicates that targeting m6A methylation regulation may provide new therapeutic strategies for ASD. For example, modulating METTL3 expression levels could repair the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, reduce hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and improve ASD-related behaviors. This highlights the important role of m6A modification in the pathogenesis of ASD and its potential as a therapeutic target. Future large-scale clinical studies and in-depth mechanistic investigations will provide further evidence to support this field.\nDrug addiction is a chronic and relapsing brain disorder, primarily characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, along with a loss of control over drug consumption.\nCocaine is a highly addictive stimulant. Research has shown that in a cocaine-induced mouse conditioned place preference (CPP) experiment, the expression of FTO in the hippocampus was significantly downregulated, while the expression of methyltransferases such as METTL3 and METTL14 did not show significant changes. This suggests that FTO may play a key role in the regulation of cocaine addiction. Further analysis through methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq), a technique that maps m6A-methylated RNA, revealed that the overall m6A modification levels in the hippocampus of cocaine-treated mice were significantly elevated when compared with control group, with changes in m6A peaks primarily involving genes related to glutamatergic synapses, long-term potentiation (LTP), axon guidance, and neuronal function. These findings indicate that the dynamic changes in FTO expression and m6A modification may mediate the onset of cocaine addiction by regulating synaptic maturation and localization.\nIn a separate study using opioids such as oxycodone to induce rewarding behaviors in mice, researchers observed a marked increase in the protein levels of METTL14 and overall m6A modification in striatal neurons. In contrast, the expression of PP1α, a protein phosphatase, was found to decrease. These results suggest a close relationship between m6A methylation and opioid addiction. Further investigation pointed to lncRNA HOTAIR as a potential mediator in this process.\nIn contrast to cocaine addiction, a study on morphine addiction in mice found that neither acute nor chronic morphine exposure significantly altered m6A modification levels or the expression of m6A methyltransferases (such as METTL3) in the brain. This suggests that m6A methylation modification may not be involved in the regulatory process of morphine addiction, or its mechanisms may differ from those involved in other addictive substances.\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is another prevalent form of addiction characterized by compulsive drinking, alcohol craving, increased tolerance, and severe withdrawal symptoms. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region involved in DA-mediated reward and pleasure, has been implicated in the development of alcohol addiction. In a mouse model of long-term alcohol consumption, RNA methylation changes were associated with specific gene expression alterations, leading to enhanced neural adaptation to alcohol. Through epigenomic microarray analysis, researchers identified 26 mRNAs and 4 lncRNAs in the NAc of AUD subjects that were highly methylated, while the methylation level of 3 mRNAs and 1 lncRNA was significantly reduced. These results suggest that m6A methylation may play a role in the neural adaptation processes underlying alcohol addiction. However, these findings need to be replicated in larger sample sizes, and future research should explore whether these changes are gender- or population-specific.\nThis review focused on 4 major psychiatric disorders—depression, schizophrenia, ASD, and drug addiction. Although other conditions such as anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorder also exhibit high prevalence and clinical importance, current research on m6A modification in these disorders remains limited. This gap underscores the need for future investigations, which may contribute to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets across a broader range of psychiatric conditions.\nThrough an integrated analysis of m6A modifications in the aforementioned disorders, we found that several key m6A-regulating enzymes, such as METTL3, ALKBH5, and FTO, exhibit similar patterns of dysregulation across different mental illnesses. Moreover, these enzymes are primarily involved in the onset and progression of psychiatric disorders by modulating similar processes, including neuroinflammation, neurodevelopment, and synaptic plasticity. These parallels not only reflect the presence of shared pathogenic mechanisms among various mental disorders but also underscore the indispensable role of m6A regulatory enzymes in initiating epitranscriptomic alterations that contribute to disease development.\nNevertheless, it is important to recognize that, although current studies on m6A modification in mental disorders remain limited, distinct brain region- or cell types-specific differences have been observed in the patterns of m6A modification and the expression of its regulatory enzymes across different psychiatric conditions. The specific RNAs undergoing m6A modification, as well as the downstream signaling pathways they modulate, also vary widely. Therefore, further elucidation of the downstream molecular networks governed by m6A modification is critically needed.\nLooking forward, this complexity poses an important question for therapeutic development: should strategies targeting m6A pathways adopt a broad-spectrum approach, or be tailored specifically to the molecular landscape of each disorder? Addressing this question will be essential for translating m6A-related findings into clinically meaningful interventions.\nFurthermore, the emergence of single-cell sequencing technologies provides new opportunities to investigate m6A methylation dynamics at high resolution. Future studies leveraging these approaches will enhance our understanding of m6A functions in distinct neuronal subtypes and disease-relevant cellular contexts.\nFinally, the development of small-molecule modulators—such as agonists or antagonists of m6A-associated proteins—holds great promise for therapeutic innovation. Such tools may enable precision medicine approaches tailored to individual molecular profiles. Continued research in this direction will not only deepen our understanding of m6A biology but also advance the design of effective, targeted treatments for psychiatric disorders.", "content_for_embedding": "Epigenetic modifications are heritable changes in gene expression driven by environmental factors or intracellular mechanisms that do not alter the DNA sequence.\nMental illnesses represent a significant global challenge, imposing substantial burdens on individuals, society, and economies.\nThe m6A modification is crucial for the normal development and physiological functioning of the nervous system, including its roles in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, synaptic transmission, and the cognitive function.\nGenetic loci regulating m6A levels as quantitative traits (m6A quantitative trait loci, or m6A-QTLs) have been identified in various human tissues, including the brain.\nIn this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying m6A methylation, its roles in psychiatric disorders, and its emerging potential as a therapeutic target. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature search of studies published before October 2024 using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We included original research articles and review papers investigating m6A methylation in the central nervous system and its association with mental disorders, based on human, animal, or cellular models. Articles were selected for their scientific relevance, methodological rigor, and novelty. Given the high prevalence of certain psychiatric conditions and the extent of related m6A research, this review focuses specifically on depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and substance addiction.\nThe m6A methylation modification is a dynamic and reversible process regulated by 3 core groups of factors: methyltransferases (“writers”), demethylases (“erasers”), and reader proteins (“readers”).\nOverview of the m6A RNA modification machinery. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is catalyzed by a multi-component writer complex comprising METTL3, METTL14, METTL16, WTAP, VIRMA (KIAA1429), RBM15/15B, and ZC3H13. These methyltransferases install m6A modifications on mRNA bases. The modification can be reversed by eraser enzymes such as FTO and ALKBH5, which mediate m6A demethylation. Reader proteins, including YTHDF1/2/3, YTHDC1/2, IGF2BP1/2/3, FMRP, PRRC2A, ELAVL1, eIF3, and HNRNPC/A2B1, recognize and bind to m6A-modified RNA to regulate various post-transcriptional processes, such as mRNA translation, degradation, and microRNA processing.\nThe biological functions of m6A methylation modification span a wide range of physiological processes, including hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, the cell cycle, and RNA metabolism.\nThe m6A modification is essential for nervous system development. The methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 play pivotal roles in neuronal differentiation; their deletion impairs the ability of neural stem cells to differentiate into neurons, disrupting neuronal formation and function.\nThe m6A modification also has effects on oligodendrocyte specialization and myelin formation. By recognizing the GGACU consensus motif in the Olig2-encoding sequence, the reading protein PRRC2A binds and stabilizes Olig2 mRNA in an m6A-dependent mechanism.\nThese findings underscore the diverse functions of m6A modification at various stages of nervous system development, including neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, glial cell maturation, and axonal growth. The dynamic regulation of m6A methylation highlights its critical importance as a fundamental mechanism underlying both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions.\nNeural plasticity, the remarkable ability of the nervous system to adapt to internal and external environmental changes, underpins advanced neural functions such as cognition and emotion. In neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, dysregulation of m6A is closely linked to synaptic protein dysfunction, impairing synaptic plasticity and contributing to deficits in learning and memory.\nIn the hippocampus, m6A methylation affects neural plasticity by modulating the miR-124-C/EBPα-FTO transcriptional axis, which regulates the expression of neural plasticity-related genes, such as\nMoreover, recent studies suggest that physical exercise can mitigate mental disorders by counteracting chronic stress-induced neural dysfunction.\nIn addition to stress factors, exposure to certain chemicals in the environment can also alter the level of m6A modification in neurons, thereby affecting neuroplasticity. For example, exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) results in an increase in m6A levels in hippocampal neurons, along with an upregulation of METTL3 expression. Treatment with STM2457, a selective METTL3 inhibitor, effectively suppresses BPA-induced m6A upregulation and restores normal synaptic transmission, further demonstrating the regulatory role of m6A in chemically induced changes in neural plasticity.\nCollectively, these findings highlight the indispensable role of m6A methylation in both the development and maintenance of neural plasticity. By regulating synaptic plasticity and neural function, m6A serves as a critical link between environmental stimuli, gene expression, and behavioral outcomes. Further investigation into the mechanisms of m6A in neural plasticity will deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of mental disorders, such as depression, and provide a strong theoretical foundation for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.\nStudies have highlighted that m6A modification plays a pivotal role in regulating neurotransmitter systems by modulating the expression of key genes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and receptor signaling. This is particularly evident in the dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems, both of which are closely linked to the pathophysiology of mental disorders.\nThe DA system is crucial for regulating emotions, motivation, and reward-related behaviors.\nFurther research has demonstrated that overexpression of FTO or the inhibition of m6A modification leads to a reduction in m6A levels within the striatum, resulting in decreased DA levels. This alteration in DA signaling may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD, suggesting that m6A could be a potential therapeutic target for DA-related disorders.\nSimilar to the DA system, the 5-HT system is vital for regulating mood, emotion, and behavior. m6A modification has been shown to influence 5-HT levels and neuronal transmission by regulating the expression of genes involved in 5-HT synthesis and metabolism.\nIncreasing evidence suggests that m6A methylation significantly influences the expression of inflammation-related genes and contributes to the development of various inflammation-associated diseases. For instance, FTO modulates the stability of cGAS mRNA by regulating m6A methylation levels, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.\nGiven the close correlation between neuroinflammation and the pathogenesis of mental disorders, as well as the role of m6A methylation in regulating neuroinflammatory processes, m6A methylation offers a promising target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating inflammation-related disorders.\nDepression is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, accompanied by intense feelings of guilt, changes in sleep and appetite, and other symptoms. In severe cases, cognitive dysfunction, abnormal behavior, and even hallucinations and delusions may occur.\nRecent studies have indicated that m6A methylation may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression (\nRoles and mechanisms of m6A modification in various mental disorders.\nPlasma or blood-derived population: *1: Patients with the first episode of schizophrenia (\nResearch on the Han Chinese population has revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the demethylase ALKBH5 may be risk factors for MDD in this group.\nFTO, another demethylase, is significantly downregulated in the hippocampus of both MDD patients and depressive mouse, leading to elevated methylation levels of Adrb2 mRNA. This methylation change mediates the development of depressive-like behaviors via the ADRB2-c-MYC-SIRT1 signaling pathway, which is also closely related to the therapeutic effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine.\nThe m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is highly expressed in CUS-induced depressive rat models, and silencing METTL3 improves cognitive deficits. Specifically, METTL3 mediates the m6A modification of pri-miR-221, promoting its maturation and upregulating miR-221-3p, which inhibits\nAs an important RNA modification, m6A methylation has shown potential as a biomarker in the diagnosis of various diseases, including cancers,\nPreclinical studies have demonstrated that modulating m6A levels can effectively reverse depressive-like behaviors in animal models. For instance, injecting cycloleucine, a compound that reduces m6A methylation by competitively inhibiting methionine adenosyltransferase (the enzyme responsible for synthesizing S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the primary methyl donor for DNA and RNA methylation) into a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors.\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by significant geographical and demographic variations. The incidence rate typically ranges from 0.5% to 1% in various countries and regions, although it may be higher in specific populations.\nResearch has demonstrated that dynamic changes in m6A modification are crucial for regulating neuronal function and are closely associated with the pathological mechanisms of schizophrenia. In the brain tissue of schizophrenia patients, abnormal levels of m6A modification may lead to dysregulated expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment and neuronal function, which subsequently affect neuronal morphology and functionality, potentially contributing to schizophrenia’s onset.\nThe development of schizophrenia is often associated with disrupted synaptic plasticity.\nIn addition to its role in disease onset, m6A modification is also implicated in the response to antipsychotic treatments.

In this regard, EBNA1 exhibits shared pentapeptide sequences with CNS-related proteins, such as GlialCAM, MBP, MOG, MAG, and SYN1.\nImportantly, we also observed that a combination of IgG, IgM, and IgA responses to HHV-6 and EBV-dUTPase significantly predicted the severity of disabilities due to MS (as measured by the EDSS) and disease progression (as assessed with the MSSS scale). These findings extend previous research that linked IgG against HHV-6 with an increased risk of MS progression, including relapses and disability.\nBoth increased EBV and HHV-6 replication may, through different mechanisms, induce MS relapses. HHV-6 reactivation may trigger or aggravate autoimmunity and tissue damage associated with MS lesion development, possibly through molecular mimicry or excessive complement activation.\nInterestingly, we found that the IgA responses to EBV and HHV-6 dUTPases were inversely correlated with the duration of illness. These findings may suggest that the replication ability of these viruses decreases with illness duration. Such an effect could play a role in the age-associated decreases in annualized relapse rate.\nWe found that the use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) did not impact the results of the present study. Indeed, the drug treatments had no significant impact on the results or resulted in a very small effect size of around 3% of the variance. Nevertheless, we found a trend toward a suppressant effect of beta-interferon-1β on the dUTPase values. Beta-interferon-1β treatment has been reported to decrease HHV-6 viral load during MS relapses, though this effect is not observed during remission.\nAlmulla et al. (2023) demonstrated that elevated levels of Th-1 and Th-17 cytokines, are significant predictors of disabilities in MS patients.\ndUTPases are recognized as PAMPs that may exacerbate immune pathology in various diseases including MS.\nIn addition, EBV-dUTPase contributes to latency by increasing the production of IL-21 and activin A.\nFurthermore, the current study provides evidence that combining EBV and HHV-6 replication indices with GF and IRS+CIRS immune profiles yields a predictive accuracy of 97.1% in diagnosing RRMS. Thus, EBV and HHV-6 replication and its consequences such immune activation, may be used to externally validate the diagnosis of RRMS. Previous research has focused on other biomarkers, such as neurofilament light chain, chitinase 3-like proteins, and microRNAs.\nIn conclusion, our results indicate that even in the remitted phase of RRMS and despite treatments with DMTs, HHV-6, and EBV replication may be present and, consequently, may contribute to new relapses. IgG/IgA/IgM responses to EBV and HHV-6 dUTPase combined with immune profiles allow to externally validate the diagnosis of RRMS. EBV and HHV-6 replication are associated with disabilities and progression of the disease. Our results suggest that the pathophysiology of RRMS involves both the reactivation/replication of latent viruses and the activation of immune-inflammatory pathways. Different mechanisms related to EBV and HHV-6 replication may explain the onset and relapsing of MS, including TLR-4 activation, inflammation, expansion of M1 macrophages and Th-17 cells, molecular mimicry, infiltration of autoreactive T cells and antibodies, neuroinflammation, and breakdown of myelin sheaths. Our findings highlight that EBV and HHV-6 dUTPases contribute to these pathways and indicate that EBV/HHV-6 dUTPases are important drug targets to treat RRMS and prevent future relapses.\nWhen interpreting the results of this study, certain limitations must be acknowledged.

MS is defined by the demyelination, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration of the nervous system,\nRecent research highlights the critical role of immune-inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in the onset of MS.\nLatent viral infections, particularly by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of MS.\nSome studies found associations between EBNA1 IgG titers and indicators of disease severity, including EDSS scores and MRI lesion activity.\nThus, this study examined whether (a) the remitted phase of RRMS is accompanied by signs of EBV and HHV-6 replication or reactivation as assessed with IgG/IgA/IgM responses to EBV-and HHV-6-dUTPase and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) peptide 386–405); and (b) whether the EBV or HHV-6 reactivation indices are associated with disabilities and progression of disease and the immune profiles observed in RRMS. This study investigated emerging serological markers of viral replication, specifically the dUTPases of HHV-6 (peptide 300–322) and EBV (peptide 243–268), as alternatives to the conventional focus on EBNA1 and viral DNA.

This reversible and dynamic modification involves methyltransferases, demethylases, and reader proteins. Aberrant expression of m6A-related regulatory proteins in the nervous system significantly impacts neuronal physiology, contributing to mental disorders such as depression, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia.

To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature search of studies published before October 2024 using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We included original research articles and review papers investigating m6A methylation in the central nervous system and its association with mental disorders, based on human, animal, or cellular models. Articles were selected for their scientific relevance, methodological rigor, and novelty. Given the high prevalence of certain psychiatric conditions and the extent of related m6A research, this review focuses specifically on depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and substance addiction.\nThe m6A methylation modification is a dynamic and reversible process regulated by 3 core groups of factors: methyltransferases (“writers”), demethylases (“erasers”), and reader proteins (“readers”).\nOverview of the m6A RNA modification machinery. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is catalyzed by a multi-component writer complex comprising METTL3, METTL14, METTL16, WTAP, VIRMA (KIAA1429), RBM15/15B, and ZC3H13. These methyltransferases install m6A modifications on mRNA bases. The modification can be reversed by eraser enzymes such as FTO and ALKBH5, which mediate m6A demethylation. Reader proteins, including YTHDF1/2/3, YTHDC1/2, IGF2BP1/2/3, FMRP, PRRC2A, ELAVL1, eIF3, and HNRNPC/A2B1, recognize and bind to m6A-modified RNA to regulate various post-transcriptional processes, such as mRNA translation, degradation, and microRNA processing.\nThe biological functions of m6A methylation modification span a wide range of physiological processes, including hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, the cell cycle, and RNA metabolism.\nThe m6A modification is essential for nervous system development. The methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 play pivotal roles in neuronal differentiation; their deletion impairs the ability of neural stem cells to differentiate into neurons, disrupting neuronal formation and function.\nThe m6A modification also has effects on oligodendrocyte specialization and myelin formation. By recognizing the GGACU consensus motif in the Olig2-encoding sequence, the reading protein PRRC2A binds and stabilizes Olig2 mRNA in an m6A-dependent mechanism.\nThese findings underscore the diverse functions of m6A modification at various stages of nervous system development, including neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, glial cell maturation, and axonal growth. The dynamic regulation of m6A methylation highlights its critical importance as a fundamental mechanism underlying both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions.\nNeural plasticity, the remarkable ability of the nervous system to adapt to internal and external environmental changes, underpins advanced neural functions such as cognition and emotion. In neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, dysregulation of m6A is closely linked to synaptic protein dysfunction, impairing synaptic plasticity and contributing to deficits in learning and memory.\nIn the hippocampus, m6A methylation affects neural plasticity by modulating the miR-124-C/EBPα-FTO transcriptional axis, which regulates the expression of neural plasticity-related genes, such as\nMoreover, recent studies suggest that physical exercise can mitigate mental disorders by counteracting chronic stress-induced neural dysfunction.\nIn addition to stress factors, exposure to certain chemicals in the environment can also alter the level of m6A modification in neurons, thereby affecting neuroplasticity. For example, exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) results in an increase in m6A levels in hippocampal neurons, along with an upregulation of METTL3 expression. Treatment with STM2457, a selective METTL3 inhibitor, effectively suppresses BPA-induced m6A upregulation and restores normal synaptic transmission, further demonstrating the regulatory role of m6A in chemically induced changes in neural plasticity.\nCollectively, these findings highlight the indispensable role of m6A methylation in both the development and maintenance of neural plasticity. By regulating synaptic plasticity and neural function, m6A serves as a critical link between environmental stimuli, gene expression, and behavioral outcomes. Further investigation into the mechanisms of m6A in neural plasticity will deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of mental disorders, such as depression, and provide a strong theoretical foundation for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.\nStudies have highlighted that m6A modification plays a pivotal role in regulating neurotransmitter systems by modulating the expression of key genes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and receptor signaling. This is particularly evident in the dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems, both of which are closely linked to the pathophysiology of mental disorders.\nThe DA system is crucial for regulating emotions, motivation, and reward-related behaviors.\nFurther research has demonstrated that overexpression of FTO or the inhibition of m6A modification leads to a reduction in m6A levels within the striatum, resulting in decreased DA levels. This alteration in DA signaling may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD, suggesting that m6A could be a potential therapeutic target for DA-related disorders.\nSimilar to the DA system, the 5-HT system is vital for regulating mood, emotion, and behavior. m6A modification has been shown to influence 5-HT levels and neuronal transmission by regulating the expression of genes involved in 5-HT synthesis and metabolism.\nIncreasing evidence suggests that m6A methylation significantly influences the expression of inflammation-related genes and contributes to the development of various inflammation-associated diseases. For instance, FTO modulates the stability of cGAS mRNA by regulating m6A methylation levels, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.\nGiven the close correlation between neuroinflammation and the pathogenesis of mental disorders, as well as the role of m6A methylation in regulating neuroinflammatory processes, m6A methylation offers a promising target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating inflammation-related disorders.\nDepression is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, accompanied by intense feelings of guilt, changes in sleep and appetite, and other symptoms. In severe cases, cognitive dysfunction, abnormal behavior, and even hallucinations and delusions may occur.\nRecent studies have indicated that m6A methylation may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression (\nRoles and mechanisms of m6A modification in various mental disorders.\nPlasma or blood-derived population: *1: Patients with the first episode of schizophrenia (\nResearch on the Han Chinese population has revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the demethylase ALKBH5 may be risk factors for MDD in this group.\nFTO, another demethylase, is significantly downregulated in the hippocampus of both MDD patients and depressive mouse, leading to elevated methylation levels of Adrb2 mRNA. This methylation change mediates the development of depressive-like behaviors via the ADRB2-c-MYC-SIRT1 signaling pathway, which is also closely related to the therapeutic effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine.\nThe m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is highly expressed in CUS-induced depressive rat models, and silencing METTL3 improves cognitive deficits. Specifically, METTL3 mediates the m6A modification of pri-miR-221, promoting its maturation and upregulating miR-221-3p, which inhibits\nAs an important RNA modification, m6A methylation has shown potential as a biomarker in the diagnosis of various diseases, including cancers,\nPreclinical studies have demonstrated that modulating m6A levels can effectively reverse depressive-like behaviors in animal models. For instance, injecting cycloleucine, a compound that reduces m6A methylation by competitively inhibiting methionine adenosyltransferase (the enzyme responsible for synthesizing S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the primary methyl donor for DNA and RNA methylation) into a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors.\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by significant geographical and demographic variations. The incidence rate typically ranges from 0.5% to 1% in various countries and regions, although it may be higher in specific populations.\nResearch has demonstrated that dynamic changes in m6A modification are crucial for regulating neuronal function and are closely associated with the pathological mechanisms of schizophrenia. In the brain tissue of schizophrenia patients, abnormal levels of m6A modification may lead to dysregulated expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment and neuronal function, which subsequently affect neuronal morphology and functionality, potentially contributing to schizophrenia’s onset.\nThe development of schizophrenia is often associated with disrupted synaptic plasticity.\nIn addition to its role in disease onset, m6A modification is also implicated in the response to antipsychotic treatments. Studies have found significant changes in the methylation patterns of both DNA and RNA in schizophrenia patients following conventional drug treatment.\nThrough the analysis of m6A methylation patterns, researchers are gaining a deeper understanding of the biological basis of schizophrenia, thereby providing new approaches for early screening and personalized treatment.\nAutism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication skills, along with repetitive behaviors and restricted interests.\nIntegrated analysis of multi-omics data has revealed that abnormalities in m6A modification are closely linked to the onset of ASD,\nIn recent years, an increasing body of research has suggested that m6A methylation modification may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ASD. Through integrative multi-omics analyses, studies have found that abnormal m6A modification is closely associated with the onset of ASD.\nAnimal models and in vitro cell experiments have also confirmed the involvement of m6A modification in ASD pathogenesis. By manipulating m6A modification levels in cells using gene editing technologies, researchers observed gene expression changes associated with ASD, providing direct evidence for the role of m6A modification in the disorder.\nN6-methyladenosine modification contributes to the pathological process of ASD by regulating key signaling pathways. One critical m6A reader protein, YTHDF1, plays an essential role in axon and dendrite development. YTHDF1 regulates synaptic development and plasticity by promoting the translation of Robo3.1, an axon guidance protein. However, when mutations occur at the m6A modification sites, YTHDF1 loses its ability to regulate Robo3.1 translation, resulting in abnormal synaptic transmission and plasticity, which subsequently impairs memory consolidation.\nMoreover, research has found that in the hippocampal tissue of ASD patients or model mice, the expression of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is significantly downregulated, accompanied by downregulation of long non-coding RNA MALAT1 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while the expression of the inhibitory molecule SFRP2 is upregulated. These changes contribute to the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, exacerbating the pathological process of ASD.\nAbnormal m6A modification in ASD patients exhibits significant molecular characteristics, which could potentially serve as biomarkers for the disorder. By detecting m6A levels in peripheral blood, researchers could identify high-risk individuals for ASD before clinical symptoms appear, facilitating early intervention. Additionally, the combined use of m6A detection with other biomarkers, in conjunction with multi-omics data, could significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of ASD screening.\nCurrent research indicates that targeting m6A methylation regulation may provide new therapeutic strategies for ASD. For example, modulating METTL3 expression levels could repair the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, reduce hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and improve ASD-related behaviors. This highlights the important role of m6A modification in the pathogenesis of ASD and its potential as a therapeutic target. Future large-scale clinical studies and in-depth mechanistic investigations will provide further evidence to support this field.\nDrug addiction is a chronic and relapsing brain disorder, primarily characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, along with a loss of control over drug consumption.\nCocaine is a highly addictive stimulant. Research has shown that in a cocaine-induced mouse conditioned place preference (CPP) experiment, the expression of FTO in the hippocampus was significantly downregulated, while the expression of methyltransferases such as METTL3 and METTL14 did not show significant changes. This suggests that FTO may play a key role in the regulation of cocaine addiction. Further analysis through methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq), a technique that maps m6A-methylated RNA, revealed that the overall m6A modification levels in the hippocampus of cocaine-treated mice were significantly elevated when compared with control group, with changes in m6A peaks primarily involving genes related to glutamatergic synapses, long-term potentiation (LTP), axon guidance, and neuronal function. These findings indicate that the dynamic changes in FTO expression and m6A modification may mediate the onset of cocaine addiction by regulating synaptic maturation and localization.\nIn a separate study using opioids such as oxycodone to induce rewarding behaviors in mice, researchers observed a marked increase in the protein levels of METTL14 and overall m6A modification in striatal neurons. In contrast, the expression of PP1α, a protein phosphatase, was found to decrease. These results suggest a close relationship between m6A methylation and opioid addiction. Further investigation pointed to lncRNA HOTAIR as a potential mediator in this process.\nIn contrast to cocaine addiction, a study on morphine addiction in mice found that neither acute nor chronic morphine exposure significantly altered m6A modification levels or the expression of m6A methyltransferases (such as METTL3) in the brain. This suggests that m6A methylation modification may not be involved in the regulatory process of morphine addiction, or its mechanisms may differ from those involved in other addictive substances.\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is another prevalent form of addiction characterized by compulsive drinking, alcohol craving, increased tolerance, and severe withdrawal symptoms. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region involved in DA-mediated reward and pleasure, has been implicated in the development of alcohol addiction. In a mouse model of long-term alcohol consumption, RNA methylation changes were associated with specific gene expression alterations, leading to enhanced neural adaptation to alcohol. Through epigenomic microarray analysis, researchers identified 26 mRNAs and 4 lncRNAs in the NAc of AUD subjects that were highly methylated, while the methylation level of 3 mRNAs and 1 lncRNA was significantly reduced. These results suggest that m6A methylation may play a role in the neural adaptation processes underlying alcohol addiction. However, these findings need to be replicated in larger sample sizes, and future research should explore whether these changes are gender- or population-specific.\nThis review focused on 4 major psychiatric disorders—depression, schizophrenia, ASD, and drug addiction. Although other conditions such as anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorder also exhibit high prevalence and clinical importance, current research on m6A modification in these disorders remains limited. This gap underscores the need for future investigations, which may contribute to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets across a broader range of psychiatric conditions.\nThrough an integrated analysis of m6A modifications in the aforementioned disorders, we found that several key m6A-regulating enzymes, such as METTL3, ALKBH5, and FTO, exhibit similar patterns of dysregulation across different mental illnesses. Moreover, these enzymes are primarily involved in the onset and progression of psychiatric disorders by modulating similar processes, including neuroinflammation, neurodevelopment, and synaptic plasticity. These parallels not only reflect the presence of shared pathogenic mechanisms among various mental disorders but also underscore the indispensable role of m6A regulatory enzymes in initiating epitranscriptomic alterations that contribute to disease development.\nNevertheless, it is important to recognize that, although current studies on m6A modification in mental disorders remain limited, distinct brain region- or cell types-specific differences have been observed in the patterns of m6A modification and the expression of its regulatory enzymes across different psychiatric conditions. The specific RNAs undergoing m6A modification, as well as the downstream signaling pathways they modulate, also vary widely. Therefore, further elucidation of the downstream molecular networks governed by m6A modification is critically needed.\nLooking forward, this complexity poses an important question for therapeutic development: should strategies targeting m6A pathways adopt a broad-spectrum approach, or be tailored specifically to the molecular landscape of each disorder? Addressing this question will be essential for translating m6A-related findings into clinically meaningful interventions.\nFurthermore, the emergence of single-cell sequencing technologies provides new opportunities to investigate m6A methylation dynamics at high resolution. Future studies leveraging these approaches will enhance our understanding of m6A functions in distinct neuronal subtypes and disease-relevant cellular contexts.\nFinally, the development of small-molecule modulators—such as agonists or antagonists of m6A-associated proteins—holds great promise for therapeutic innovation. Such tools may enable precision medicine approaches tailored to individual molecular profiles. Continued research in this direction will not only deepen our understanding of m6A biology but also advance the design of effective, targeted treatments for psychiatric disorders.", "content_for_embedding": "Epigenetic modifications are heritable changes in gene expression driven by environmental factors or intracellular mechanisms that do not alter the DNA sequence.\nMental illnesses represent a significant global challenge, imposing substantial burdens on individuals, society, and economies.\nThe m6A modification is crucial for the normal development and physiological functioning of the nervous system, including its roles in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, synaptic transmission, and the cognitive function.\nGenetic loci regulating m6A levels as quantitative traits (m6A quantitative trait loci, or m6A-QTLs) have been identified in various human tissues, including the brain.\nIn this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying m6A methylation, its roles in psychiatric disorders, and its emerging potential as a therapeutic target.

Further investigation into the mechanisms of m6A in neural plasticity will deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of mental disorders, such as depression, and provide a strong theoretical foundation for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.\nStudies have highlighted that m6A modification plays a pivotal role in regulating neurotransmitter systems by modulating the expression of key genes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and receptor signaling. This is particularly evident in the dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems, both of which are closely linked to the pathophysiology of mental disorders.\nThe DA system is crucial for regulating emotions, motivation, and reward-related behaviors.\nFurther research has demonstrated that overexpression of FTO or the inhibition of m6A modification leads to a reduction in m6A levels within the striatum, resulting in decreased DA levels. This alteration in DA signaling may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD, suggesting that m6A could be a potential therapeutic target for DA-related disorders.\nSimilar to the DA system, the 5-HT system is vital for regulating mood, emotion, and behavior. m6A modification has been shown to influence 5-HT levels and neuronal transmission by regulating the expression of genes involved in 5-HT synthesis and metabolism.\nIncreasing evidence suggests that m6A methylation significantly influences the expression of inflammation-related genes and contributes to the development of various inflammation-associated diseases. For instance, FTO modulates the stability of cGAS mRNA by regulating m6A methylation levels, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.\nGiven the close correlation between neuroinflammation and the pathogenesis of mental disorders, as well as the role of m6A methylation in regulating neuroinflammatory processes, m6A methylation offers a promising target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating inflammation-related disorders.\nDepression is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, accompanied by intense feelings of guilt, changes in sleep and appetite, and other symptoms. In severe cases, cognitive dysfunction, abnormal behavior, and even hallucinations and delusions may occur.\nRecent studies have indicated that m6A methylation may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression (\nRoles and mechanisms of m6A modification in various mental disorders.\nPlasma or blood-derived population: *1: Patients with the first episode of schizophrenia (\nResearch on the Han Chinese population has revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the demethylase ALKBH5 may be risk factors for MDD in this group.\nFTO, another demethylase, is significantly downregulated in the hippocampus of both MDD patients and depressive mouse, leading to elevated methylation levels of Adrb2 mRNA. This methylation change mediates the development of depressive-like behaviors via the ADRB2-c-MYC-SIRT1 signaling pathway, which is also closely related to the therapeutic effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine.\nThe m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is highly expressed in CUS-induced depressive rat models, and silencing METTL3 improves cognitive deficits. Specifically, METTL3 mediates the m6A modification of pri-miR-221, promoting its maturation and upregulating miR-221-3p, which inhibits\nAs an important RNA modification, m6A methylation has shown potential as a biomarker in the diagnosis of various diseases, including cancers,\nPreclinical studies have demonstrated that modulating m6A levels can effectively reverse depressive-like behaviors in animal models. For instance, injecting cycloleucine, a compound that reduces m6A methylation by competitively inhibiting methionine adenosyltransferase (the enzyme responsible for synthesizing S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the primary methyl donor for DNA and RNA methylation) into a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors.\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by significant geographical and demographic variations. The incidence rate typically ranges from 0.5% to 1% in various countries and regions, although it may be higher in specific populations.\nResearch has demonstrated that dynamic changes in m6A modification are crucial for regulating neuronal function and are closely associated with the pathological mechanisms of schizophrenia. In the brain tissue of schizophrenia patients, abnormal levels of m6A modification may lead to dysregulated expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment and neuronal function, which subsequently affect neuronal morphology and functionality, potentially contributing to schizophrenia’s onset.\nThe development of schizophrenia is often associated with disrupted synaptic plasticity.\nIn addition to its role in disease onset, m6A modification is also implicated in the response to antipsychotic treatments. Studies have found significant changes in the methylation patterns of both DNA and RNA in schizophrenia patients following conventional drug treatment.\nThrough the analysis of m6A methylation patterns, researchers are gaining a deeper understanding of the biological basis of schizophrenia, thereby providing new approaches for early screening and personalized treatment.\nAutism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication skills, along with repetitive behaviors and restricted interests.\nIntegrated analysis of multi-omics data has revealed that abnormalities in m6A modification are closely linked to the onset of ASD,\nIn recent years, an increasing body of research has suggested that m6A methylation modification may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ASD. Through integrative multi-omics analyses, studies have found that abnormal m6A modification is closely associated with the onset of ASD.\nAnimal models and in vitro cell experiments have also confirmed the involvement of m6A modification in ASD pathogenesis. By manipulating m6A modification levels in cells using gene editing technologies, researchers observed gene expression changes associated with ASD, providing direct evidence for the role of m6A modification in the disorder.\nN6-methyladenosine modification contributes to the pathological process of ASD by regulating key signaling pathways. One critical m6A reader protein, YTHDF1, plays an essential role in axon and dendrite development. YTHDF1 regulates synaptic development and plasticity by promoting the translation of Robo3.1, an axon guidance protein. However, when mutations occur at the m6A modification sites, YTHDF1 loses its ability to regulate Robo3.1 translation, resulting in abnormal synaptic transmission and plasticity, which subsequently impairs memory consolidation.\nMoreover, research has found that in the hippocampal tissue of ASD patients or model mice, the expression of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is significantly downregulated, accompanied by downregulation of long non-coding RNA MALAT1 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while the expression of the inhibitory molecule SFRP2 is upregulated. These changes contribute to the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, exacerbating the pathological process of ASD.\nAbnormal m6A modification in ASD patients exhibits significant molecular characteristics, which could potentially serve as biomarkers for the disorder. By detecting m6A levels in peripheral blood, researchers could identify high-risk individuals for ASD before clinical symptoms appear, facilitating early intervention. Additionally, the combined use of m6A detection with other biomarkers, in conjunction with multi-omics data, could significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of ASD screening.\nCurrent research indicates that targeting m6A methylation regulation may provide new therapeutic strategies for ASD. For example, modulating METTL3 expression levels could repair the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, reduce hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and improve ASD-related behaviors. This highlights the important role of m6A modification in the pathogenesis of ASD and its potential as a therapeutic target. Future large-scale clinical studies and in-depth mechanistic investigations will provide further evidence to support this field.\nDrug addiction is a chronic and relapsing brain disorder, primarily characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, along with a loss of control over drug consumption.\nCocaine is a highly addictive stimulant. Research has shown that in a cocaine-induced mouse conditioned place preference (CPP) experiment, the expression of FTO in the hippocampus was significantly downregulated, while the expression of methyltransferases such as METTL3 and METTL14 did not show significant changes. This suggests that FTO may play a key role in the regulation of cocaine addiction. Further analysis through methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq), a technique that maps m6A-methylated RNA, revealed that the overall m6A modification levels in the hippocampus of cocaine-treated mice were significantly elevated when compared with control group, with changes in m6A peaks primarily involving genes related to glutamatergic synapses, long-term potentiation (LTP), axon guidance, and neuronal function. These findings indicate that the dynamic changes in FTO expression and m6A modification may mediate the onset of cocaine addiction by regulating synaptic maturation and localization.\nIn a separate study using opioids such as oxycodone to induce rewarding behaviors in mice, researchers observed a marked increase in the protein levels of METTL14 and overall m6A modification in striatal neurons. In contrast, the expression of PP1α, a protein phosphatase, was found to decrease. These results suggest a close relationship between m6A methylation and opioid addiction. Further investigation pointed to lncRNA HOTAIR as a potential mediator in this process.\nIn contrast to cocaine addiction, a study on morphine addiction in mice found that neither acute nor chronic morphine exposure significantly altered m6A modification levels or the expression of m6A methyltransferases (such as METTL3) in the brain. This suggests that m6A methylation modification may not be involved in the regulatory process of morphine addiction, or its mechanisms may differ from those involved in other addictive substances.\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is another prevalent form of addiction characterized by compulsive drinking, alcohol craving, increased tolerance, and severe withdrawal symptoms. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region involved in DA-mediated reward and pleasure, has been implicated in the development of alcohol addiction. In a mouse model of long-term alcohol consumption, RNA methylation changes were associated with specific gene expression alterations, leading to enhanced neural adaptation to alcohol. Through epigenomic microarray analysis, researchers identified 26 mRNAs and 4 lncRNAs in the NAc of AUD subjects that were highly methylated, while the methylation level of 3 mRNAs and 1 lncRNA was significantly reduced. These results suggest that m6A methylation may play a role in the neural adaptation processes underlying alcohol addiction. However, these findings need to be replicated in larger sample sizes, and future research should explore whether these changes are gender- or population-specific.\nThis review focused on 4 major psychiatric disorders—depression, schizophrenia, ASD, and drug addiction. Although other conditions such as anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorder also exhibit high prevalence and clinical importance, current research on m6A modification in these disorders remains limited. This gap underscores the need for future investigations, which may contribute to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets across a broader range of psychiatric conditions.\nThrough an integrated analysis of m6A modifications in the aforementioned disorders, we found that several key m6A-regulating enzymes, such as METTL3, ALKBH5, and FTO, exhibit similar patterns of dysregulation across different mental illnesses. Moreover, these enzymes are primarily involved in the onset and progression of psychiatric disorders by modulating similar processes, including neuroinflammation, neurodevelopment, and synaptic plasticity. These parallels not only reflect the presence of shared pathogenic mechanisms among various mental disorders but also underscore the indispensable role of m6A regulatory enzymes in initiating epitranscriptomic alterations that contribute to disease development.\nNevertheless, it is important to recognize that, although current studies on m6A modification in mental disorders remain limited, distinct brain region- or cell types-specific differences have been observed in the patterns of m6A modification and the expression of its regulatory enzymes across different psychiatric conditions. The specific RNAs undergoing m6A modification, as well as the downstream signaling pathways they modulate, also vary widely. Therefore, further elucidation of the downstream molecular networks governed by m6A modification is critically needed.\nLooking forward, this complexity poses an important question for therapeutic development: should strategies targeting m6A pathways adopt a broad-spectrum approach, or be tailored specifically to the molecular landscape of each disorder? Addressing this question will be essential for translating m6A-related findings into clinically meaningful interventions.\nFurthermore, the emergence of single-cell sequencing technologies provides new opportunities to investigate m6A methylation dynamics at high resolution. Future studies leveraging these approaches will enhance our understanding of m6A functions in distinct neuronal subtypes and disease-relevant cellular contexts.\nFinally, the development of small-molecule modulators—such as agonists or antagonists of m6A-associated proteins—holds great promise for therapeutic innovation. Such tools may enable precision medicine approaches tailored to individual molecular profiles. Continued research in this direction will not only deepen our understanding of m6A biology but also advance the design of effective, targeted treatments for psychiatric disorders.", "topic": "Social_neurology"}

These conditions not only impact the quality of life of affected individuals but also pose significant challenges for caregivers and healthcare systems.\nCognitive training has emerged as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for cognitive impairments. The underlying premise is that targeted cognitive training can enhance the cognitive capacity and improve within the cognitive domain, potentially transferring to behavioral, neural, and biopsychosocial aspects.\nIn this context, our study introduces a novel approach by incorporating virtual reality (VR) technology into cognitive training.\nWe hypothesize that compared to baseline status, the VR-based cognitive training program will lead to significant improvements in various cognitive domains, particularly memory, which is often one of the first areas affected in MCI.\nThis pilot study included 32 participants, who were part of the PREMIER (precision medicine platform for mild cognitive impairment on multi-omics, imaging, evidence-based R&D) study, a prospective, community-based cohort focusing on MCI. They visited the Dementia Center in Bucheon, South Korea, which is dedicated to comprehensive management of individuals with cognitive decline. The center offers services such as dementia prevention education, cognitive rehabilitation, early detection of cognitive impairment, and support for treatment. The participants underwent evaluation using the Korean version of clinical and neuropsychological (NP) assessment battery (Korean version of Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease [CERAD-K]), a detailed NP test.\nThe program was conducted individually using an immersive VR device connected to a tablet PC, a VR Head Mounted Display and Pico NEO 3 Eye (PICO, Beijing, China). The VR cognitive intervention consisted of a 12-week program, with sessions held twice per week (total 24 sessions). Each session included 50 minutes of VR-based training, focusing on cognitive stimulation for 30 minutes, physical exercise for 16 minutes, and meditation for 2 minutes. After cognitive training and physical exercise, participants take a break by removing the VR display.\nAll cognitive training tasks were originally developed for this study and have not been previously reported in prior literature. The cognitive stimulation program was designed to cover 6 cognitive domains: executive function, attention, visuospatial ability, calculation, memory, and language. Each domain contained 2 distinct task formats to ensure varied cognitive stimulation and minimize habituation over the 12-week intervention. All tasks were delivered in a gamified format and provided real-time audiovisual feedback to promote engagement and reinforce cognitive learning. The specific tasks for each domain are detailed in\nAll tasks were designed with 3 difficulty levels (easy, moderate, hard), and the system adaptively adjusted progression based on individual performance to maintain optimal challenge.\nFor executive function, tasks were designed to target rule inference, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility. Patients complete tasks based on assumed rules and tap a tambourine of varying colors or notes as instructed. In the attention domain, tasks aimed to enhance sustained attention and working memory. Participants identify spinning, overlapped numbers and play a xylophone according to presented colors or notes. For the visuospatial domain, patients count the number of circling boxes and complete empty puzzles, stimulating visual tracking and spatial reasoning. In the calculation, they perform mental arithmetic to identify numbers on dice and sum the total price of items in a grocery scenario. For memory domain, patients recall the locations of various items and information about presented individuals, engaging both visual and episodic memory processes. In the language domain, patients locate words arranged horizontally or vertically in a panel of mixed characters and complete missing syllables in words, stimulating lexical retrieval and orthographic processing. The challenging levels included easy, moderate, and hard modes, where successful completion of one difficulty level led to an escalation in challenge for the subsequent trial, consistent with evidence suggesting that adaptive difficulty enhances cognitive training outcomes.\nPhysical exercise program offers the training whether during sitting or standing. The physical exercise program offers training adaptable for execution in either a seated or standing position. Participants opting for standing exercises engage in marching in place, rotating clockwise and counterclockwise, waving one arm followed by both arms, and drawing circles with each arm. Those selecting seated exercises perform arm waves, trunk leans in various directions, arm circles, and drum hitting. During the meditation period, participants practice deep breathing against a backdrop of natural scenery and birdsong.\nFor assessing the outcomes, we utilized NP tests and questionnaires both at the baseline and at the end of the 12-week program. For assessment of cognitive function, participants underwent a computerized NP test (Inbrain Cognitive Screening Test [CST]),\nInitially, every participant responded to various questionnaires covering depression (short form of the geriatric depression scale, with 15 items scored 0–15; higher scores indicate more severe symptoms),\nThe primary outcome was the total score of Inbrain CST. Secondary cognitive outcomes included domain-specific composite scores from Inbrain CST and individual memory test scores (immediate, delayed recall, and recognition of WPAT).\nParticipants in the study underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at 2 time points: baseline and 12 weeks post-participation in the VR-based training program. The scans were performed using a 3T Magnetom Skyra MRI system (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) located at Bucheon Soonchunhyang Hospital. During the scanning session, participants were asked to lie down, close their eyes, and rest. Whole-brain functional images were obtained using a fast field-echo planar imaging sequence (repetition time=3,000 ms, echo time=30 ms, matrix=64×64, field of view=224 mm, flip angle=90°, slice thickness=3.5 mm/0 gap, slices=42, volumes=120, total time=369 seconds).\nThe CONN toolbox (release 20b),\nThe Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical atlas was used to parcellate the brain into 132 regions of interest (ROIs).\nTo assess alterations in functional connectivity after cognitive training, we used the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) method\nFor continuous variables, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was adopted to compare scores from the NP battery and various questionnaires between baseline and after the 12-week (24 sessions) intervention. The SSQ scores were averaged over the first week (encompassing the first and second sessions) and the twelfth week (covering the twenty-third and twenty-fourth sessions). The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the average SSQ scores between the first and twelfth weeks.\nOut of the 32 enrolled patients with MCI, 28 successfully completed the 12-week VR-based cognitive training program. Four participants withdrew from the study: one due to poor vision, which hindered the administration of the VR cognitive training, and 3 owing to personal reasons, including discomfort with the frequency of visits. The majority of these participants were women, constituting 24 out of 28 (87.5%), with an average age of 73.21±4.20 years. The average education level was 8.61±4.55 years. The primary outcome, assessed through the Inbrain CST NP test, revealed significant improvements post-training. Specifically, the total composite score exhibited a noteworthy increase from the baseline score of 49.04±9.15 to 52.96±9.53 post-intervention (\nData are expressed as the mean with standard deviation.\nMMSE: Mini-Mental Status Examination, CST: computerized screening test.\nFU: follow-up.\nIn terms of secondary outcomes encompassing mental health and daily functioning, the study did not observe significant changes between baseline and post-training evaluations. These measures included depression, anxiety, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living, assessed through various questionnaires and scales. Regarding safety and discomfort related to intervention, there was no significant difference in the UCLA-DQ scores before and after the intervention (\nData are expressed as the mean with standard deviation.\nK-IADL: Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, SF-GDS: short form of the geriatric depression scale, GAI: geriatric anxiety inventory, GQOL-D: Geriatric Quality of Life-Dementia, NPI: neuropsychiatric inventory, UCLA-DQ: University of California Los Angeles Dizziness Questionnaire, SSQ: Simulator Sickness Questionnaire.\nFunctional connectivity analysis revealed a significant cluster of increased connectivity following cognitive training (TFCE=95.77, p-FWE=0.032;\nThreshold free cluster enhancement, family-wise error corrected threshold of\nROI: region of interest, pPaHC: posterior division of the parahippocampal gyrus, R: right, L: left, Cereb9: cerebellum 9.\naPaHC: anterior division of the parahippocampal gyrus, pPaHC: posterior division of the parahippocampal gyrus, L: left, R: right, Cereb9: cerebellum 9.\nThe findings of our study indicate that a 12-week VR-based cognitive training program can feasibly be implemented in patients with MCI, with potential improvements in cognitive functions, particularly memory. This is evident from the notable improvements in the total and memory-specific composite scores of the Inbrain CST NP test.\nUntil now, effective treatments for MCI status have been limited. Various nonpharmacological interventions, including physical exercise, cognitive training, and diet, have been investigated and shown advantages, but have failed to prevent dementia progression.\nMeta-analysis on the effectiveness of cognitive training in MCI found that compared to control interventions, there were slight to moderate beneficial effects on global cognitive function, memory, language, working memory, and executive function.\nCompared to simple computer-based cognitive training, the VR cognitive stimulation program provides a much closer approximation to real-life environments.\nThe outcome of cognitive function can be assessed through task performance in specific cognitive domains, as well as questionnaires evaluating IADL, neuropsychiatric behaviours, and psychiatric aspects. Furthermore, objective assessments using neuroimaging techniques such as brain volume and functional connectivity can be employed to measure changes resulting from cognitive training.\nInterestingly, our study showed altered brain connectivity with the amygdala and cerebellar 9 area. Considering the amygdala’s significant roles in attention, associative learning, and emotion processing,\nHowever, it is important to note that this enhancement in cognitive performance did not extend to other aspects of mental health and daily functioning, such as depression, anxiety, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The lack of significant change in these secondary outcomes suggests that while VR-based cognitive training is effective in targeting specific cognitive domains, its impact on broader mental health and daily functioning may be limited. This finding aligns with the growing body of research indicating that cognitive training can yield domain-specific improvements.\nTaken together, the findings from this pilot study suggest that VR-based cognitive training is a feasible and potentially beneficial intervention for MCI. However, several limitations inherent in the study design warrant cautious interpretation of the results. First, this study is a single-arm pilot study without a control group, the findings are vulnerable to confounding factors such as natural learning effects or test-retest effects. Second, although significant changes were observed in cognitive performance and resting-state functional connectivity, the absence of a control group limits causal inferences regarding the effects of the intervention. Third, the durability of the cognitive improvements observed after the 12-week intervention remains unclear. Future studies incorporating long-term follow-up assessments will be necessary to determine whether sustained cognitive benefits can be achieved without ongoing intervention. Fourth, although the rs-fMRI analysis provided insights into neuroplastic changes, establishing causality between functional connectivity and cognitive improvement requires more sophisticated imaging analyses and larger samples. Lastly, the small sample size also limits the generalizability of the results. Future research should aim to include larger and more diverse samples and possibly adopt a randomized controlled trial design to strengthen the evidence for the effectiveness of VR-based cognitive training in MCI.\nIn conclusion, our pilot study demonstrated post-VR cognitive training changes in cognitive functioning compared to baseline, alongside confirmed alterations in brain connectivity among patients with MCI. It also opens avenues for further research to explore the potential of VR technology in cognitive rehabilitation, particularly in neurodegenerative conditions where treatment options are limited.", "content_for_embedding": "The aging population is experiencing a surge in the prevalence of cognitive impairments, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.

Future research should aim to include larger and more diverse samples and possibly adopt a randomized controlled trial design to strengthen the evidence for the effectiveness of VR-based cognitive training in MCI.\nIn conclusion, our pilot study demonstrated post-VR cognitive training changes in cognitive functioning compared to baseline, alongside confirmed alterations in brain connectivity among patients with MCI. It also opens avenues for further research to explore the potential of VR technology in cognitive rehabilitation, particularly in neurodegenerative conditions where treatment options are limited.", "topic": "Social_neurology"}

To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of these 2 instruments in a sample not restricted to older or highly educated individuals, as seen in prior studies.\nAlthough the 60-and-above group showed lower mean scores on both T-MoCA and K-MoCA-22, the difference between the 2 test scores did not significantly vary by age group. This suggests that the relative comparability of the 2 tests may be consistent across age strata, despite absolute performance differences.\nConsistent with previous research,\nLin’s CCC demonstrated strong agreement between the T-MoCA and K-MoCA-22 in the total sample and in the 60-and-above group. In contrast, CCC was markedly lower in the under-60 group, indicating attenuated agreement likely due to ceiling effects, as most younger participants scored near the maximum on both tests. Importantly, the bias correction factor remained consistently high across all groups, indicating minimal systematic bias between test formats. These results suggest that, despite differing correlation magnitudes, the T-MoCA and K-MoCA-22 yield generally comparable scoring patterns across administration modes.\nEquivalence testing using TOST procedure confirmed statistical equivalence between the T-MoCA and K-MoCA-22 in the total sample and the under-60 group, with the 80% confidence intervals falling within the pre-defined equivalence bounds (±0.75). However, equivalence was not established in the 60-and-above group, as the upper bound of the confidence interval exceeded the threshold. Despite this, the mean difference between the 2 tests in this group was relatively small (0.45±1.95), suggesting that the clinical significance of this discrepancy may be limited. Nevertheless, clinicians should be aware that T-MoCA scores may appear slightly elevated when interpreted using K-MoCA-22–based norms. These findings support the general comparability of the 2 tests but also highlight the need for caution when using them interchangeably in older populations.\nThe Bland–Altman analysis further reinforced these conclusions by showing no evidence of systematic bias.

Nonetheless, the failure to demonstrate statistical equivalence in the 60-and-above group suggests that the tests may not be fully interchangeable in this age cohort. At the same time, the absence of systematic bias in the Bland–Altman plot implies that the observed differences are random rather than systematic.

Approximately 25% of older participants (n=15) in the sample reported mild hearing difficulties, and indeed, in-person assessments may provide visual cues—such as facial expressions, gestures, and lip movements—that can facilitate auditory comprehension in older adults. However, even among older participants (n=45) who did not report any hearing problems, repetition scores on the K-MoCA-22 remained significantly higher than those on the T-MoCA (\nThe relatively higher delayed recall scores observed in the T-MoCA may be attributable to several contextual factors. One possible explanation involves limitations in examiner supervision during remote testing. Although participants were explicitly instructed not to take notes, use memory aids, or switch the phone to their non-dominant hand, the unsupervised nature of telephone administration may have permitted subtle forms of noncompliance. In the present study, suspected instances of such behavior were observed, and similar concerns have been raised in prior research.\nIn addition to reduced supervision, psychological factors may also have contributed to the elevated delayed recall scores in the T-MoCA. Some participants reported feeling less anxious during the telephone assessment, potentially due to the absence of direct interaction with the examiner. Prior studies\nAs noted earlier, regression analyses indicated that educational level did not significantly influence the difference scores between the 2 tests. To further examine whether education moderated equivalence in older adults, the 60-and-above group was stratified using a 9-year education cutoff. However, statistical equivalence was not observed in either subgroup (under 9 years:\nFinally, although this study focused on cognitively normal community-dwelling adults, challenges observed during T-MoCA administration in older participants—such as reduced attentional engagement, difficulty comprehending instructions, and limited examiner monitoring—raise concerns about its applicability in clinical populations. Individuals with cognitive impairment (e.g., MCI or dementia) may face even greater challenges in completing the T-MoCA. Therefore, the equivalence observed in this study may not generalize to cognitively impaired individuals. Future research should clarify the extent to which T-MoCA scores can be considered reliable and equivalent to in-person MoCA scores as cognitive impairment progresses.\nIn conclusion, the T-MoCA appears to be an equivalent and reliable remote alternative to the face-to-face K-MoCA-22 for cognitive screening in the general population. However, given the observed age-related differences in test equivalence and modality-specific discrepancies at the subtest level, clinicians and researchers should interpret T-MoCA scores in older adults with caution.

Growing evidence shows that endogenous NSCs in mammals and humans can shift between quiescence and active proliferation, supporting neurogenesis and gliogenesis during inflammatory CNS disorders (Martino and Pluchino\nRecent studies on inflammatory CNS disorders suggest that dysfunction within the microenvironmental niches where NSCs reside may be responsible for their inability to achieve full restoration (Pluchino et al.\nVarious regenerative approaches have been explored to prevent disease progression and enhance repair mechanisms by targeting the CNS microenvironment. Therapies that can directly or indirectly target the niche microenvironment to restore NSC behavior and promote neuronal regeneration could have a significant impact on the treatment of inflammatory CNS disorders (Martino and Pluchino\nNSCs exert many of their biological effects through their secretome, notably via EVs—nano‐ to micro‐sized, lipid bilayer‐enclosed particles that are secreted by cells and lack replication capacity (Welsh et al.\nEVs are broadly classified based on size, biogenesis, and composition into three main subtypes: exosomes (30–150 nm), which are formed within the endosomal pathway and released through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane; microvesicles (100–1000 nm), also known as ectosomes, which originate by direct outward budding of the plasma membrane; and apoptotic bodies (50–4000 nm), which are shed from cells undergoing programmed cell death and contain nuclear fragments and organelles (Welsh et al.\nBeyond the canonical subtypes, additional vesicular and non‐vesicular extracellular particles have been described, reflecting the expanding complexity of intercellular communication. These include ARMMS (arrestin domain‐containing protein 1‐mediated microvesicles) involved in Notch signaling; migrasomes, which bud from retraction fibers of migrating cells and mediate tissue remodeling; and exophers, which expel damaged cellular components under stress (Wang et al.\nConsistent with the minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles (MISEV) 2023 guidelines, we avoid using terms such as “\nThe unique and multifunctional ability of EVs to influence multiple biological pathways makes them particularly attractive candidates for addressing the complex pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. By modulating the microenvironment of the CNS, NSC‐derived EVs have emerged as a promising cell‐free biotherapeutic strategy, capable of replicating many of the beneficial effects of NSC transplantation while circumventing challenges related to cell survival, immune rejection, and tumorigenic risk. Particularly compelling is their ability to mediate neuroimmune interactions, promote neural repair, and modulate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. These vesicles have been shown to influence key pathophysiological processes in both neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions, including neuroprotection, immune regulation, synaptic plasticity, and tissue regeneration.\nHere we will explore recent advances in biotherapeutic approaches for treating neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on NSC‐derived EVs. It will delve into their mechanisms of action, particularly their role in modulating inflammatory pathways, neuroprotection, and neurometabolic support, while also discussing recent progress in preclinical and clinical applications. Furthermore, we will critically examine the challenges associated with the clinical translation of NSC‐derived EVs. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to highlight the therapeutic frontiers of NSC‐derived EVs in treating neurodegenerative diseases and advancing neural regeneration.\nIn recent years, several innovative biotherapeutic strategies have emerged to promote neural repair by either activating the brain's intrinsic regenerative capacity or introducing exogenous sources of support. Although significant progress has been made—using neurotrophic factors, neutralizing antibodies, gene therapy, biomaterials, and cell‐based therapies—major challenges remain that limit the clinical translation of these approaches.\nThis section explores both avenues: enhancing endogenous repair mechanisms and employing exogenous interventions to highlight current advances and future directions in CNS regeneration. Finally, the unique advantages of NSC‐derived EVs and their potential to overcome the limitations of existing regenerative strategies will be outlined.\nExperimental studies have identified key populations (Figure\nLimited endogenous repair potential and main strategies for neural regeneration. (a) Main stem cell‐like populations in the adult brain include neural stem cells (NSCs) or ependymal cells (ECs) located in neurogenic niches such as the subventricular zone (SVZ), subgranular zone (SGZ), amygdala, striatum, cortex, and hypothalamus. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are distributed throughout the brain and contribute to myelination and neural repair. Perivascular mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and pericytes reside in the vascular niche, while brain endothelial cells (BECs) within the blood–brain barrier (BBB) exhibit progenitor‐like properties. (b) Endogenous stem cells possess self‐renewal capacity and multipotency, enabling neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Their function is tightly regulated by the microenvironment, including soluble factors (cytokines, neurotrophins), extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying signaling molecules and mitochondria, and neuroimmune interactions. However, their repair capacity is inherently limited and declines with aging, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunctions. (c) Advanced therapeutic approaches aim to overcome the limitations of endogenous repair mechanisms. These include:\nAmong these, NSCs stand out as the most therapeutically versatile population due to several distinguishing features. They possess a tripotent differentiation capacity, allowing them to generate neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes—essential for comprehensive neural repair. NSCs are also highly responsive to environmental cues, enabling dynamic adaptation to injury or disease (Pourabdolhossein et al.\nThese features have positioned NSCs as a central focus in neuroregenerative strategies. However, endogenous NSCs in the adult human CNS are largely restricted to specific neurogenic niches and remain predominantly in a quiescent state under physiological conditions. Another major factor is the limited quantity of NSCs in endogenous pools, which may prove insufficient for addressing extensive damage, such as stroke (Bian et al.\nMetabolic imbalances can disrupt nutrient‐sensing pathways crucial for NSC fate and neurogenesis (Fidaleo et al.\nThese challenges underscore the need to develop strategies that can enhance the regenerative potential of endogenous NSCs (Figure\nSome advances in targeting endogenous pools include the use of neurotrophic factors, neutralizing antibodies targeting endogenous molecules within the microenvironment that inhibit CNS repair, gene therapy for cell‐target DNA repair, in situ‐directed reprogramming of CNS cells, and the development of biomaterials to modify the disrupted CNS extracellular matrix (Zamproni et al.\nMoreover, in vivo and in situ neuronal conversion of CNS cells—such as astrocytes (Barker et al.\nTo enhance the limited endogenous repair capacity, various cell types have been transplanted in different neurological conditions.

NSC‐derived EVs offer a compelling cell‐free alternative that retains many of the therapeutic effects of NSCs—such as the delivery of neurotrophic factors, immunomodulators, and even functional mitochondria—while avoiding the risks associated with cell‐based therapies. The following section details the advantages of NSC‐EV‐based biotherapy, including low immunogenicity, BBB penetration, neurotropism, and safety, combined with the functional sophistication of their parental cells, positioning them as a next‐generation regenerative platform for CNS repair.\nEVs represent a potent mechanism of action in various cell transplantation studies. EVs derived from diverse cell sources have been explored for the treatment of various neurological disorders (Putthanbut et al.\nAmong the diverse EV sources explored, those derived from MSCs and NSCs—for some similar reasons that make these cell types attractive in transplantation—are particularly compelling for neurological therapies due to their greater accessibility and well‐established regenerative, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties, rendering them more clinically translatable than EVs from many other CNS‐resident cell types (Hermann et al.\nSummary of current cell‐free therapies based on EVs for neurological disorders.\n↑ cortical layer development; ↑ deep‐layer neurons;\n↑ resilience to cellular stress\n\nAbbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; ANT1/2, adenine nucleotide translocase 1 and 2; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; BAG3, Bcl‐2‐associated athanogene 3; BBB, blood–brain barrier; CNS, central nervous system; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (a mouse model of multiple sclerosis); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EVs, extracellular vesicles; HSPB8, heat shock protein beta‐8; HT22, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line; KO, knockout; LC3B‐II, microtubule‐associated protein 1A/1B‐light chain 3B‐II (autophagy marker); miR, microRNA; MS, multiple sclerosis; MSCs, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; PD, Parkinson's disease; PNI, peripheral nerve injury; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SIRT2, sirtuin 2 (a NAD‐dependent deacetylase); TBI, traumatic brain injury; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; VM, ventral midbrain.\nWhile MSC‐derived EVs offer broad immunomodulatory and regenerative benefits, NSC‐derived EVs stand out for their specialized roles in neurodevelopment and circuit repair, making them particularly promising for neurodegenerative diseases. These EVs possess intrinsic neurogenic potential, are enriched with neurotrophic factors, and have been shown to enhance synaptic plasticity and cognitive function (Volpe et al.\nNSC‐derived EVs offer different therapeutic benefits of NSCs without the complexities of cell transplantation, avoiding issues like cell survival, engraftment, and differentiation. EVs derived from NSCs do not carry the same risks of uncontrolled cell proliferation, tumor formation, or improper integration associated with live cell transplants (Li et al.\nNSC‐derived EVs can protect neurons through enhancing the expression of antioxidant enzymes and reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which rescue mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases (Li et al.\nCollectively, these properties highlight NSC‐derived EVs as a promising cell‐free therapeutic approach, offering neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and regeneration while also having the potential to be used as off‐the‐shelf products, thereby circumventing the challenges associated with direct NSC transplantation.\nAccumulating evidence from preclinical animal studies suggests that NSC‐derived EVs have significant and translatable therapeutic potential, which, with further mechanistic insights, could reshape the current treatment paradigm for neurological conditions, particularly age‐associated CNS disorders. These studies have demonstrated substantial global phenotypic improvement, including immunological, physiological, and behavioral outcomes, in the animal groups treated with NSC‐derived EVs.\nMoreover, preclinical findings suggest that NSC‐derived EVs mitigate key hallmarks of diseases, notably reducing neuroinflammation, lesion volume, neuronal loss, demyelination, and protein aggregation while enhancing neuroprotection, metabolic function, and synaptic activity (Madhu et al.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of action of NSC‐derived EVs can help identify specific molecular targets, enabling their engineering and further enhancing their therapeutic efficacy and potential as biotherapeutic agents. Mechanistic studies show that NSC‐derived EVs offer multiple therapeutic advantages, including modulating neuroinflammation, promoting neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, restoring cellular metabolism, and protecting against neurodegeneration.\nThe potential capacity of NSC‐derived EVs to promote neurogenesis and gliogenesis has fundamental roles for the replacement of cell loss associated with neurodegenerative diseases and also to switch aging‐associated quiescent NSCs to an active status and stimulate the formation of new neurons and glial cells (Ruetz et al.\nIn a study using EVs derived from NSCs, the authors have shown that EVs have the potential to buffer the effect induced by H\nNSC‐derived EVs can also regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation after spinal cord injury via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Upregulating acid‐sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1A) in NSCs raises the activity of prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which causes EVs with high PGE2 levels to be released. These EVs act in a paracrine way and inhibit NSC differentiation into oligodendrocytes. Blocking ASIC1A or PTGS2 reduces PGE2 in EVs, reversing this inhibition and promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation (Wu et al.\nMultimodal mechanisms of action of NSC‐EVs. (a) NSC‐EVs enhance neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation through miRNA‐mediated regulation, ERK signaling, and protection against oxidative stress. They also influence oligodendrocyte differentiation via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling. (b) NSC‐EVs regulate inflammatory responses via various molecular pathways. They transfer IFN‐γ to activate Stat1 signaling in target cells and suppress microglial activation through miRNA‐mediated mechanisms. NSC‐EVs also mitigate inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) via YBX1 and autophagy‐mediated pathways, reducing pro‐inflammatory cytokine expression. (c) NSC‐EVs protect against oxidative stress, preserve mitochondrial function by transferring intact mitochondria, regulate metabolic homeostasis, and counteract neurotoxic astrocyte activation. Additionally, NSC‐EVs suppress microglial reactivity, modulate inflammatory pathways, and mitigate aging‐associated neurodegenerative processes. Together, these multimodal actions highlight the therapeutic potential of NSC‐derived EVs in CNS repair and regeneration. Created by BioRender.\nCurrent studies have demonstrated that NSC‐derived EVs are an important modulator of neuroinflammation, acting through diverse mechanisms in target cells. For example, EVs from NSCs transfer IFN‐γ via Ifngr1 to activate Stat1 signaling and induce specific activation of pro‐inflammatory cytokine signaling in fibroblast cell lines (Cossetti et al.\nIn microglia, EVs from NSCs seemed to exert an anti‐inflammatory role via miRNAs. Accordingly, knockdown of NSC‐derived EV‐enriched miRNAs (including let‐7i, miR‐21a, and miR‐10b) significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of EVs on Aβ‐induced microglial activation in animal models of AD (Gao et al.\nEVs from NSCs can also promote anti‐inflammatory function, regulating the mechanisms of cellular death (Peng et al.\nMoreover, EV treatment increased the expression of the autophagy marker proteins LC3B and beclin‐1 and promoted autophagosome formation in spinal neurons after SCI. This comes together with upregulated expression of the anti‐apoptotic protein Bcl‐2 and reduced expression levels of the pro‐apoptotic protein Bax, the apoptosis effector cleaved caspase‐3 (Rong et al.\nAdditionally, Rong et al. reported that NSC‐derived EV pretreatment inhibits microglial activation (lower number of CD68+ microglia near the injury site) and reduces neuroinflammation, exhibiting lower RNA and protein expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IL‐6). In the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3‐Methyladenine (3MA), all these protective effects of EVs on spinal neurons and microglia were reversed (Rong et al.\nMoreover, hiPSC‐NSC‐EVs have shown promise in mitigating Aβ‐24o‐induced neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo in an AD mouse model by reducing neuroinflammation, amyloid plaques, and tau phosphorylation, leading to improved cognitive and mood functions (Rao et al.\nAll in all, NSC‐derived EVs can modulate neuroinflammation and promote neuronal survival by regulating miRNAs, cell death pathways (such as pyroptosis and apoptosis), and autophagy in models of neurodegenerative diseases and injury (Figure\nOne approach for ameliorating and delaying the progression of aging and the age‐associated neurodegenerative diseases is to promote neuroprotection, that is, an effect that may result in the salvage, recovery, or regeneration of the nervous system, its cells, structure, and function (Vajda\nMost preclinical studies highlight the neuroprotective role of NSC‐derived EVs, with mechanistic studies illustrating how these EVs can mitigate the effects of aging and the hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. As discussed in the previous section, research by Ma et al. and Ocana et al. has already shown the neuroprotective potential of iNSC‐ and NSC‐derived EVs, particularly in oxidative stress conditions that promote cell apoptosis (Ma, Li, et al.\nAnother key aspect of neuroprotection is the regulation of critical nutrient concentrations and the modification of the microenvironment's physiology, which helps support neuronal health and function (Iraci et al.\nFurther to improve microenvironment nutrients, cellular metabolism, and stress tolerance, EVs from NSCs could safeguard cells from neurotoxic substances, such as long‐chain saturated fatty acids secreted by reactive astrocytes (Li, Zhang, et al.\nAnother way NSC‐derived EVs promote neuroprotection is by mitigating hallmarks of the aging process, since many of these neurodegenerative conditions exhibit aging‐associated pathological pathways or are exacerbated by the aging process (Nicaise et al.\nIn an experimental model of brain insulin resistance (BIR)‐dependent cognitive impairment induced by insulin‐resistant NSCs, mice fed a high‐fat diet (HFD) showed reduced NSC proliferation and increased senescence of self‐renewing cells, as assessed by double‐labelling with BrdU and the immature neuron marker DCX (Natale et al.\nCollectively, these studies summarized in Table\nSummary of recent advances in NSC‐derived EV‐based therapies in neurological conditions.\n↑ Dopaminergic neuron survival,\n↓ ROS accumulation, apoptosis, and necrosis; catalase delivery confirmed\nNo significant effect under normal neurogenesis conditions.\nAfter Ara‐C–mediated NPC proliferation inhibition, NPC‐EVs improved neurological scores and reduced infarct volume\nIn vivo: Mouse model of status epilepticus\nIn vitro: macrophage inflammatory model\nIV and\nin vitro OGD/R\n↓ IFNβ, ↓ ELOVL1, ↓ saturated lipids; ↓ astrocyte neurotoxicity; ↓ neuronal apoptosis; motor recovery; ↓ lipid‐induced lipoapoptosis; BBB permeable.\nAlso compared NSC‐EVs with MSC‐EVs in vitro and in vivo; NSC‐EVs demonstrated superior anti‐neurotoxic astrocyte activity\n\nAbbreviations: 3MA, 3‐methyladenine; 5xFAD, transgenic mouse model carrying five familial Alzheimer's disease mutations; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ANT1/2, adenine nucleotide translocase 1 and 2; Ara‐C, cytosine arabinoside; ASIC1A, acid‐sensing ion channel subunit 1A; Aβ, amyloid‐beta peptide; BBB, blood–brain barrier; Beclin‐1, autophagy‐related protein; Catalase, antioxidant enzyme; CNS, central nervous system; COX‐2, cyclooxygenase‐2; E13, embryonic day 13; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ELOVL1, elongation of very long‐chain fatty acids protein 1; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase; EVs, extracellular vesicles; FGF2, fibroblast growth factor 2; FoxO, forkhead box O; GFs, growth factors; GPR30, G‐protein–coupled estrogen receptor 30; hfNSCs, human fetal neural stem cells; hiPSC‐NSCs, human‐induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neural stem cells; HT22, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line; I/R, ischemia–reperfusion; IC, intracerebral; ICV, intracerebroventricular; IFN‐1/IFNβ, interferon type I/beta; IGF2, insulin‐like growth factor 2; IL‐1β, interleukin‐1 beta; IN, intranasal; IRS‐1, insulin receptor substrate 1; KO, knockout; LC3B, microtubule‐associated protein 1A/1B‐light chain 3B (autophagy marker); LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MDA, malondialdehyde; mENPCs, mouse embryonic neural progenitor cells; miNSCs, induced neural stem cells; miR, microRNA; mNPCs, mouse neural progenitor cells; mNSCs, mouse neural stem cells; mSVZ, mouse subventricular zone; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; NLRP3, nucleotide‐binding oligomerization domain‐like receptor protein 3; NPCs, neural progenitor cells; NSPCs, neural stem/progenitor cells; OGD/R, oxygen–glucose deprivation/reperfusion; PD, Parkinson's disease; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; Prdx2, peroxiredoxin‐2; PTGS2, prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX‐2); rfNSCs, rat fetal neural stem cells; rNSCs, rat neural stem cells; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SCI, spinal cord injury; SH‐SY5Y, human neuroblastoma cell line; SPOP, speckle‐type POZ protein; SVZ, subventricular zone; Tau, microtubule‐associated protein tau; tMCAO, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; Txn, thioredoxin; WT, wild‐type; YBX1, Y‐box binding protein 1.\nEncouraged by robust preclinical results, the field is now progressing toward early‐phase clinical trials using NSC‐EVs. However, the transition from bench to bedside remains far from straightforward. Despite their therapeutic promise, NSC‐EVs face substantial technological and regulatory hurdles that limit their clinical translation from bench to market. A key challenge is the large‐scale, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)‐compliant production of NSC‐EVs, constrained by the limited availability of high‐quality NSC sources and the absence of standardized protocols for EV isolation, purification, and characterization. Common methods such as ultracentrifugation and tangential flow filtration often fail to ensure high yield and batch‐to‐batch consistency—both essential for clinical‐grade manufacturing (Sanz‐Ros et al.\nTo overcome these bottlenecks, advances in engineering and biomanufacturing are gaining traction. Techniques such as electroporation, transfection, and membrane fusion are being employed to enhance EV cargo loading, while surface modification with targeting peptides or antibodies improves delivery specificity. These engineering strategies, combined with scalable GMP‐compliant production systems, offer promising solutions to current limitations in yield and targeting (Ma et al.\nA search was performed on\nOngoing clinical trials of iNSC‐derived EVs in neurological disorders.\nThe Safety and Efficacy of NouvSoma001 in Ischemic Stroke\n(\nThe Safety and Efficacy of NouvSoma001 in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders\n(\n\nAbbreviations: EVs, extracellular vesicles; IV, intravenous; NCT, National Clinical Trial (identifier); NMOSD, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder; NouvSoma001, human‐induced NSC‐derived extracellular vesicles; NSC, neural stem cell; Phase I, first‐in‐human clinical trial phase focusing on safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy.\nThe translation of the NSC‐derived EV biotherapeutic approach into clinical practice remains constrained by a range of scientific, technical, and regulatory challenges. Among these are issues related to the standardization of EV production and characterization, heterogeneity, scalability for clinical‐grade manufacturing, delivery across the BBB, and long‐term safety. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of EVs is closely tied to the biological profile of their parental NSCs, making the choice of cell source a critical determinant of success.\nEV characteristics are largely determined by the properties of their parent cells. Selecting an appropriate NSC source requires careful evaluation of several factors, including donor compatibility (autologous vs. allogeneic), tumorigenic factors, population purity and homogeneity, and the specific disease context (focal vs. multifocal or widespread). NSCs can be derived from various regions of the brain or spinal cord, from fetal or adult tissues, or through direct reprogramming of ES or iPS cells—each yielding EVs with distinct molecular signatures and functional capacities. Therefore, NSC source selection must be tailored to the specific neurological condition being targeted.\nHistorically, human NSCs isolated from fetal tissues have been a common source of EVs due to their ability to differentiate into a range of neural lineages and their therapeutic potential (Willis, Nicaise, Peruzzotti‐Jametti, and Pluchino\nFurthermore, EVs derived from NSCs of different brain regions may also vary in their therapeutic effects. For instance, EVs from a human fetal NSC line displayed neuroprotective properties against oxidative stress in vitro, while hypothalamic NSC‐derived EVs demonstrated endocrine‐like effects, influencing neurogenesis and systemic aging in mice (Bonetto and Grilli\nNSC‐derived EVs, even when produced from a similar cell source, represent a highly heterogeneous population with diverse molecular cargo, physical properties, and biological functions—posing significant challenges for their clinical standardization (Peruzzotti‐Jametti et al.\nTo address these limitations, several promising approaches have emerged. First, subpopulation isolation techniques such as microfluidics, size‐exclusion chromatography, and immunoaffinity capture using markers like CD63 or NCAM can help obtain functionally uniform EV subsets for therapeutic use (Zhang, Huang, et al.\nCollectively, these strategies provide a rational roadmap to overcome NSC‐EV heterogeneity and facilitate their safe, consistent, and effective application in CNS therapeutics.\nBeyond the need for production and characterization standardization, optimization of storage and downstream handling is also critical for the clinical translation of NSC‐derived EVs. In relation to optimization of storage conditions, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) recommends that EVs be conserved in isotonic buffers to prevent pH shifts during storage as well as during freezing and thawing procedures and stored at −80°C (Welsh et al.\nTreating CNS diseases with EVs is particularly challenging due to the presence of the BBB; therefore, various delivery methods are currently under investigation. The most effective approach for delivering NSC‐derived EVs across different neurological conditions needs to be optimized in a disease‐specific manner. Common delivery strategies include (a) intranasal administration, which allows rapid CNS absorption; (b) intravascular microbubbles combined with focused ultrasound to transiently open the BBB; (c) oral delivery of plant‐, milk‐, or bacteria‐derived EVs, which have been shown to reach the brain in some studies; (d) intravenous injection, though limited by short circulation time and rapid clearance; (e) intraperitoneal injection, which allows for high local uptake; and (f) subcutaneous injection, which shows minimal brain delivery. More invasive approaches include (g–h) intrathecal or intraventricular injection into the CSF, and (i) direct injection into specific brain regions or tumors (Nieland et al.\nWith advancements in EV isolation and enhanced cell specificity, EVs hold great promise for tissue‐specific applications by enabling targeted therapy delivery, improving treatment efficacy, and minimizing side effects (Zhang, Wu, et al.\nNevertheless, ethical and regulatory challenges remain significant considerations in the development of EV‐based therapies. The ISEV emphasizes that EV therapies are subject to regulations governing “tissues and cells” and “advanced therapy medicinal products” (ATMPs) (Lener et al.\nAltogether, despite the significant promise of NSC‐derived EVs for neurological therapy, several challenges must be addressed before their widespread clinical application. Key challenges include optimizing NSC sources, standardizing EV isolation and characterization, scaling up production while ensuring quality, and evaluating long‐term safety. Refining delivery strategies and advancing EV bioengineering, storage, and regulatory frameworks are essential for translating NSC‐EVs into clinically viable off‐the‐shelf therapies.\nThe CNS has limited regenerative capacity, with NSCs residing in neurogenic zones playing a role in self‐repair. While they hold promise for treating neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, their endogenous repair capacity is often insufficient, particularly with aging, which compromises neurogenesis and contributes to disease progression. Dysfunction within the NSC niche, influenced by inflammation and environmental factors, further limits their regenerative potential. Approaches such as neurotrophic factors, gene therapy, and in vivo glial reprogramming show promise but face clinical challenges.\nNSCs can be sourced from embryonic, fetal, or adult tissues, or reprogrammed from somatic cells. Despite promising preclinical and early clinical data in MS, ALS, and PD, challenges such as ethical concerns, tumorigenicity, and donor compatibility remain. NSC‐derived EVs, serving as a potent mechanism of action in NSC therapy, represent a promising cell‐free biotherapeutic approach due to their intrinsic neurogenic potential, offering advantages over cell therapy such as reduced immunogenicity and enhanced targeting capabilities. They provide neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and metabolic support, promoting neural regeneration in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases.\nPreclinical studies show that NSC‐EVs can mitigate neurodegeneration, reduce oxidative stress, and support mitochondrial function—modulating multiple pathways critical to CNS repair. Ongoing clinical trials underscore their potential as scalable, off‐the‐shelf therapeutics for stroke and neuroimmune disorders. However, translating NSC‐EVs into clinical therapies will require significant progress in optimizing delivery strategies, refining bioengineering approaches, and establishing comprehensive safety profiles. Key challenges include minimizing EV heterogeneity and off‐target effects, ensuring the long‐term safety of repeated administration, and eliminating unintended cargo such as oncogenic miRNAs or pro‐inflammatory cytokines. Clinical success will depend on a coordinated, multidisciplinary effort—integrating advanced bioengineering, standardized analytical methods, rigorous safety testing, and harmonized global regulatory frameworks. Central to this progress will be the development of GMP‐compliant manufacturing processes, validated potency assays, and clear regulatory pathways tailored to the unique complexity of NSC‐EV‐based therapeutics. Ultimately, bridging the fields of neural stem cell biology, nanotechnology, and clinical neuroscience will be crucial to unlock the full therapeutic potential of NSC‐EVs and bring transformative treatments to patients with currently untreatable neurological diseases.\n\nDuring the preparation of this work the authors used ChatGPT to check the grammar.

Growing evidence shows that endogenous NSCs in mammals and humans can shift between quiescence and active proliferation, supporting neurogenesis and gliogenesis during inflammatory CNS disorders (Martino and Pluchino\nRecent studies on inflammatory CNS disorders suggest that dysfunction within the microenvironmental niches where NSCs reside may be responsible for their inability to achieve full restoration (Pluchino et al.\nVarious regenerative approaches have been explored to prevent disease progression and enhance repair mechanisms by targeting the CNS microenvironment. Therapies that can directly or indirectly target the niche microenvironment to restore NSC behavior and promote neuronal regeneration could have a significant impact on the treatment of inflammatory CNS disorders (Martino and Pluchino\nNSCs exert many of their biological effects through their secretome, notably via EVs—nano‐ to micro‐sized, lipid bilayer‐enclosed particles that are secreted by cells and lack replication capacity (Welsh et al.\nEVs are broadly classified based on size, biogenesis, and composition into three main subtypes: exosomes (30–150 nm), which are formed within the endosomal pathway and released through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane; microvesicles (100–1000 nm), also known as ectosomes, which originate by direct outward budding of the plasma membrane; and apoptotic bodies (50–4000 nm), which are shed from cells undergoing programmed cell death and contain nuclear fragments and organelles (Welsh et al.\nBeyond the canonical subtypes, additional vesicular and non‐vesicular extracellular particles have been described, reflecting the expanding complexity of intercellular communication. These include ARMMS (arrestin domain‐containing protein 1‐mediated microvesicles) involved in Notch signaling; migrasomes, which bud from retraction fibers of migrating cells and mediate tissue remodeling; and exophers, which expel damaged cellular components under stress (Wang et al.\nConsistent with the minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles (MISEV) 2023 guidelines, we avoid using terms such as “\nThe unique and multifunctional ability of EVs to influence multiple biological pathways makes them particularly attractive candidates for addressing the complex pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. By modulating the microenvironment of the CNS, NSC‐derived EVs have emerged as a promising cell‐free biotherapeutic strategy, capable of replicating many of the beneficial effects of NSC transplantation while circumventing challenges related to cell survival, immune rejection, and tumorigenic risk. Particularly compelling is their ability to mediate neuroimmune interactions, promote neural repair, and modulate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. These vesicles have been shown to influence key pathophysiological processes in both neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions, including neuroprotection, immune regulation, synaptic plasticity, and tissue regeneration.\nHere we will explore recent advances in biotherapeutic approaches for treating neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on NSC‐derived EVs. It will delve into their mechanisms of action, particularly their role in modulating inflammatory pathways, neuroprotection, and neurometabolic support, while also discussing recent progress in preclinical and clinical applications. Furthermore, we will critically examine the challenges associated with the clinical translation of NSC‐derived EVs. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to highlight the therapeutic frontiers of NSC‐derived EVs in treating neurodegenerative diseases and advancing neural regeneration.\nIn recent years, several innovative biotherapeutic strategies have emerged to promote neural repair by either activating the brain's intrinsic regenerative capacity or introducing exogenous sources of support. Although significant progress has been made—using neurotrophic factors, neutralizing antibodies, gene therapy, biomaterials, and cell‐based therapies—major challenges remain that limit the clinical translation of these approaches.\nThis section explores both avenues: enhancing endogenous repair mechanisms and employing exogenous interventions to highlight current advances and future directions in CNS regeneration. Finally, the unique advantages of NSC‐derived EVs and their potential to overcome the limitations of existing regenerative strategies will be outlined.\nExperimental studies have identified key populations (Figure\nLimited endogenous repair potential and main strategies for neural regeneration. (a) Main stem cell‐like populations in the adult brain include neural stem cells (NSCs) or ependymal cells (ECs) located in neurogenic niches such as the subventricular zone (SVZ), subgranular zone (SGZ), amygdala, striatum, cortex, and hypothalamus. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are distributed throughout the brain and contribute to myelination and neural repair. Perivascular mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and pericytes reside in the vascular niche, while brain endothelial cells (BECs) within the blood–brain barrier (BBB) exhibit progenitor‐like properties. (b) Endogenous stem cells possess self‐renewal capacity and multipotency, enabling neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Their function is tightly regulated by the microenvironment, including soluble factors (cytokines, neurotrophins), extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying signaling molecules and mitochondria, and neuroimmune interactions. However, their repair capacity is inherently limited and declines with aging, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunctions. (c) Advanced therapeutic approaches aim to overcome the limitations of endogenous repair mechanisms. These include:\nAmong these, NSCs stand out as the most therapeutically versatile population due to several distinguishing features. They possess a tripotent differentiation capacity, allowing them to generate neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes—essential for comprehensive neural repair. NSCs are also highly responsive to environmental cues, enabling dynamic adaptation to injury or disease (Pourabdolhossein et al.\nThese features have positioned NSCs as a central focus in neuroregenerative strategies. However, endogenous NSCs in the adult human CNS are largely restricted to specific neurogenic niches and remain predominantly in a quiescent state under physiological conditions. Another major factor is the limited quantity of NSCs in endogenous pools, which may prove insufficient for addressing extensive damage, such as stroke (Bian et al.\nMetabolic imbalances can disrupt nutrient‐sensing pathways crucial for NSC fate and neurogenesis (Fidaleo et al.\nThese challenges underscore the need to develop strategies that can enhance the regenerative potential of endogenous NSCs (Figure\nSome advances in targeting endogenous pools include the use of neurotrophic factors, neutralizing antibodies targeting endogenous molecules within the microenvironment that inhibit CNS repair, gene therapy for cell‐target DNA repair, in situ‐directed reprogramming of CNS cells, and the development of biomaterials to modify the disrupted CNS extracellular matrix (Zamproni et al.\nMoreover, in vivo and in situ neuronal conversion of CNS cells—such as astrocytes (Barker et al.\nTo enhance the limited endogenous repair capacity, various cell types have been transplanted in different neurological conditions.

NSC‐derived EVs offer a compelling cell‐free alternative that retains many of the therapeutic effects of NSCs—such as the delivery of neurotrophic factors, immunomodulators, and even functional mitochondria—while avoiding the risks associated with cell‐based therapies. The following section details the advantages of NSC‐EV‐based biotherapy, including low immunogenicity, BBB penetration, neurotropism, and safety, combined with the functional sophistication of their parental cells, positioning them as a next‐generation regenerative platform for CNS repair.\nEVs represent a potent mechanism of action in various cell transplantation studies. EVs derived from diverse cell sources have been explored for the treatment of various neurological disorders (Putthanbut et al.\nAmong the diverse EV sources explored, those derived from MSCs and NSCs—for some similar reasons that make these cell types attractive in transplantation—are particularly compelling for neurological therapies due to their greater accessibility and well‐established regenerative, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties, rendering them more clinically translatable than EVs from many other CNS‐resident cell types (Hermann et al.\nSummary of current cell‐free therapies based on EVs for neurological disorders.\n↑ cortical layer development; ↑ deep‐layer neurons;\n↑ resilience to cellular stress\n\nAbbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; ANT1/2, adenine nucleotide translocase 1 and 2; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; BAG3, Bcl‐2‐associated athanogene 3; BBB, blood–brain barrier; CNS, central nervous system; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (a mouse model of multiple sclerosis); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EVs, extracellular vesicles; HSPB8, heat shock protein beta‐8; HT22, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line; KO, knockout; LC3B‐II, microtubule‐associated protein 1A/1B‐light chain 3B‐II (autophagy marker); miR, microRNA; MS, multiple sclerosis; MSCs, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; PD, Parkinson's disease; PNI, peripheral nerve injury; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SIRT2, sirtuin 2 (a NAD‐dependent deacetylase); TBI, traumatic brain injury; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; VM, ventral midbrain.\nWhile MSC‐derived EVs offer broad immunomodulatory and regenerative benefits, NSC‐derived EVs stand out for their specialized roles in neurodevelopment and circuit repair, making them particularly promising for neurodegenerative diseases. These EVs possess intrinsic neurogenic potential, are enriched with neurotrophic factors, and have been shown to enhance synaptic plasticity and cognitive function (Volpe et al.\nNSC‐derived EVs offer different therapeutic benefits of NSCs without the complexities of cell transplantation, avoiding issues like cell survival, engraftment, and differentiation. EVs derived from NSCs do not carry the same risks of uncontrolled cell proliferation, tumor formation, or improper integration associated with live cell transplants (Li et al.\nNSC‐derived EVs can protect neurons through enhancing the expression of antioxidant enzymes and reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which rescue mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases (Li et al.\nCollectively, these properties highlight NSC‐derived EVs as a promising cell‐free therapeutic approach, offering neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and regeneration while also having the potential to be used as off‐the‐shelf products, thereby circumventing the challenges associated with direct NSC transplantation.\nAccumulating evidence from preclinical animal studies suggests that NSC‐derived EVs have significant and translatable therapeutic potential, which, with further mechanistic insights, could reshape the current treatment paradigm for neurological conditions, particularly age‐associated CNS disorders. These studies have demonstrated substantial global phenotypic improvement, including immunological, physiological, and behavioral outcomes, in the animal groups treated with NSC‐derived EVs.\nMoreover, preclinical findings suggest that NSC‐derived EVs mitigate key hallmarks of diseases, notably reducing neuroinflammation, lesion volume, neuronal loss, demyelination, and protein aggregation while enhancing neuroprotection, metabolic function, and synaptic activity (Madhu et al.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of action of NSC‐derived EVs can help identify specific molecular targets, enabling their engineering and further enhancing their therapeutic efficacy and potential as biotherapeutic agents. Mechanistic studies show that NSC‐derived EVs offer multiple therapeutic advantages, including modulating neuroinflammation, promoting neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, restoring cellular metabolism, and protecting against neurodegeneration.\nThe potential capacity of NSC‐derived EVs to promote neurogenesis and gliogenesis has fundamental roles for the replacement of cell loss associated with neurodegenerative diseases and also to switch aging‐associated quiescent NSCs to an active status and stimulate the formation of new neurons and glial cells (Ruetz et al.\nIn a study using EVs derived from NSCs, the authors have shown that EVs have the potential to buffer the effect induced by H\nNSC‐derived EVs can also regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation after spinal cord injury via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Upregulating acid‐sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1A) in NSCs raises the activity of prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which causes EVs with high PGE2 levels to be released. These EVs act in a paracrine way and inhibit NSC differentiation into oligodendrocytes. Blocking ASIC1A or PTGS2 reduces PGE2 in EVs, reversing this inhibition and promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation (Wu et al.\nMultimodal mechanisms of action of NSC‐EVs. (a) NSC‐EVs enhance neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation through miRNA‐mediated regulation, ERK signaling, and protection against oxidative stress. They also influence oligodendrocyte differentiation via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling. (b) NSC‐EVs regulate inflammatory responses via various molecular pathways. They transfer IFN‐γ to activate Stat1 signaling in target cells and suppress microglial activation through miRNA‐mediated mechanisms. NSC‐EVs also mitigate inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) via YBX1 and autophagy‐mediated pathways, reducing pro‐inflammatory cytokine expression. (c) NSC‐EVs protect against oxidative stress, preserve mitochondrial function by transferring intact mitochondria, regulate metabolic homeostasis, and counteract neurotoxic astrocyte activation. Additionally, NSC‐EVs suppress microglial reactivity, modulate inflammatory pathways, and mitigate aging‐associated neurodegenerative processes. Together, these multimodal actions highlight the therapeutic potential of NSC‐derived EVs in CNS repair and regeneration. Created by BioRender.\nCurrent studies have demonstrated that NSC‐derived EVs are an important modulator of neuroinflammation, acting through diverse mechanisms in target cells. For example, EVs from NSCs transfer IFN‐γ via Ifngr1 to activate Stat1 signaling and induce specific activation of pro‐inflammatory cytokine signaling in fibroblast cell lines (Cossetti et al.\nIn microglia, EVs from NSCs seemed to exert an anti‐inflammatory role via miRNAs. Accordingly, knockdown of NSC‐derived EV‐enriched miRNAs (including let‐7i, miR‐21a, and miR‐10b) significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of EVs on Aβ‐induced microglial activation in animal models of AD (Gao et al.\nEVs from NSCs can also promote anti‐inflammatory function, regulating the mechanisms of cellular death (Peng et al.\nMoreover, EV treatment increased the expression of the autophagy marker proteins LC3B and beclin‐1 and promoted autophagosome formation in spinal neurons after SCI. This comes together with upregulated expression of the anti‐apoptotic protein Bcl‐2 and reduced expression levels of the pro‐apoptotic protein Bax, the apoptosis effector cleaved caspase‐3 (Rong et al.\nAdditionally, Rong et al. reported that NSC‐derived EV pretreatment inhibits microglial activation (lower number of CD68+ microglia near the injury site) and reduces neuroinflammation, exhibiting lower RNA and protein expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IL‐6). In the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3‐Methyladenine (3MA), all these protective effects of EVs on spinal neurons and microglia were reversed (Rong et al.\nMoreover, hiPSC‐NSC‐EVs have shown promise in mitigating Aβ‐24o‐induced neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo in an AD mouse model by reducing neuroinflammation, amyloid plaques, and tau phosphorylation, leading to improved cognitive and mood functions (Rao et al.\nAll in all, NSC‐derived EVs can modulate neuroinflammation and promote neuronal survival by regulating miRNAs, cell death pathways (such as pyroptosis and apoptosis), and autophagy in models of neurodegenerative diseases and injury (Figure\nOne approach for ameliorating and delaying the progression of aging and the age‐associated neurodegenerative diseases is to promote neuroprotection, that is, an effect that may result in the salvage, recovery, or regeneration of the nervous system, its cells, structure, and function (Vajda\nMost preclinical studies highlight the neuroprotective role of NSC‐derived EVs, with mechanistic studies illustrating how these EVs can mitigate the effects of aging and the hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. As discussed in the previous section, research by Ma et al. and Ocana et al. has already shown the neuroprotective potential of iNSC‐ and NSC‐derived EVs, particularly in oxidative stress conditions that promote cell apoptosis (Ma, Li, et al.\nAnother key aspect of neuroprotection is the regulation of critical nutrient concentrations and the modification of the microenvironment's physiology, which helps support neuronal health and function (Iraci et al.\nFurther to improve microenvironment nutrients, cellular metabolism, and stress tolerance, EVs from NSCs could safeguard cells from neurotoxic substances, such as long‐chain saturated fatty acids secreted by reactive astrocytes (Li, Zhang, et al.\nAnother way NSC‐derived EVs promote neuroprotection is by mitigating hallmarks of the aging process, since many of these neurodegenerative conditions exhibit aging‐associated pathological pathways or are exacerbated by the aging process (Nicaise et al.\nIn an experimental model of brain insulin resistance (BIR)‐dependent cognitive impairment induced by insulin‐resistant NSCs, mice fed a high‐fat diet (HFD) showed reduced NSC proliferation and increased senescence of self‐renewing cells, as assessed by double‐labelling with BrdU and the immature neuron marker DCX (Natale et al.\nCollectively, these studies summarized in Table\nSummary of recent advances in NSC‐derived EV‐based therapies in neurological conditions.\n↑ Dopaminergic neuron survival,\n↓ ROS accumulation, apoptosis, and necrosis; catalase delivery confirmed\nNo significant effect under normal neurogenesis conditions.\nAfter Ara‐C–mediated NPC proliferation inhibition, NPC‐EVs improved neurological scores and reduced infarct volume\nIn vivo: Mouse model of status epilepticus\nIn vitro: macrophage inflammatory model\nIV and\nin vitro OGD/R\n↓ IFNβ, ↓ ELOVL1, ↓ saturated lipids; ↓ astrocyte neurotoxicity; ↓ neuronal apoptosis; motor recovery; ↓ lipid‐induced lipoapoptosis; BBB permeable.\nAlso compared NSC‐EVs with MSC‐EVs in vitro and in vivo; NSC‐EVs demonstrated superior anti‐neurotoxic astrocyte activity\n\nAbbreviations: 3MA, 3‐methyladenine; 5xFAD, transgenic mouse model carrying five familial Alzheimer's disease mutations; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ANT1/2, adenine nucleotide translocase 1 and 2; Ara‐C, cytosine arabinoside; ASIC1A, acid‐sensing ion channel subunit 1A; Aβ, amyloid‐beta peptide; BBB, blood–brain barrier; Beclin‐1, autophagy‐related protein; Catalase, antioxidant enzyme; CNS, central nervous system; COX‐2, cyclooxygenase‐2; E13, embryonic day 13; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ELOVL1, elongation of very long‐chain fatty acids protein 1; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase; EVs, extracellular vesicles; FGF2, fibroblast growth factor 2; FoxO, forkhead box O; GFs, growth factors; GPR30, G‐protein–coupled estrogen receptor 30; hfNSCs, human fetal neural stem cells; hiPSC‐NSCs, human‐induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neural stem cells; HT22, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line; I/R, ischemia–reperfusion; IC, intracerebral; ICV, intracerebroventricular; IFN‐1/IFNβ, interferon type I/beta; IGF2, insulin‐like growth factor 2; IL‐1β, interleukin‐1 beta; IN, intranasal; IRS‐1, insulin receptor substrate 1; KO, knockout; LC3B, microtubule‐associated protein 1A/1B‐light chain 3B (autophagy marker); LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MDA, malondialdehyde; mENPCs, mouse embryonic neural progenitor cells; miNSCs, induced neural stem cells; miR, microRNA; mNPCs, mouse neural progenitor cells; mNSCs, mouse neural stem cells; mSVZ, mouse subventricular zone; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; NLRP3, nucleotide‐binding oligomerization domain‐like receptor protein 3; NPCs, neural progenitor cells; NSPCs, neural stem/progenitor cells; OGD/R, oxygen–glucose deprivation/reperfusion; PD, Parkinson's disease; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; Prdx2, peroxiredoxin‐2; PTGS2, prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX‐2); rfNSCs, rat fetal neural stem cells; rNSCs, rat neural stem cells; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SCI, spinal cord injury; SH‐SY5Y, human neuroblastoma cell line; SPOP, speckle‐type POZ protein; SVZ, subventricular zone; Tau, microtubule‐associated protein tau; tMCAO, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; Txn, thioredoxin; WT, wild‐type; YBX1, Y‐box binding protein 1.\nEncouraged by robust preclinical results, the field is now progressing toward early‐phase clinical trials using NSC‐EVs. However, the transition from bench to bedside remains far from straightforward. Despite their therapeutic promise, NSC‐EVs face substantial technological and regulatory hurdles that limit their clinical translation from bench to market. A key challenge is the large‐scale, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)‐compliant production of NSC‐EVs, constrained by the limited availability of high‐quality NSC sources and the absence of standardized protocols for EV isolation, purification, and characterization. Common methods such as ultracentrifugation and tangential flow filtration often fail to ensure high yield and batch‐to‐batch consistency—both essential for clinical‐grade manufacturing (Sanz‐Ros et al.\nTo overcome these bottlenecks, advances in engineering and biomanufacturing are gaining traction. Techniques such as electroporation, transfection, and membrane fusion are being employed to enhance EV cargo loading, while surface modification with targeting peptides or antibodies improves delivery specificity. These engineering strategies, combined with scalable GMP‐compliant production systems, offer promising solutions to current limitations in yield and targeting (Ma et al.\nA search was performed on\nOngoing clinical trials of iNSC‐derived EVs in neurological disorders.\nThe Safety and Efficacy of NouvSoma001 in Ischemic Stroke\n(\nThe Safety and Efficacy of NouvSoma001 in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders\n(\n\nAbbreviations: EVs, extracellular vesicles; IV, intravenous; NCT, National Clinical Trial (identifier); NMOSD, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder; NouvSoma001, human‐induced NSC‐derived extracellular vesicles; NSC, neural stem cell; Phase I, first‐in‐human clinical trial phase focusing on safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy.\nThe translation of the NSC‐derived EV biotherapeutic approach into clinical practice remains constrained by a range of scientific, technical, and regulatory challenges. Among these are issues related to the standardization of EV production and characterization, heterogeneity, scalability for clinical‐grade manufacturing, delivery across the BBB, and long‐term safety. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of EVs is closely tied to the biological profile of their parental NSCs, making the choice of cell source a critical determinant of success.\nEV characteristics are largely determined by the properties of their parent cells. Selecting an appropriate NSC source requires careful evaluation of several factors, including donor compatibility (autologous vs. allogeneic), tumorigenic factors, population purity and homogeneity, and the specific disease context (focal vs. multifocal or widespread). NSCs can be derived from various regions of the brain or spinal cord, from fetal or adult tissues, or through direct reprogramming of ES or iPS cells—each yielding EVs with distinct molecular signatures and functional capacities. Therefore, NSC source selection must be tailored to the specific neurological condition being targeted.\nHistorically, human NSCs isolated from fetal tissues have been a common source of EVs due to their ability to differentiate into a range of neural lineages and their therapeutic potential (Willis, Nicaise, Peruzzotti‐Jametti, and Pluchino\nFurthermore, EVs derived from NSCs of different brain regions may also vary in their therapeutic effects. For instance, EVs from a human fetal NSC line displayed neuroprotective properties against oxidative stress in vitro, while hypothalamic NSC‐derived EVs demonstrated endocrine‐like effects, influencing neurogenesis and systemic aging in mice (Bonetto and Grilli\nNSC‐derived EVs, even when produced from a similar cell source, represent a highly heterogeneous population with diverse molecular cargo, physical properties, and biological functions—posing significant challenges for their clinical standardization (Peruzzotti‐Jametti et al.\nTo address these limitations, several promising approaches have emerged. First, subpopulation isolation techniques such as microfluidics, size‐exclusion chromatography, and immunoaffinity capture using markers like CD63 or NCAM can help obtain functionally uniform EV subsets for therapeutic use (Zhang, Huang, et al.\nCollectively, these strategies provide a rational roadmap to overcome NSC‐EV heterogeneity and facilitate their safe, consistent, and effective application in CNS therapeutics.\nBeyond the need for production and characterization standardization, optimization of storage and downstream handling is also critical for the clinical translation of NSC‐derived EVs. In relation to optimization of storage conditions, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) recommends that EVs be conserved in isotonic buffers to prevent pH shifts during storage as well as during freezing and thawing procedures and stored at −80°C (Welsh et al.\nTreating CNS diseases with EVs is particularly challenging due to the presence of the BBB; therefore, various delivery methods are currently under investigation. The most effective approach for delivering NSC‐derived EVs across different neurological conditions needs to be optimized in a disease‐specific manner. Common delivery strategies include (a) intranasal administration, which allows rapid CNS absorption; (b) intravascular microbubbles combined with focused ultrasound to transiently open the BBB; (c) oral delivery of plant‐, milk‐, or bacteria‐derived EVs, which have been shown to reach the brain in some studies; (d) intravenous injection, though limited by short circulation time and rapid clearance; (e) intraperitoneal injection, which allows for high local uptake; and (f) subcutaneous injection, which shows minimal brain delivery. More invasive approaches include (g–h) intrathecal or intraventricular injection into the CSF, and (i) direct injection into specific brain regions or tumors (Nieland et al.\nWith advancements in EV isolation and enhanced cell specificity, EVs hold great promise for tissue‐specific applications by enabling targeted therapy delivery, improving treatment efficacy, and minimizing side effects (Zhang, Wu, et al.\nNevertheless, ethical and regulatory challenges remain significant considerations in the development of EV‐based therapies. The ISEV emphasizes that EV therapies are subject to regulations governing “tissues and cells” and “advanced therapy medicinal products” (ATMPs) (Lener et al.\nAltogether, despite the significant promise of NSC‐derived EVs for neurological therapy, several challenges must be addressed before their widespread clinical application. Key challenges include optimizing NSC sources, standardizing EV isolation and characterization, scaling up production while ensuring quality, and evaluating long‐term safety. Refining delivery strategies and advancing EV bioengineering, storage, and regulatory frameworks are essential for translating NSC‐EVs into clinically viable off‐the‐shelf therapies.\nThe CNS has limited regenerative capacity, with NSCs residing in neurogenic zones playing a role in self‐repair. While they hold promise for treating neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, their endogenous repair capacity is often insufficient, particularly with aging, which compromises neurogenesis and contributes to disease progression. Dysfunction within the NSC niche, influenced by inflammation and environmental factors, further limits their regenerative potential. Approaches such as neurotrophic factors, gene therapy, and in vivo glial reprogramming show promise but face clinical challenges.\nNSCs can be sourced from embryonic, fetal, or adult tissues, or reprogrammed from somatic cells. Despite promising preclinical and early clinical data in MS, ALS, and PD, challenges such as ethical concerns, tumorigenicity, and donor compatibility remain. NSC‐derived EVs, serving as a potent mechanism of action in NSC therapy, represent a promising cell‐free biotherapeutic approach due to their intrinsic neurogenic potential, offering advantages over cell therapy such as reduced immunogenicity and enhanced targeting capabilities. They provide neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and metabolic support, promoting neural regeneration in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases.\nPreclinical studies show that NSC‐EVs can mitigate neurodegeneration, reduce oxidative stress, and support mitochondrial function—modulating multiple pathways critical to CNS repair. Ongoing clinical trials underscore their potential as scalable, off‐the‐shelf therapeutics for stroke and neuroimmune disorders. However, translating NSC‐EVs into clinical therapies will require significant progress in optimizing delivery strategies, refining bioengineering approaches, and establishing comprehensive safety profiles. Key challenges include minimizing EV heterogeneity and off‐target effects, ensuring the long‐term safety of repeated administration, and eliminating unintended cargo such as oncogenic miRNAs or pro‐inflammatory cytokines. Clinical success will depend on a coordinated, multidisciplinary effort—integrating advanced bioengineering, standardized analytical methods, rigorous safety testing, and harmonized global regulatory frameworks. Central to this progress will be the development of GMP‐compliant manufacturing processes, validated potency assays, and clear regulatory pathways tailored to the unique complexity of NSC‐EV‐based therapeutics. Ultimately, bridging the fields of neural stem cell biology, nanotechnology, and clinical neuroscience will be crucial to unlock the full therapeutic potential of NSC‐EVs and bring transformative treatments to patients with currently untreatable neurological diseases.\n\nDuring the preparation of this work the authors used ChatGPT to check the grammar.

These processes occur in specific cellular structures, such as the secretory granule membrane and microvillus membrane, which are crucial for immune function. Furthermore, the diversity of MFs in IBS, including key molecular activities in immune recognition and signal transduction, further emphasizes the complexity of immune regulation and cell-to-cell communication involved in the disease.\nKEGG enrichment analysis suggests that the pathophysiology of IBS involves the activation of the immune system, intercellular signal transmission, and the regulation of metabolic pathways.

Subsequently, we performed a topological analysis of these proteins using Cytoscape software (version 3.10.1). During the analysis, we screened out 19 core proteins based on the criterion of a degree greater than or equal to 10 (\nLeveraging the TCMSP database and the Herb database, we searched for active compounds that interact with these 19 core proteins. After filtering based on the criteria of OB ≥30%, DL ≥0.18, and HL ≥4 h, we retained 13 active compounds corresponding to 204 traditional Chinese medicines related to eight core proteins.

The smaller the deviation, the better the conformational stability. Therefore, the equilibrium of the simulation system was assessed using RMSD (\nFurther analysis revealed that the radius of gyration (Rg) and the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of the CD74-quercetin, TP53-wogonin, JUN-berberine, NT5E-quercetin, and TP53-berberine complexes fluctuated stably during the motion, indicating that the target protein-small molecule complexes remained stable and compact throughout the simulation process (\nHydrogen bonds play a significant role in the binding of ligands to proteins.

These processes occur in specific cellular structures, such as the secretory granule membrane and microvillus membrane, which are crucial for immune function. Furthermore, the diversity of MFs in IBS, including key molecular activities in immune recognition and signal transduction, further emphasizes the complexity of immune regulation and cell-to-cell communication involved in the disease.\nKEGG enrichment analysis suggests that the pathophysiology of IBS involves the activation of the immune system, intercellular signal transmission, and the regulation of metabolic pathways. The interaction between viral proteins and cytokines and receptors, cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, B-cell signaling pathways, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways are all potential etiological factors of IBS.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding through the gastrointestinal tract leads to epithelial barrier damage, immune activation, changes in microbiota composition, dysregulation of the serotonin pathway, and intestinal neuropathy, which may be significant factors contributing to the high incidence of IBS in patients during acute infection and postrecovery [\nBased on the results of KEGG enrichment analysis, there may be a causal link between the B-cell signaling pathway and IBS.

Systematic reviews and network pharmacology studies suggest that wogonin, as one of the key chemical metabolites in traditional Chinese medicine formulations, may have potential therapeutic effects on IBS-D and its associated anxiety and depressive symptoms [\nPAC, also known as Guan Huang Bai, originates from the bark of\nDespite employing various statistical methods to enhance the robustness of our research findings, such as conducting pleiotropy tests and heterogeneity tests to confirm the reliability of the results, our study still faces some notable limitations. First, our research only covered pQTL data for 2941 proteins, which may limit our ability to identify a broader range of protein expression variations. Second, the IBS samples we selected were predominantly from European populations, raising questions about the generalizability of our findings to other races or ethnic groups. In the network pharmacology section, we chose proteins with a degree value of 10 or higher based on topological analysis and applied stringent selection criteria for the active compounds interacting with these proteins, which may have led to the omission of some compounds that could be effective in treating IBS. Lastly, and most critically, our conclusions are based on predictions of causal relationships and database analyses, which require further experimental validation for support.\nOur research integrates proteomics data and explores the possible etiology of IBS from a causal perspective. Additionally, we have newly discovered the potential of PAC and ABR, two traditional Chinese medicines, in treating IBS, as well as potential therapeutic targets.

In a phase 1 trial involving 52 healthy induviduals and 9 individuals with hepatic steatosis, ARO-AGN3 produced substantial and sustained reductions in serum ANGPTL3 concentrations of up to 92.7% from baseline in healthy individuals. Meanwhile, serum TG and atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL-C, non-HDL-C and VLDL-C) also decreased. ARO-AGN3 similarly reduced atherogenic lipoproteins in a small subset of participants with hepatic steatosis, and no increase in liver fat was observed with repeated dosing. In addition, ARO-ANG3 demonstrated durable pharmacological effects that lasted >3 months after the current administration. Injection-site reactions were the most common adverse events (NCT no. 03747224) (\nANGPTL8 is a cofactor for the efficacy of ANGPTL3, which can synergistically inhibit LPL activity by promoting the molecular cleavage of ANGPTL3 and forming an ANGPTL3/8 complex by binding to the N terminus of ANGPTL3, thereby increasing TG levels (\nApoC3 can increase plasma TG levels by reducing LPL activity, inhibiting the clearance of TG from the circulation and promoting the secretion of hepatic VLDL into plasma (\nVolanesorsen, the first ASO RNA drug to be developed against ApoC3 (2′-O-methoxyethyl-modified ASO), is available in the European Union and the United Kingdom (\nOlezarsen, an ASO conjugated to GalNac, is another form of volanesorsen and is currently applying for marketing in the United States (\nPlozasiran (also known as ARO-APOC3) is a GalNac-conjugated siRNA targeting ApoC3 mRNA in hepatocytes (\nLp (a) is considered to be an independent risk factor for ASCVD and calcific aortic stenosis (\nPelacarsen, also known as AKCEA-Apo(a)-LRx or TQJ230, is an ASO that binds GalNac to target APO(a) mRNA in hepatocytes (\nOlpasiran (AMG-890) is an siRNA that targets Apo(a) (\nZerlasiran (SLN360) is also an siRNA targeting Apo(a). In a recent phase 2 trial of Zerlasiran, 178 patients with ASCVD with high Lp (a) levels who were treated with zerlasiran or matching placebo had a mean reduction in Lp (a) levels of >80% at week 36 in the zerlasiran group, as compared with the placebo group. The most common adverse events were mild injection site reactions (NCT no. 05537571) (\nMuvalaplin (LY3473329) is the first small molecule drug in the world to enter phase 2 clinical trials, which can effectively lower Lp (a) (\nAdvancements in science and technology have allowed for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying dyslipidemia. This allows for the development of new biotherapies specifically targeting molecules of core metabolic importance. Lipid-lowering therapies carry out a central role in the prevention of ASCVD. The main existing lipid-lowering medications include statins, ezetimibe, BAS, monoclonal antibodies that inhibit PSCK9, mipomersen, lomitapide and ω-3 fatty acids. Even when used in combination, they cannot meet current clinical needs due to various reasons such as intolerance, applicable populations and adverse reactions. Combining new therapeutic drugs, such as inclisiran, hyzetimibe, bempedoic acid, CETP inhibitors, ANGPTL3 inhibitors, ANGPTL3/8 complex inhibitors, ApoC3 inhibitors and Apo(a) inhibitors, with existing lipid-lowering medications, may help to meet the unmet clinical needs. Additionally, a reasonable dietary structure and appropriate exercise may help improve lipid levels and promote overall health, and the development of drugs targeting relevant points on the microbiome-gut-brain axis also demonstrates potential for therapeutic application.", "topic": "Social_neurology"}
