increasing attention, particularly in the context of inflammatory and genetic markers that influence disease progression. IL‐9 has been identified as a key regulator that functions to promote the activation of neuroglial cells, boosting their capacity to phagocytose and clear Aβ deposits, which helps in limiting the formation of amyloid plaques. Furthermore, IL‐9 plays a role in altering the permeability of the blood–brain barrier, potentially allowing peripheral immune cells to enter the brain and thereby modulating the local inflammatory landscape.\nSimilarly, differences in chemokine and cytokine levels have been observed in\nIL‐8 presents a complex role, functioning as both a neuroprotective and neurodegenerative factor. The significant decrease in IL‐8 levels observed among AAs\nMeanwhile, IL‐10 serves an essential role in controlling neuroinflammation and the formation of amyloid plaques in AD, with both genetic and functional studies underscoring its importance. Genetic polymorphisms in the IL‐10 gene promoter region have been associated with varying susceptibility to AD, where reduced IL‐10 expression is linked to increased inflammatory responses and a greater risk of disease development.\nBeyond cytokines, genetic predisposition plays a significant role in AD susceptibility among individuals of African descent. IgG3 allotype GM6 expressed exclusively in people of African descent is recognized as associated risk of developing AD.\nThe exact mechanisms by which\nBDNF, due to its critical role in neuronal development and survival, also offers a key functional candidate gene for AD. BDNF also serves as a neurotransmitter modulator and is essential for neuronal plasticity, which supports learning and memory processes. Again, BDNF has been shown to promote the survival of dopaminergic neurons, which are affected in PD, and also seen to play significant role in protecting striatal neurons from degeneration, which is a hallmark of Huntington's disease.\nAlthough research on biomarkers related to PD in Africa exists, few studies have explored the association between inflammatory markers and PD among individuals of African ancestry or within the African region. Evidence from a study conducted in South African mixed ancestry suggests immune process dysregulation in PD, with PD status showing significantly elevated IL‐6 levels and lower CRP levels after adjusting for sex.\nMany inflammatory cytokines in association with MS have not been studied in the African ancestry. IL‐9 has, however, been identified as a vital molecule for protecting the nervous system, with the ability to counteract inflammatory damage to synapses.\nGenetic factors influencing MS have been linked to the human leukocyte antigen‐haplotype gene (\nCSF has been the most frequently used sample for measuring cytokines and immune markers in MS, particularly in studies emphasizing humoral immune mediation as a key factor. To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both humoral and cellular immune responses in MS pathogenesis within populations of African ancestry, further exploration of additional samples with diverse inflammatory markers is recommended.\nExtensive research has explored the association among cytokines, immune markers, and cognition across diverse racial groups. Plasma levels of BDNF in AA and Blacks have been found to be significantly linked to complex attention and processing speed,\nThe relationship between specific inflammatory biomarkers and cognitive function has been examined in AAs and EAs with common vascular risk factors. Among AAs, elevated soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR)2 levels were linked to poorer cognitive performance across multiple domains, including global cognition, processing speed, language, memory, and executive function.\nThe pronounced adverse associations between inflammation and cognitive function among AAs have been examined, with a particular focus on markers of TNF‐α activity. While TNF‐α has demonstrated significant links to cognition in some studies,\nThe hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory and learning, serves as a key indicator of cognitive function. No associations have been reported between IL‐6 or CRP and hippocampal volume.\nResearch examining systemic inflammation and cognitive performance among AAs and White urban adults has indicated that IL‐6 is not associated with better baseline performance in verbal and working memory tests among AAs compared to Whites.\nStrong associations have been observed between systemic inflammation and longitudinal cognitive performance, particularly among older individuals (> 50 years) and AAs.\nReports on IL‐8 and its interaction with race in cognitive performance tests have shown inconsistencies. While some findings indicate a stronger association between IL‐8 and cognitive performance in AAs compared to Caucasians,\nFew studies have examined the association among cytokines, immune markers, and dementia among individuals of African ancestry. Research involving demented and non‐demented Congolese Africans has shown no significant differences in inflammatory marker concentrations, including IL‐1β, IL‐10, and TNF‐α, across age and sex.\nAmong the inflammatory cytokines reviewed in relation to cognition across racial groups, IL‐6 has received considerable focus. Findings on IL‐6 and its association with inflammation and race in cognitive function have been mixed, with some studies reporting significant interactions while others found no association. These inconsistencies may be influenced by factors such as environmental, genetic, and lifestyle variations, as well as differences in study design and target populations. Although some studies found no association between race and IL‐6 in cognitive function, the overall findings align with established research linking IL‐6 to cognitive decline. Additionally, IL‐6 has been correlated with AD, PD, and dementia, reinforcing its role as a pro‐inflammatory marker in neurodegenerative diseases, including those affecting individuals of African ancestry.\nsTNFR1, plasma levels of BDNF, and IL‐8 have been identified as risk markers for cognitive impairment in studies examining their association with cognition among individuals of African ancestry, despite limited research on these biomarkers. Further studies, particularly within the African region, are recommended to better understand their roles and effects on cognition. Additionally, across various studies, IL‐8 has been consistently correlated with neurodegeneration among individuals of African ancestry, reinforcing its significant role in disease pathology.\nNew insights into the genetic predisposition of inflammatory markers for AD have emerged from studies on African ancestry. Research on the IgG index (GM3, GM6) as a humoral mediation response in neurodegeneration and cognition has revealed significant interactions. The presence of the HLA‐C allele alongside GM3 has been associated with a 4‐fold increase in the likelihood of developing AD. Additionally, the risk of developing AD linked to GM6 positivity differs between non‐FCGRIIB TT participants and FCGRIIB TT participants, with non‐FCGRIIB TT individuals experiencing more than twice the likelihood of developing AD when GM6 positive compared to GM6 negative. Significant associations have also been identified between FCGRIIB rs1050501 genotypes and time to AD development in AA cohorts, but not in EA cohorts. Furthermore, genetic variants of TREM2 have been found to influence AD‐related inflammation, with TREM2 coding variants being linked to an increased risk of late‐onset AD in African ancestry. These findings highlight the potential for further research into the genetic predisposition of inflammatory markers in neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive function.\nThis review highlights important clinical implications for populations of African ancestry, particularly in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The identified inflammatory markers offer potential as cost‐effective, less‐invasive screening tools for early detection of individuals at risk for cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, these findings support the exploration of therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating inflammation, particularly during the early stages of AD, PD, and MS. Targeted interventions, such as IL‐6 inhibition or IL‐10 enhancement, could help mitigate neuroinflammation and slow disease progression.\nFuture research should prioritize long‐term observational studies to better understand the role of inflammation in cognitive decline and neurodegeneration among diverse African populations. Expanding studies with larger sample sizes and more standardized methods for measuring biomarkers will further refine diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies. Ultimately, integrating these findings into clinical practice can help address health disparities by informing culturally and genetically tailored approaches to neurodegenerative disease management within African and African ancestry populations.\nDespite using a comprehensive search across multiple databases, relevant studies indexed in less accessible or regional databases may have been missed. The selection criteria emphasized peer‐reviewed articles published in English, which may have led to the exclusion of potentially valuable studies in other languages. This introduces a risk of language bias, especially considering that studies conducted in African countries may be published in other languages.\nThis review highlights the complex interplay among inflammatory cytokines, immune markers, and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD, PD, MS, and cognitive decline among populations of African ancestry. The evidence suggests significant ethnic variations in the association between these biomarkers and cognitive outcomes, emphasizing the need for population‐specific research. Key findings indicate that elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as IL‐6, IL‐1β, and sTNFRs are linked to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration, while the role of IL‐10 and IL‐8 present varying associations based on demographic factors. Studies suggest that genetic predispositions such as\nDespite some inconsistencies in the findings, particularly regarding the impact of race on inflammation and cognition, the overall trend highlights the importance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Long‐term observational research involving inflammation and the progression of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration should be conducted among participants from various ethnic groups within Africa, as this will help identify population‐specific patterns and disparities. By elucidating these relationships, we can inform diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for affected individuals of African descent.\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.

increasing attention, particularly in the context of inflammatory and genetic markers that influence disease progression. IL‐9 has been identified as a key regulator that functions to promote the activation of neuroglial cells, boosting their capacity to phagocytose and clear Aβ deposits, which helps in limiting the formation of amyloid plaques. Furthermore, IL‐9 plays a role in altering the permeability of the blood–brain barrier, potentially allowing peripheral immune cells to enter the brain and thereby modulating the local inflammatory landscape.\nSimilarly, differences in chemokine and cytokine levels have been observed in\nIL‐8 presents a complex role, functioning as both a neuroprotective and neurodegenerative factor. The significant decrease in IL‐8 levels observed among AAs\nMeanwhile, IL‐10 serves an essential role in controlling neuroinflammation and the formation of amyloid plaques in AD, with both genetic and functional studies underscoring its importance. Genetic polymorphisms in the IL‐10 gene promoter region have been associated with varying susceptibility to AD, where reduced IL‐10 expression is linked to increased inflammatory responses and a greater risk of disease development.\nBeyond cytokines, genetic predisposition plays a significant role in AD susceptibility among individuals of African descent. IgG3 allotype GM6 expressed exclusively in people of African descent is recognized as associated risk of developing AD.\nThe exact mechanisms by which\nBDNF, due to its critical role in neuronal development and survival, also offers a key functional candidate gene for AD. BDNF also serves as a neurotransmitter modulator and is essential for neuronal plasticity, which supports learning and memory processes. Again, BDNF has been shown to promote the survival of dopaminergic neurons, which are affected in PD, and also seen to play significant role in protecting striatal neurons from degeneration, which is a hallmark of Huntington's disease.\nAlthough research on biomarkers related to PD in Africa exists, few studies have explored the association between inflammatory markers and PD among individuals of African ancestry or within the African region. Evidence from a study conducted in South African mixed ancestry suggests immune process dysregulation in PD, with PD status showing significantly elevated IL‐6 levels and lower CRP levels after adjusting for sex.\nMany inflammatory cytokines in association with MS have not been studied in the African ancestry. IL‐9 has, however, been identified as a vital molecule for protecting the nervous system, with the ability to counteract inflammatory damage to synapses.\nGenetic factors influencing MS have been linked to the human leukocyte antigen‐haplotype gene (\nCSF has been the most frequently used sample for measuring cytokines and immune markers in MS, particularly in studies emphasizing humoral immune mediation as a key factor. To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both humoral and cellular immune responses in MS pathogenesis within populations of African ancestry, further exploration of additional samples with diverse inflammatory markers is recommended.\nExtensive research has explored the association among cytokines, immune markers, and cognition across diverse racial groups. Plasma levels of BDNF in AA and Blacks have been found to be significantly linked to complex attention and processing speed,\nThe relationship between specific inflammatory biomarkers and cognitive function has been examined in AAs and EAs with common vascular risk factors. Among AAs, elevated soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR)2 levels were linked to poorer cognitive performance across multiple domains, including global cognition, processing speed, language, memory, and executive function.\nThe pronounced adverse associations between inflammation and cognitive function among AAs have been examined, with a particular focus on markers of TNF‐α activity. While TNF‐α has demonstrated significant links to cognition in some studies,\nThe hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory and learning, serves as a key indicator of cognitive function. No associations have been reported between IL‐6 or CRP and hippocampal volume.\nResearch examining systemic inflammation and cognitive performance among AAs and White urban adults has indicated that IL‐6 is not associated with better baseline performance in verbal and working memory tests among AAs compared to Whites.\nStrong associations have been observed between systemic inflammation and longitudinal cognitive performance, particularly among older individuals (> 50 years) and AAs.\nReports on IL‐8 and its interaction with race in cognitive performance tests have shown inconsistencies. While some findings indicate a stronger association between IL‐8 and cognitive performance in AAs compared to Caucasians,\nFew studies have examined the association among cytokines, immune markers, and dementia among individuals of African ancestry. Research involving demented and non‐demented Congolese Africans has shown no significant differences in inflammatory marker concentrations, including IL‐1β, IL‐10, and TNF‐α, across age and sex.\nAmong the inflammatory cytokines reviewed in relation to cognition across racial groups, IL‐6 has received considerable focus. Findings on IL‐6 and its association with inflammation and race in cognitive function have been mixed, with some studies reporting significant interactions while others found no association. These inconsistencies may be influenced by factors such as environmental, genetic, and lifestyle variations, as well as differences in study design and target populations. Although some studies found no association between race and IL‐6 in cognitive function, the overall findings align with established research linking IL‐6 to cognitive decline. Additionally, IL‐6 has been correlated with AD, PD, and dementia, reinforcing its role as a pro‐inflammatory marker in neurodegenerative diseases, including those affecting individuals of African ancestry.\nsTNFR1, plasma levels of BDNF, and IL‐8 have been identified as risk markers for cognitive impairment in studies examining their association with cognition among individuals of African ancestry, despite limited research on these biomarkers. Further studies, particularly within the African region, are recommended to better understand their roles and effects on cognition. Additionally, across various studies, IL‐8 has been consistently correlated with neurodegeneration among individuals of African ancestry, reinforcing its significant role in disease pathology.\nNew insights into the genetic predisposition of inflammatory markers for AD have emerged from studies on African ancestry. Research on the IgG index (GM3, GM6) as a humoral mediation response in neurodegeneration and cognition has revealed significant interactions. The presence of the HLA‐C allele alongside GM3 has been associated with a 4‐fold increase in the likelihood of developing AD. Additionally, the risk of developing AD linked to GM6 positivity differs between non‐FCGRIIB TT participants and FCGRIIB TT participants, with non‐FCGRIIB TT individuals experiencing more than twice the likelihood of developing AD when GM6 positive compared to GM6 negative. Significant associations have also been identified between FCGRIIB rs1050501 genotypes and time to AD development in AA cohorts, but not in EA cohorts. Furthermore, genetic variants of TREM2 have been found to influence AD‐related inflammation, with TREM2 coding variants being linked to an increased risk of late‐onset AD in African ancestry. These findings highlight the potential for further research into the genetic predisposition of inflammatory markers in neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive function.\nThis review highlights important clinical implications for populations of African ancestry, particularly in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The identified inflammatory markers offer potential as cost‐effective, less‐invasive screening tools for early detection of individuals at risk for cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, these findings support the exploration of therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating inflammation, particularly during the early stages of AD, PD, and MS. Targeted interventions, such as IL‐6 inhibition or IL‐10 enhancement, could help mitigate neuroinflammation and slow disease progression.\nFuture research should prioritize long‐term observational studies to better understand the role of inflammation in cognitive decline and neurodegeneration among diverse African populations. Expanding studies with larger sample sizes and more standardized methods for measuring biomarkers will further refine diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies. Ultimately, integrating these findings into clinical practice can help address health disparities by informing culturally and genetically tailored approaches to neurodegenerative disease management within African and African ancestry populations.\nDespite using a comprehensive search across multiple databases, relevant studies indexed in less accessible or regional databases may have been missed. The selection criteria emphasized peer‐reviewed articles published in English, which may have led to the exclusion of potentially valuable studies in other languages. This introduces a risk of language bias, especially considering that studies conducted in African countries may be published in other languages.\nThis review highlights the complex interplay among inflammatory cytokines, immune markers, and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD, PD, MS, and cognitive decline among populations of African ancestry. The evidence suggests significant ethnic variations in the association between these biomarkers and cognitive outcomes, emphasizing the need for population‐specific research. Key findings indicate that elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as IL‐6, IL‐1β, and sTNFRs are linked to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration, while the role of IL‐10 and IL‐8 present varying associations based on demographic factors. Studies suggest that genetic predispositions such as\nDespite some inconsistencies in the findings, particularly regarding the impact of race on inflammation and cognition, the overall trend highlights the importance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Long‐term observational research involving inflammation and the progression of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration should be conducted among participants from various ethnic groups within Africa, as this will help identify population‐specific patterns and disparities. By elucidating these relationships, we can inform diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for affected individuals of African descent.\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.

Growing evidence shows that endogenous NSCs in mammals and humans can shift between quiescence and active proliferation, supporting neurogenesis and gliogenesis during inflammatory CNS disorders (Martino and Pluchino\nRecent studies on inflammatory CNS disorders suggest that dysfunction within the microenvironmental niches where NSCs reside may be responsible for their inability to achieve full restoration (Pluchino et al.\nVarious regenerative approaches have been explored to prevent disease progression and enhance repair mechanisms by targeting the CNS microenvironment. Therapies that can directly or indirectly target the niche microenvironment to restore NSC behavior and promote neuronal regeneration could have a significant impact on the treatment of inflammatory CNS disorders (Martino and Pluchino\nNSCs exert many of their biological effects through their secretome, notably via EVs—nano‐ to micro‐sized, lipid bilayer‐enclosed particles that are secreted by cells and lack replication capacity (Welsh et al.\nEVs are broadly classified based on size, biogenesis, and composition into three main subtypes: exosomes (30–150 nm), which are formed within the endosomal pathway and released through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane; microvesicles (100–1000 nm), also known as ectosomes, which originate by direct outward budding of the plasma membrane; and apoptotic bodies (50–4000 nm), which are shed from cells undergoing programmed cell death and contain nuclear fragments and organelles (Welsh et al.\nBeyond the canonical subtypes, additional vesicular and non‐vesicular extracellular particles have been described, reflecting the expanding complexity of intercellular communication. These include ARMMS (arrestin domain‐containing protein 1‐mediated microvesicles) involved in Notch signaling; migrasomes, which bud from retraction fibers of migrating cells and mediate tissue remodeling; and exophers, which expel damaged cellular components under stress (Wang et al.\nConsistent with the minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles (MISEV) 2023 guidelines, we avoid using terms such as “\nThe unique and multifunctional ability of EVs to influence multiple biological pathways makes them particularly attractive candidates for addressing the complex pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. By modulating the microenvironment of the CNS, NSC‐derived EVs have emerged as a promising cell‐free biotherapeutic strategy, capable of replicating many of the beneficial effects of NSC transplantation while circumventing challenges related to cell survival, immune rejection, and tumorigenic risk. Particularly compelling is their ability to mediate neuroimmune interactions, promote neural repair, and modulate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. These vesicles have been shown to influence key pathophysiological processes in both neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions, including neuroprotection, immune regulation, synaptic plasticity, and tissue regeneration.\nHere we will explore recent advances in biotherapeutic approaches for treating neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on NSC‐derived EVs. It will delve into their mechanisms of action, particularly their role in modulating inflammatory pathways, neuroprotection, and neurometabolic support, while also discussing recent progress in preclinical and clinical applications. Furthermore, we will critically examine the challenges associated with the clinical translation of NSC‐derived EVs. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to highlight the therapeutic frontiers of NSC‐derived EVs in treating neurodegenerative diseases and advancing neural regeneration.\nIn recent years, several innovative biotherapeutic strategies have emerged to promote neural repair by either activating the brain's intrinsic regenerative capacity or introducing exogenous sources of support. Although significant progress has been made—using neurotrophic factors, neutralizing antibodies, gene therapy, biomaterials, and cell‐based therapies—major challenges remain that limit the clinical translation of these approaches.\nThis section explores both avenues: enhancing endogenous repair mechanisms and employing exogenous interventions to highlight current advances and future directions in CNS regeneration. Finally, the unique advantages of NSC‐derived EVs and their potential to overcome the limitations of existing regenerative strategies will be outlined.\nExperimental studies have identified key populations (Figure\nLimited endogenous repair potential and main strategies for neural regeneration. (a) Main stem cell‐like populations in the adult brain include neural stem cells (NSCs) or ependymal cells (ECs) located in neurogenic niches such as the subventricular zone (SVZ), subgranular zone (SGZ), amygdala, striatum, cortex, and hypothalamus. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are distributed throughout the brain and contribute to myelination and neural repair. Perivascular mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and pericytes reside in the vascular niche, while brain endothelial cells (BECs) within the blood–brain barrier (BBB) exhibit progenitor‐like properties. (b) Endogenous stem cells possess self‐renewal capacity and multipotency, enabling neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Their function is tightly regulated by the microenvironment, including soluble factors (cytokines, neurotrophins), extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying signaling molecules and mitochondria, and neuroimmune interactions. However, their repair capacity is inherently limited and declines with aging, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunctions. (c) Advanced therapeutic approaches aim to overcome the limitations of endogenous repair mechanisms. These include:\nAmong these, NSCs stand out as the most therapeutically versatile population due to several distinguishing features. They possess a tripotent differentiation capacity, allowing them to generate neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes—essential for comprehensive neural repair. NSCs are also highly responsive to environmental cues, enabling dynamic adaptation to injury or disease (Pourabdolhossein et al.\nThese features have positioned NSCs as a central focus in neuroregenerative strategies. However, endogenous NSCs in the adult human CNS are largely restricted to specific neurogenic niches and remain predominantly in a quiescent state under physiological conditions. Another major factor is the limited quantity of NSCs in endogenous pools, which may prove insufficient for addressing extensive damage, such as stroke (Bian et al.\nMetabolic imbalances can disrupt nutrient‐sensing pathways crucial for NSC fate and neurogenesis (Fidaleo et al.\nThese challenges underscore the need to develop strategies that can enhance the regenerative potential of endogenous NSCs (Figure\nSome advances in targeting endogenous pools include the use of neurotrophic factors, neutralizing antibodies targeting endogenous molecules within the microenvironment that inhibit CNS repair, gene therapy for cell‐target DNA repair, in situ‐directed reprogramming of CNS cells, and the development of biomaterials to modify the disrupted CNS extracellular matrix (Zamproni et al.\nMoreover, in vivo and in situ neuronal conversion of CNS cells—such as astrocytes (Barker et al.\nTo enhance the limited endogenous repair capacity, various cell types have been transplanted in different neurological conditions. These primarily include NSCs or glial‐restricted progenitors derived from ESCs or iPSCs, iNSCs, MSCs, and more recently, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR‐T cells) (Bonafede and Mariotti\nNSCs have garnered significant interest as potential biotherapeutics for neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases due to their expandability, ability to integrate into existing neuroglial elements, and capacity to promote functional repair (Mozafari et al.\nPreclinical studies on myelin diseases reveal that, when administered intraparenchymally, iPSC‐derived NSCs differentiate into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes and, to a lesser extent, into astrocytes or neurons in the adult CNS (Mozafari and Baron‐Van Evercooren\nAt the clinical level, several trials have explored the feasibility, safety, and early efficacy of NSC transplantation for various neurological conditions, with promising results (Table\nSummary of clinical trials using neural stem cell transplantation in neurological disorders.\nChronic Thoracic SCI\n(\nTraumatic Cervical SCI\n(KCT0000879)\nP‐MS\n(\nP‐MS\n(\nALS\n(\nI (1.5 years)\nI (2–2.5 years)\nALS\n(\n\nAbbreviations: ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALS‐FRS‐R, ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised; CNS10‐NPC‐GDNF, human neural progenitor cells genetically modified to express glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF); CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; hfNPCs, human fetal neural progenitor cells; hNSCs, human neural stem cells; hNSPCs, human neural stem/progenitor cells; ICV, intracerebroventricular; I/IIa, clinical trial phases I and IIa; intraspinal, direct injection into the spinal cord; intrathecal, delivery into the spinal canal; KCT, Korea Clinical Trial Registry; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; MS, multiple sclerosis;\nAlthough NSC transplantation has shown promise in preclinical and early clinical studies by promoting neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and structural repair, its broader clinical translation remains limited by challenges such as immunogenicity, tumorigenicity, invasive delivery routes, and poor graft survival or integration. To address these limitations, increasing attention has turned toward harnessing the regenerative and immunomodulatory functions of transplanted cells through their secretome—particularly EVs. NSC‐derived EVs offer a compelling cell‐free alternative that retains many of the therapeutic effects of NSCs—such as the delivery of neurotrophic factors, immunomodulators, and even functional mitochondria—while avoiding the risks associated with cell‐based therapies. The following section details the advantages of NSC‐EV‐based biotherapy, including low immunogenicity, BBB penetration, neurotropism, and safety, combined with the functional sophistication of their parental cells, positioning them as a next‐generation regenerative platform for CNS repair.\nEVs represent a potent mechanism of action in various cell transplantation studies. EVs derived from diverse cell sources have been explored for the treatment of various neurological disorders (Putthanbut et al.\nAmong the diverse EV sources explored, those derived from MSCs and NSCs—for some similar reasons that make these cell types attractive in transplantation—are particularly compelling for neurological therapies due to their greater accessibility and well‐established regenerative, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties, rendering them more clinically translatable than EVs from many other CNS‐resident cell types (Hermann et al.\nSummary of current cell‐free therapies based on EVs for neurological disorders.\n↑ cortical layer development; ↑ deep‐layer neurons;\n↑ resilience to cellular stress\n\nAbbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; ANT1/2, adenine nucleotide translocase 1 and 2; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; BAG3, Bcl‐2‐associated athanogene 3; BBB, blood–brain barrier; CNS, central nervous system; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (a mouse model of multiple sclerosis); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EVs, extracellular vesicles; HSPB8, heat shock protein beta‐8; HT22, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line; KO, knockout; LC3B‐II, microtubule‐associated protein 1A/1B‐light chain 3B‐II (autophagy marker); miR, microRNA; MS, multiple sclerosis; MSCs, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; PD, Parkinson's disease; PNI, peripheral nerve injury; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SIRT2, sirtuin 2 (a NAD‐dependent deacetylase); TBI, traumatic brain injury; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; VM, ventral midbrain.\nWhile MSC‐derived EVs offer broad immunomodulatory and regenerative benefits, NSC‐derived EVs stand out for their specialized roles in neurodevelopment and circuit repair, making them particularly promising for neurodegenerative diseases. These EVs possess intrinsic neurogenic potential, are enriched with neurotrophic factors, and have been shown to enhance synaptic plasticity and cognitive function (Volpe et al.\nNSC‐derived EVs offer different therapeutic benefits of NSCs without the complexities of cell transplantation, avoiding issues like cell survival, engraftment, and differentiation. EVs derived from NSCs do not carry the same risks of uncontrolled cell proliferation, tumor formation, or improper integration associated with live cell transplants (Li et al.\nNSC‐derived EVs can protect neurons through enhancing the expression of antioxidant enzymes and reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which rescue mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases (Li et al.\nCollectively, these properties highlight NSC‐derived EVs as a promising cell‐free therapeutic approach, offering neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and regeneration while also having the potential to be used as off‐the‐shelf products, thereby circumventing the challenges associated with direct NSC transplantation.\nAccumulating evidence from preclinical animal studies suggests that NSC‐derived EVs have significant and translatable therapeutic potential, which, with further mechanistic insights, could reshape the current treatment paradigm for neurological conditions, particularly age‐associated CNS disorders. These studies have demonstrated substantial global phenotypic improvement, including immunological, physiological, and behavioral outcomes, in the animal groups treated with NSC‐derived EVs.\nMoreover, preclinical findings suggest that NSC‐derived EVs mitigate key hallmarks of diseases, notably reducing neuroinflammation, lesion volume, neuronal loss, demyelination, and protein aggregation while enhancing neuroprotection, metabolic function, and synaptic activity (Madhu et al.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of action of NSC‐derived EVs can help identify specific molecular targets, enabling their engineering and further enhancing their therapeutic efficacy and potential as biotherapeutic agents. Mechanistic studies show that NSC‐derived EVs offer multiple therapeutic advantages, including modulating neuroinflammation, promoting neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, restoring cellular metabolism, and protecting against neurodegeneration.\nThe potential capacity of NSC‐derived EVs to promote neurogenesis and gliogenesis has fundamental roles for the replacement of cell loss associated with neurodegenerative diseases and also to switch aging‐associated quiescent NSCs to an active status and stimulate the formation of new neurons and glial cells (Ruetz et al.\nIn a study using EVs derived from NSCs, the authors have shown that EVs have the potential to buffer the effect induced by H\nNSC‐derived EVs can also regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation after spinal cord injury via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Upregulating acid‐sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1A) in NSCs raises the activity of prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which causes EVs with high PGE2 levels to be released. These EVs act in a paracrine way and inhibit NSC differentiation into oligodendrocytes. Blocking ASIC1A or PTGS2 reduces PGE2 in EVs, reversing this inhibition and promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation (Wu et al.\nMultimodal mechanisms of action of NSC‐EVs. (a) NSC‐EVs enhance neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation through miRNA‐mediated regulation, ERK signaling, and protection against oxidative stress. They also influence oligodendrocyte differentiation via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling. (b) NSC‐EVs regulate inflammatory responses via various molecular pathways. They transfer IFN‐γ to activate Stat1 signaling in target cells and suppress microglial activation through miRNA‐mediated mechanisms. NSC‐EVs also mitigate inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) via YBX1 and autophagy‐mediated pathways, reducing pro‐inflammatory cytokine expression. (c) NSC‐EVs protect against oxidative stress, preserve mitochondrial function by transferring intact mitochondria, regulate metabolic homeostasis, and counteract neurotoxic astrocyte activation. Additionally, NSC‐EVs suppress microglial reactivity, modulate inflammatory pathways, and mitigate aging‐associated neurodegenerative processes. Together, these multimodal actions highlight the therapeutic potential of NSC‐derived EVs in CNS repair and regeneration. Created by BioRender.\nCurrent studies have demonstrated that NSC‐derived EVs are an important modulator of neuroinflammation, acting through diverse mechanisms in target cells. For example, EVs from NSCs transfer IFN‐γ via Ifngr1 to activate Stat1 signaling and induce specific activation of pro‐inflammatory cytokine signaling in fibroblast cell lines (Cossetti et al.\nIn microglia, EVs from NSCs seemed to exert an anti‐inflammatory role via miRNAs. Accordingly, knockdown of NSC‐derived EV‐enriched miRNAs (including let‐7i, miR‐21a, and miR‐10b) significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of EVs on Aβ‐induced microglial activation in animal models of AD (Gao et al.\nEVs from NSCs can also promote anti‐inflammatory function, regulating the mechanisms of cellular death (Peng et al.\nMoreover, EV treatment increased the expression of the autophagy marker proteins LC3B and beclin‐1 and promoted autophagosome formation in spinal neurons after SCI. This comes together with upregulated expression of the anti‐apoptotic protein Bcl‐2 and reduced expression levels of the pro‐apoptotic protein Bax, the apoptosis effector cleaved caspase‐3 (Rong et al.\nAdditionally, Rong et al. reported that NSC‐derived EV pretreatment inhibits microglial activation (lower number of CD68+ microglia near the injury site) and reduces neuroinflammation, exhibiting lower RNA and protein expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IL‐6). In the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3‐Methyladenine (3MA), all these protective effects of EVs on spinal neurons and microglia were reversed (Rong et al.\nMoreover, hiPSC‐NSC‐EVs have shown promise in mitigating Aβ‐24o‐induced neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo in an AD mouse model by reducing neuroinflammation, amyloid plaques, and tau phosphorylation, leading to improved cognitive and mood functions (Rao et al.\nAll in all, NSC‐derived EVs can modulate neuroinflammation and promote neuronal survival by regulating miRNAs, cell death pathways (such as pyroptosis and apoptosis), and autophagy in models of neurodegenerative diseases and injury (Figure\nOne approach for ameliorating and delaying the progression of aging and the age‐associated neurodegenerative diseases is to promote neuroprotection, that is, an effect that may result in the salvage, recovery, or regeneration of the nervous system, its cells, structure, and function (Vajda\nMost preclinical studies highlight the neuroprotective role of NSC‐derived EVs, with mechanistic studies illustrating how these EVs can mitigate the effects of aging and the hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. As discussed in the previous section, research by Ma et al. and Ocana et al. has already shown the neuroprotective potential of iNSC‐ and NSC‐derived EVs, particularly in oxidative stress conditions that promote cell apoptosis (Ma, Li, et al.\nAnother key aspect of neuroprotection is the regulation of critical nutrient concentrations and the modification of the microenvironment's physiology, which helps support neuronal health and function (Iraci et al.\nFurther to improve microenvironment nutrients, cellular metabolism, and stress tolerance, EVs from NSCs could safeguard cells from neurotoxic substances, such as long‐chain saturated fatty acids secreted by reactive astrocytes (Li, Zhang, et al.\nAnother way NSC‐derived EVs promote neuroprotection is by mitigating hallmarks of the aging process, since many of these neurodegenerative conditions exhibit aging‐associated pathological pathways or are exacerbated by the aging process (Nicaise et al.\nIn an experimental model of brain insulin resistance (BIR)‐dependent cognitive impairment induced by insulin‐resistant NSCs, mice fed a high‐fat diet (HFD) showed reduced NSC proliferation and increased senescence of self‐renewing cells, as assessed by double‐labelling with BrdU and the immature neuron marker DCX (Natale et al.\nCollectively, these studies summarized in Table\nSummary of recent advances in NSC‐derived EV‐based therapies in neurological conditions.\n↑ Dopaminergic neuron survival,\n↓ ROS accumulation, apoptosis, and necrosis; catalase delivery confirmed\nNo significant effect under normal neurogenesis conditions.\nAfter Ara‐C–mediated NPC proliferation inhibition, NPC‐EVs improved neurological scores and reduced infarct volume\nIn vivo: Mouse model of status epilepticus\nIn vitro: macrophage inflammatory model\nIV and\nin vitro OGD/R\n↓ IFNβ, ↓ ELOVL1, ↓ saturated lipids; ↓ astrocyte neurotoxicity; ↓ neuronal apoptosis; motor recovery; ↓ lipid‐induced lipoapoptosis; BBB permeable.\nAlso compared NSC‐EVs with MSC‐EVs in vitro and in vivo; NSC‐EVs demonstrated superior anti‐neurotoxic astrocyte activity\n\nAbbreviations: 3MA, 3‐methyladenine; 5xFAD, transgenic mouse model carrying five familial Alzheimer's disease mutations; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ANT1/2, adenine nucleotide translocase 1 and 2; Ara‐C, cytosine arabinoside; ASIC1A, acid‐sensing ion channel subunit 1A; Aβ, amyloid‐beta peptide; BBB, blood–brain barrier; Beclin‐1, autophagy‐related protein; Catalase, antioxidant enzyme; CNS, central nervous system; COX‐2, cyclooxygenase‐2; E13, embryonic day 13; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ELOVL1, elongation of very long‐chain fatty acids protein 1; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase; EVs, extracellular vesicles; FGF2, fibroblast growth factor 2; FoxO, forkhead box O; GFs, growth factors; GPR30, G‐protein–coupled estrogen receptor 30; hfNSCs, human fetal neural stem cells; hiPSC‐NSCs, human‐induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neural stem cells; HT22, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line; I/R, ischemia–reperfusion; IC, intracerebral; ICV, intracerebroventricular; IFN‐1/IFNβ, interferon type I/beta; IGF2, insulin‐like growth factor 2; IL‐1β, interleukin‐1 beta; IN, intranasal; IRS‐1, insulin receptor substrate 1; KO, knockout; LC3B, microtubule‐associated protein 1A/1B‐light chain 3B (autophagy marker); LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MDA, malondialdehyde; mENPCs, mouse embryonic neural progenitor cells; miNSCs, induced neural stem cells; miR, microRNA; mNPCs, mouse neural progenitor cells; mNSCs, mouse neural stem cells; mSVZ, mouse subventricular zone; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; NLRP3, nucleotide‐binding oligomerization domain‐like receptor protein 3; NPCs, neural progenitor cells; NSPCs, neural stem/progenitor cells; OGD/R, oxygen–glucose deprivation/reperfusion; PD, Parkinson's disease; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; Prdx2, peroxiredoxin‐2; PTGS2, prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX‐2); rfNSCs, rat fetal neural stem cells; rNSCs, rat neural stem cells; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SCI, spinal cord injury; SH‐SY5Y, human neuroblastoma cell line; SPOP, speckle‐type POZ protein; SVZ, subventricular zone; Tau, microtubule‐associated protein tau; tMCAO, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; Txn, thioredoxin; WT, wild‐type; YBX1, Y‐box binding protein 1.\nEncouraged by robust preclinical results, the field is now progressing toward early‐phase clinical trials using NSC‐EVs. However, the transition from bench to bedside remains far from straightforward. Despite their therapeutic promise, NSC‐EVs face substantial technological and regulatory hurdles that limit their clinical translation from bench to market. A key challenge is the large‐scale, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)‐compliant production of NSC‐EVs, constrained by the limited availability of high‐quality NSC sources and the absence of standardized protocols for EV isolation, purification, and characterization. Common methods such as ultracentrifugation and tangential flow filtration often fail to ensure high yield and batch‐to‐batch consistency—both essential for clinical‐grade manufacturing (Sanz‐Ros et al.\nTo overcome these bottlenecks, advances in engineering and biomanufacturing are gaining traction. Techniques such as electroporation, transfection, and membrane fusion are being employed to enhance EV cargo loading, while surface modification with targeting peptides or antibodies improves delivery specificity. These engineering strategies, combined with scalable GMP‐compliant production systems, offer promising solutions to current limitations in yield and targeting (Ma et al.\nA search was performed on\nOngoing clinical trials of iNSC‐derived EVs in neurological disorders.\nThe Safety and Efficacy of NouvSoma001 in Ischemic Stroke\n(\nThe Safety and Efficacy of NouvSoma001 in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders\n(\n\nAbbreviations: EVs, extracellular vesicles; IV, intravenous; NCT, National Clinical Trial (identifier); NMOSD, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder; NouvSoma001, human‐induced NSC‐derived extracellular vesicles; NSC, neural stem cell; Phase I, first‐in‐human clinical trial phase focusing on safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy.\nThe translation of the NSC‐derived EV biotherapeutic approach into clinical practice remains constrained by a range of scientific, technical, and regulatory challenges. Among these are issues related to the standardization of EV production and characterization, heterogeneity, scalability for clinical‐grade manufacturing, delivery across the BBB, and long‐term safety. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of EVs is closely tied to the biological profile of their parental NSCs, making the choice of cell source a critical determinant of success.\nEV characteristics are largely determined by the properties of their parent cells. Selecting an appropriate NSC source requires careful evaluation of several factors, including donor compatibility (autologous vs. allogeneic), tumorigenic factors, population purity and homogeneity, and the specific disease context (focal vs. multifocal or widespread). NSCs can be derived from various regions of the brain or spinal cord, from fetal or adult tissues, or through direct reprogramming of ES or iPS cells—each yielding EVs with distinct molecular signatures and functional capacities. Therefore, NSC source selection must be tailored to the specific neurological condition being targeted.\nHistorically, human NSCs isolated from fetal tissues have been a common source of EVs due to their ability to differentiate into a range of neural lineages and their therapeutic potential (Willis, Nicaise, Peruzzotti‐Jametti, and Pluchino\nFurthermore, EVs derived from NSCs of different brain regions may also vary in their therapeutic effects. For instance, EVs from a human fetal NSC line displayed neuroprotective properties against oxidative stress in vitro, while hypothalamic NSC‐derived EVs demonstrated endocrine‐like effects, influencing neurogenesis and systemic aging in mice (Bonetto and Grilli\nNSC‐derived EVs, even when produced from a similar cell source, represent a highly heterogeneous population with diverse molecular cargo, physical properties, and biological functions—posing significant challenges for their clinical standardization (Peruzzotti‐Jametti et al.\nTo address these limitations, several promising approaches have emerged. First, subpopulation isolation techniques such as microfluidics, size‐exclusion chromatography, and immunoaffinity capture using markers like CD63 or NCAM can help obtain functionally uniform EV subsets for therapeutic use (Zhang, Huang, et al.\nCollectively, these strategies provide a rational roadmap to overcome NSC‐EV heterogeneity and facilitate their safe, consistent, and effective application in CNS therapeutics.\nBeyond the need for production and characterization standardization, optimization of storage and downstream handling is also critical for the clinical translation of NSC‐derived EVs. In relation to optimization of storage conditions, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) recommends that EVs be conserved in isotonic buffers to prevent pH shifts during storage as well as during freezing and thawing procedures and stored at −80°C (Welsh et al.\nTreating CNS diseases with EVs is particularly challenging due to the presence of the BBB; therefore, various delivery methods are currently under investigation. The most effective approach for delivering NSC‐derived EVs across different neurological conditions needs to be optimized in a disease‐specific manner. Common delivery strategies include (a) intranasal administration, which allows rapid CNS absorption; (b) intravascular microbubbles combined with focused ultrasound to transiently open the BBB; (c) oral delivery of plant‐, milk‐, or bacteria‐derived EVs, which have been shown to reach the brain in some studies; (d) intravenous injection, though limited by short circulation time and rapid clearance; (e) intraperitoneal injection, which allows for high local uptake; and (f) subcutaneous injection, which shows minimal brain delivery. More invasive approaches include (g–h) intrathecal or intraventricular injection into the CSF, and (i) direct injection into specific brain regions or tumors (Nieland et al.\nWith advancements in EV isolation and enhanced cell specificity, EVs hold great promise for tissue‐specific applications by enabling targeted therapy delivery, improving treatment efficacy, and minimizing side effects (Zhang, Wu, et al.\nNevertheless, ethical and regulatory challenges remain significant considerations in the development of EV‐based therapies. The ISEV emphasizes that EV therapies are subject to regulations governing “tissues and cells” and “advanced therapy medicinal products” (ATMPs) (Lener et al.\nAltogether, despite the significant promise of NSC‐derived EVs for neurological therapy, several challenges must be addressed before their widespread clinical application. Key challenges include optimizing NSC sources, standardizing EV isolation and characterization, scaling up production while ensuring quality, and evaluating long‐term safety. Refining delivery strategies and advancing EV bioengineering, storage, and regulatory frameworks are essential for translating NSC‐EVs into clinically viable off‐the‐shelf therapies.\nThe CNS has limited regenerative capacity, with NSCs residing in neurogenic zones playing a role in self‐repair. While they hold promise for treating neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, their endogenous repair capacity is often insufficient, particularly with aging, which compromises neurogenesis and contributes to disease progression. Dysfunction within the NSC niche, influenced by inflammation and environmental factors, further limits their regenerative potential. Approaches such as neurotrophic factors, gene therapy, and in vivo glial reprogramming show promise but face clinical challenges.\nNSCs can be sourced from embryonic, fetal, or adult tissues, or reprogrammed from somatic cells. Despite promising preclinical and early clinical data in MS, ALS, and PD, challenges such as ethical concerns, tumorigenicity, and donor compatibility remain. NSC‐derived EVs, serving as a potent mechanism of action in NSC therapy, represent a promising cell‐free biotherapeutic approach due to their intrinsic neurogenic potential, offering advantages over cell therapy such as reduced immunogenicity and enhanced targeting capabilities. They provide neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and metabolic support, promoting neural regeneration in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases.\nPreclinical studies show that NSC‐EVs can mitigate neurodegeneration, reduce oxidative stress, and support mitochondrial function—modulating multiple pathways critical to CNS repair. Ongoing clinical trials underscore their potential as scalable, off‐the‐shelf therapeutics for stroke and neuroimmune disorders. However, translating NSC‐EVs into clinical therapies will require significant progress in optimizing delivery strategies, refining bioengineering approaches, and establishing comprehensive safety profiles. Key challenges include minimizing EV heterogeneity and off‐target effects, ensuring the long‐term safety of repeated administration, and eliminating unintended cargo such as oncogenic miRNAs or pro‐inflammatory cytokines. Clinical success will depend on a coordinated, multidisciplinary effort—integrating advanced bioengineering, standardized analytical methods, rigorous safety testing, and harmonized global regulatory frameworks. Central to this progress will be the development of GMP‐compliant manufacturing processes, validated potency assays, and clear regulatory pathways tailored to the unique complexity of NSC‐EV‐based therapeutics. Ultimately, bridging the fields of neural stem cell biology, nanotechnology, and clinical neuroscience will be crucial to unlock the full therapeutic potential of NSC‐EVs and bring transformative treatments to patients with currently untreatable neurological diseases.\n\nDuring the preparation of this work the authors used ChatGPT to check the grammar.

Growing evidence shows that endogenous NSCs in mammals and humans can shift between quiescence and active proliferation, supporting neurogenesis and gliogenesis during inflammatory CNS disorders (Martino and Pluchino\nRecent studies on inflammatory CNS disorders suggest that dysfunction within the microenvironmental niches where NSCs reside may be responsible for their inability to achieve full restoration (Pluchino et al.\nVarious regenerative approaches have been explored to prevent disease progression and enhance repair mechanisms by targeting the CNS microenvironment. Therapies that can directly or indirectly target the niche microenvironment to restore NSC behavior and promote neuronal regeneration could have a significant impact on the treatment of inflammatory CNS disorders (Martino and Pluchino\nNSCs exert many of their biological effects through their secretome, notably via EVs—nano‐ to micro‐sized, lipid bilayer‐enclosed particles that are secreted by cells and lack replication capacity (Welsh et al.\nEVs are broadly classified based on size, biogenesis, and composition into three main subtypes: exosomes (30–150 nm), which are formed within the endosomal pathway and released through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane; microvesicles (100–1000 nm), also known as ectosomes, which originate by direct outward budding of the plasma membrane; and apoptotic bodies (50–4000 nm), which are shed from cells undergoing programmed cell death and contain nuclear fragments and organelles (Welsh et al.\nBeyond the canonical subtypes, additional vesicular and non‐vesicular extracellular particles have been described, reflecting the expanding complexity of intercellular communication. These include ARMMS (arrestin domain‐containing protein 1‐mediated microvesicles) involved in Notch signaling; migrasomes, which bud from retraction fibers of migrating cells and mediate tissue remodeling; and exophers, which expel damaged cellular components under stress (Wang et al.\nConsistent with the minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles (MISEV) 2023 guidelines, we avoid using terms such as “\nThe unique and multifunctional ability of EVs to influence multiple biological pathways makes them particularly attractive candidates for addressing the complex pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. By modulating the microenvironment of the CNS, NSC‐derived EVs have emerged as a promising cell‐free biotherapeutic strategy, capable of replicating many of the beneficial effects of NSC transplantation while circumventing challenges related to cell survival, immune rejection, and tumorigenic risk. Particularly compelling is their ability to mediate neuroimmune interactions, promote neural repair, and modulate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. These vesicles have been shown to influence key pathophysiological processes in both neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions, including neuroprotection, immune regulation, synaptic plasticity, and tissue regeneration.\nHere we will explore recent advances in biotherapeutic approaches for treating neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on NSC‐derived EVs. It will delve into their mechanisms of action, particularly their role in modulating inflammatory pathways, neuroprotection, and neurometabolic support, while also discussing recent progress in preclinical and clinical applications. Furthermore, we will critically examine the challenges associated with the clinical translation of NSC‐derived EVs. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to highlight the therapeutic frontiers of NSC‐derived EVs in treating neurodegenerative diseases and advancing neural regeneration.\nIn recent years, several innovative biotherapeutic strategies have emerged to promote neural repair by either activating the brain's intrinsic regenerative capacity or introducing exogenous sources of support. Although significant progress has been made—using neurotrophic factors, neutralizing antibodies, gene therapy, biomaterials, and cell‐based therapies—major challenges remain that limit the clinical translation of these approaches.\nThis section explores both avenues: enhancing endogenous repair mechanisms and employing exogenous interventions to highlight current advances and future directions in CNS regeneration. Finally, the unique advantages of NSC‐derived EVs and their potential to overcome the limitations of existing regenerative strategies will be outlined.\nExperimental studies have identified key populations (Figure\nLimited endogenous repair potential and main strategies for neural regeneration. (a) Main stem cell‐like populations in the adult brain include neural stem cells (NSCs) or ependymal cells (ECs) located in neurogenic niches such as the subventricular zone (SVZ), subgranular zone (SGZ), amygdala, striatum, cortex, and hypothalamus. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are distributed throughout the brain and contribute to myelination and neural repair. Perivascular mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and pericytes reside in the vascular niche, while brain endothelial cells (BECs) within the blood–brain barrier (BBB) exhibit progenitor‐like properties. (b) Endogenous stem cells possess self‐renewal capacity and multipotency, enabling neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Their function is tightly regulated by the microenvironment, including soluble factors (cytokines, neurotrophins), extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying signaling molecules and mitochondria, and neuroimmune interactions. However, their repair capacity is inherently limited and declines with aging, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunctions. (c) Advanced therapeutic approaches aim to overcome the limitations of endogenous repair mechanisms. These include:\nAmong these, NSCs stand out as the most therapeutically versatile population due to several distinguishing features. They possess a tripotent differentiation capacity, allowing them to generate neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes—essential for comprehensive neural repair. NSCs are also highly responsive to environmental cues, enabling dynamic adaptation to injury or disease (Pourabdolhossein et al.\nThese features have positioned NSCs as a central focus in neuroregenerative strategies. However, endogenous NSCs in the adult human CNS are largely restricted to specific neurogenic niches and remain predominantly in a quiescent state under physiological conditions. Another major factor is the limited quantity of NSCs in endogenous pools, which may prove insufficient for addressing extensive damage, such as stroke (Bian et al.\nMetabolic imbalances can disrupt nutrient‐sensing pathways crucial for NSC fate and neurogenesis (Fidaleo et al.\nThese challenges underscore the need to develop strategies that can enhance the regenerative potential of endogenous NSCs (Figure\nSome advances in targeting endogenous pools include the use of neurotrophic factors, neutralizing antibodies targeting endogenous molecules within the microenvironment that inhibit CNS repair, gene therapy for cell‐target DNA repair, in situ‐directed reprogramming of CNS cells, and the development of biomaterials to modify the disrupted CNS extracellular matrix (Zamproni et al.\nMoreover, in vivo and in situ neuronal conversion of CNS cells—such as astrocytes (Barker et al.\nTo enhance the limited endogenous repair capacity, various cell types have been transplanted in different neurological conditions. These primarily include NSCs or glial‐restricted progenitors derived from ESCs or iPSCs, iNSCs, MSCs, and more recently, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR‐T cells) (Bonafede and Mariotti\nNSCs have garnered significant interest as potential biotherapeutics for neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases due to their expandability, ability to integrate into existing neuroglial elements, and capacity to promote functional repair (Mozafari et al.\nPreclinical studies on myelin diseases reveal that, when administered intraparenchymally, iPSC‐derived NSCs differentiate into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes and, to a lesser extent, into astrocytes or neurons in the adult CNS (Mozafari and Baron‐Van Evercooren\nAt the clinical level, several trials have explored the feasibility, safety, and early efficacy of NSC transplantation for various neurological conditions, with promising results (Table\nSummary of clinical trials using neural stem cell transplantation in neurological disorders.\nChronic Thoracic SCI\n(\nTraumatic Cervical SCI\n(KCT0000879)\nP‐MS\n(\nP‐MS\n(\nALS\n(\nI (1.5 years)\nI (2–2.5 years)\nALS\n(\n\nAbbreviations: ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALS‐FRS‐R, ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised; CNS10‐NPC‐GDNF, human neural progenitor cells genetically modified to express glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF); CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; hfNPCs, human fetal neural progenitor cells; hNSCs, human neural stem cells; hNSPCs, human neural stem/progenitor cells; ICV, intracerebroventricular; I/IIa, clinical trial phases I and IIa; intraspinal, direct injection into the spinal cord; intrathecal, delivery into the spinal canal; KCT, Korea Clinical Trial Registry; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; MS, multiple sclerosis;\nAlthough NSC transplantation has shown promise in preclinical and early clinical studies by promoting neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and structural repair, its broader clinical translation remains limited by challenges such as immunogenicity, tumorigenicity, invasive delivery routes, and poor graft survival or integration. To address these limitations, increasing attention has turned toward harnessing the regenerative and immunomodulatory functions of transplanted cells through their secretome—particularly EVs. NSC‐derived EVs offer a compelling cell‐free alternative that retains many of the therapeutic effects of NSCs—such as the delivery of neurotrophic factors, immunomodulators, and even functional mitochondria—while avoiding the risks associated with cell‐based therapies. The following section details the advantages of NSC‐EV‐based biotherapy, including low immunogenicity, BBB penetration, neurotropism, and safety, combined with the functional sophistication of their parental cells, positioning them as a next‐generation regenerative platform for CNS repair.\nEVs represent a potent mechanism of action in various cell transplantation studies. EVs derived from diverse cell sources have been explored for the treatment of various neurological disorders (Putthanbut et al.\nAmong the diverse EV sources explored, those derived from MSCs and NSCs—for some similar reasons that make these cell types attractive in transplantation—are particularly compelling for neurological therapies due to their greater accessibility and well‐established regenerative, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties, rendering them more clinically translatable than EVs from many other CNS‐resident cell types (Hermann et al.\nSummary of current cell‐free therapies based on EVs for neurological disorders.\n↑ cortical layer development; ↑ deep‐layer neurons;\n↑ resilience to cellular stress\n\nAbbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; ANT1/2, adenine nucleotide translocase 1 and 2; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; BAG3, Bcl‐2‐associated athanogene 3; BBB, blood–brain barrier; CNS, central nervous system; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (a mouse model of multiple sclerosis); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EVs, extracellular vesicles; HSPB8, heat shock protein beta‐8; HT22, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line; KO, knockout; LC3B‐II, microtubule‐associated protein 1A/1B‐light chain 3B‐II (autophagy marker); miR, microRNA; MS, multiple sclerosis; MSCs, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; PD, Parkinson's disease; PNI, peripheral nerve injury; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SIRT2, sirtuin 2 (a NAD‐dependent deacetylase); TBI, traumatic brain injury; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; VM, ventral midbrain.\nWhile MSC‐derived EVs offer broad immunomodulatory and regenerative benefits, NSC‐derived EVs stand out for their specialized roles in neurodevelopment and circuit repair, making them particularly promising for neurodegenerative diseases. These EVs possess intrinsic neurogenic potential, are enriched with neurotrophic factors, and have been shown to enhance synaptic plasticity and cognitive function (Volpe et al.\nNSC‐derived EVs offer different therapeutic benefits of NSCs without the complexities of cell transplantation, avoiding issues like cell survival, engraftment, and differentiation. EVs derived from NSCs do not carry the same risks of uncontrolled cell proliferation, tumor formation, or improper integration associated with live cell transplants (Li et al.\nNSC‐derived EVs can protect neurons through enhancing the expression of antioxidant enzymes and reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which rescue mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases (Li et al.\nCollectively, these properties highlight NSC‐derived EVs as a promising cell‐free therapeutic approach, offering neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and regeneration while also having the potential to be used as off‐the‐shelf products, thereby circumventing the challenges associated with direct NSC transplantation.\nAccumulating evidence from preclinical animal studies suggests that NSC‐derived EVs have significant and translatable therapeutic potential, which, with further mechanistic insights, could reshape the current treatment paradigm for neurological conditions, particularly age‐associated CNS disorders. These studies have demonstrated substantial global phenotypic improvement, including immunological, physiological, and behavioral outcomes, in the animal groups treated with NSC‐derived EVs.\nMoreover, preclinical findings suggest that NSC‐derived EVs mitigate key hallmarks of diseases, notably reducing neuroinflammation, lesion volume, neuronal loss, demyelination, and protein aggregation while enhancing neuroprotection, metabolic function, and synaptic activity (Madhu et al.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of action of NSC‐derived EVs can help identify specific molecular targets, enabling their engineering and further enhancing their therapeutic efficacy and potential as biotherapeutic agents. Mechanistic studies show that NSC‐derived EVs offer multiple therapeutic advantages, including modulating neuroinflammation, promoting neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, restoring cellular metabolism, and protecting against neurodegeneration.\nThe potential capacity of NSC‐derived EVs to promote neurogenesis and gliogenesis has fundamental roles for the replacement of cell loss associated with neurodegenerative diseases and also to switch aging‐associated quiescent NSCs to an active status and stimulate the formation of new neurons and glial cells (Ruetz et al.\nIn a study using EVs derived from NSCs, the authors have shown that EVs have the potential to buffer the effect induced by H\nNSC‐derived EVs can also regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation after spinal cord injury via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Upregulating acid‐sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1A) in NSCs raises the activity of prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which causes EVs with high PGE2 levels to be released. These EVs act in a paracrine way and inhibit NSC differentiation into oligodendrocytes. Blocking ASIC1A or PTGS2 reduces PGE2 in EVs, reversing this inhibition and promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation (Wu et al.\nMultimodal mechanisms of action of NSC‐EVs. (a) NSC‐EVs enhance neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation through miRNA‐mediated regulation, ERK signaling, and protection against oxidative stress. They also influence oligodendrocyte differentiation via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling. (b) NSC‐EVs regulate inflammatory responses via various molecular pathways. They transfer IFN‐γ to activate Stat1 signaling in target cells and suppress microglial activation through miRNA‐mediated mechanisms. NSC‐EVs also mitigate inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) via YBX1 and autophagy‐mediated pathways, reducing pro‐inflammatory cytokine expression. (c) NSC‐EVs protect against oxidative stress, preserve mitochondrial function by transferring intact mitochondria, regulate metabolic homeostasis, and counteract neurotoxic astrocyte activation. Additionally, NSC‐EVs suppress microglial reactivity, modulate inflammatory pathways, and mitigate aging‐associated neurodegenerative processes. Together, these multimodal actions highlight the therapeutic potential of NSC‐derived EVs in CNS repair and regeneration. Created by BioRender.\nCurrent studies have demonstrated that NSC‐derived EVs are an important modulator of neuroinflammation, acting through diverse mechanisms in target cells. For example, EVs from NSCs transfer IFN‐γ via Ifngr1 to activate Stat1 signaling and induce specific activation of pro‐inflammatory cytokine signaling in fibroblast cell lines (Cossetti et al.\nIn microglia, EVs from NSCs seemed to exert an anti‐inflammatory role via miRNAs. Accordingly, knockdown of NSC‐derived EV‐enriched miRNAs (including let‐7i, miR‐21a, and miR‐10b) significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of EVs on Aβ‐induced microglial activation in animal models of AD (Gao et al.\nEVs from NSCs can also promote anti‐inflammatory function, regulating the mechanisms of cellular death (Peng et al.\nMoreover, EV treatment increased the expression of the autophagy marker proteins LC3B and beclin‐1 and promoted autophagosome formation in spinal neurons after SCI. This comes together with upregulated expression of the anti‐apoptotic protein Bcl‐2 and reduced expression levels of the pro‐apoptotic protein Bax, the apoptosis effector cleaved caspase‐3 (Rong et al.\nAdditionally, Rong et al. reported that NSC‐derived EV pretreatment inhibits microglial activation (lower number of CD68+ microglia near the injury site) and reduces neuroinflammation, exhibiting lower RNA and protein expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IL‐6). In the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3‐Methyladenine (3MA), all these protective effects of EVs on spinal neurons and microglia were reversed (Rong et al.\nMoreover, hiPSC‐NSC‐EVs have shown promise in mitigating Aβ‐24o‐induced neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo in an AD mouse model by reducing neuroinflammation, amyloid plaques, and tau phosphorylation, leading to improved cognitive and mood functions (Rao et al.\nAll in all, NSC‐derived EVs can modulate neuroinflammation and promote neuronal survival by regulating miRNAs, cell death pathways (such as pyroptosis and apoptosis), and autophagy in models of neurodegenerative diseases and injury (Figure\nOne approach for ameliorating and delaying the progression of aging and the age‐associated neurodegenerative diseases is to promote neuroprotection, that is, an effect that may result in the salvage, recovery, or regeneration of the nervous system, its cells, structure, and function (Vajda\nMost preclinical studies highlight the neuroprotective role of NSC‐derived EVs, with mechanistic studies illustrating how these EVs can mitigate the effects of aging and the hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. As discussed in the previous section, research by Ma et al. and Ocana et al. has already shown the neuroprotective potential of iNSC‐ and NSC‐derived EVs, particularly in oxidative stress conditions that promote cell apoptosis (Ma, Li, et al.\nAnother key aspect of neuroprotection is the regulation of critical nutrient concentrations and the modification of the microenvironment's physiology, which helps support neuronal health and function (Iraci et al.\nFurther to improve microenvironment nutrients, cellular metabolism, and stress tolerance, EVs from NSCs could safeguard cells from neurotoxic substances, such as long‐chain saturated fatty acids secreted by reactive astrocytes (Li, Zhang, et al.\nAnother way NSC‐derived EVs promote neuroprotection is by mitigating hallmarks of the aging process, since many of these neurodegenerative conditions exhibit aging‐associated pathological pathways or are exacerbated by the aging process (Nicaise et al.\nIn an experimental model of brain insulin resistance (BIR)‐dependent cognitive impairment induced by insulin‐resistant NSCs, mice fed a high‐fat diet (HFD) showed reduced NSC proliferation and increased senescence of self‐renewing cells, as assessed by double‐labelling with BrdU and the immature neuron marker DCX (Natale et al.\nCollectively, these studies summarized in Table\nSummary of recent advances in NSC‐derived EV‐based therapies in neurological conditions.\n↑ Dopaminergic neuron survival,\n↓ ROS accumulation, apoptosis, and necrosis; catalase delivery confirmed\nNo significant effect under normal neurogenesis conditions.\nAfter Ara‐C–mediated NPC proliferation inhibition, NPC‐EVs improved neurological scores and reduced infarct volume\nIn vivo: Mouse model of status epilepticus\nIn vitro: macrophage inflammatory model\nIV and\nin vitro OGD/R\n↓ IFNβ, ↓ ELOVL1, ↓ saturated lipids; ↓ astrocyte neurotoxicity; ↓ neuronal apoptosis; motor recovery; ↓ lipid‐induced lipoapoptosis; BBB permeable.\nAlso compared NSC‐EVs with MSC‐EVs in vitro and in vivo; NSC‐EVs demonstrated superior anti‐neurotoxic astrocyte activity\n\nAbbreviations: 3MA, 3‐methyladenine; 5xFAD, transgenic mouse model carrying five familial Alzheimer's disease mutations; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ANT1/2, adenine nucleotide translocase 1 and 2; Ara‐C, cytosine arabinoside; ASIC1A, acid‐sensing ion channel subunit 1A; Aβ, amyloid‐beta peptide; BBB, blood–brain barrier; Beclin‐1, autophagy‐related protein; Catalase, antioxidant enzyme; CNS, central nervous system; COX‐2, cyclooxygenase‐2; E13, embryonic day 13; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ELOVL1, elongation of very long‐chain fatty acids protein 1; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase; EVs, extracellular vesicles; FGF2, fibroblast growth factor 2; FoxO, forkhead box O; GFs, growth factors; GPR30, G‐protein–coupled estrogen receptor 30; hfNSCs, human fetal neural stem cells; hiPSC‐NSCs, human‐induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neural stem cells; HT22, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line; I/R, ischemia–reperfusion; IC, intracerebral; ICV, intracerebroventricular; IFN‐1/IFNβ, interferon type I/beta; IGF2, insulin‐like growth factor 2; IL‐1β, interleukin‐1 beta; IN, intranasal; IRS‐1, insulin receptor substrate 1; KO, knockout; LC3B, microtubule‐associated protein 1A/1B‐light chain 3B (autophagy marker); LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MDA, malondialdehyde; mENPCs, mouse embryonic neural progenitor cells; miNSCs, induced neural stem cells; miR, microRNA; mNPCs, mouse neural progenitor cells; mNSCs, mouse neural stem cells; mSVZ, mouse subventricular zone; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; NLRP3, nucleotide‐binding oligomerization domain‐like receptor protein 3; NPCs, neural progenitor cells; NSPCs, neural stem/progenitor cells; OGD/R, oxygen–glucose deprivation/reperfusion; PD, Parkinson's disease; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; Prdx2, peroxiredoxin‐2; PTGS2, prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX‐2); rfNSCs, rat fetal neural stem cells; rNSCs, rat neural stem cells; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SCI, spinal cord injury; SH‐SY5Y, human neuroblastoma cell line; SPOP, speckle‐type POZ protein; SVZ, subventricular zone; Tau, microtubule‐associated protein tau; tMCAO, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; Txn, thioredoxin; WT, wild‐type; YBX1, Y‐box binding protein 1.\nEncouraged by robust preclinical results, the field is now progressing toward early‐phase clinical trials using NSC‐EVs. However, the transition from bench to bedside remains far from straightforward. Despite their therapeutic promise, NSC‐EVs face substantial technological and regulatory hurdles that limit their clinical translation from bench to market. A key challenge is the large‐scale, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)‐compliant production of NSC‐EVs, constrained by the limited availability of high‐quality NSC sources and the absence of standardized protocols for EV isolation, purification, and characterization. Common methods such as ultracentrifugation and tangential flow filtration often fail to ensure high yield and batch‐to‐batch consistency—both essential for clinical‐grade manufacturing (Sanz‐Ros et al.\nTo overcome these bottlenecks, advances in engineering and biomanufacturing are gaining traction. Techniques such as electroporation, transfection, and membrane fusion are being employed to enhance EV cargo loading, while surface modification with targeting peptides or antibodies improves delivery specificity. These engineering strategies, combined with scalable GMP‐compliant production systems, offer promising solutions to current limitations in yield and targeting (Ma et al.\nA search was performed on\nOngoing clinical trials of iNSC‐derived EVs in neurological disorders.\nThe Safety and Efficacy of NouvSoma001 in Ischemic Stroke\n(\nThe Safety and Efficacy of NouvSoma001 in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders\n(\n\nAbbreviations: EVs, extracellular vesicles; IV, intravenous; NCT, National Clinical Trial (identifier); NMOSD, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder; NouvSoma001, human‐induced NSC‐derived extracellular vesicles; NSC, neural stem cell; Phase I, first‐in‐human clinical trial phase focusing on safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy.\nThe translation of the NSC‐derived EV biotherapeutic approach into clinical practice remains constrained by a range of scientific, technical, and regulatory challenges. Among these are issues related to the standardization of EV production and characterization, heterogeneity, scalability for clinical‐grade manufacturing, delivery across the BBB, and long‐term safety. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of EVs is closely tied to the biological profile of their parental NSCs, making the choice of cell source a critical determinant of success.\nEV characteristics are largely determined by the properties of their parent cells. Selecting an appropriate NSC source requires careful evaluation of several factors, including donor compatibility (autologous vs. allogeneic), tumorigenic factors, population purity and homogeneity, and the specific disease context (focal vs. multifocal or widespread). NSCs can be derived from various regions of the brain or spinal cord, from fetal or adult tissues, or through direct reprogramming of ES or iPS cells—each yielding EVs with distinct molecular signatures and functional capacities. Therefore, NSC source selection must be tailored to the specific neurological condition being targeted.\nHistorically, human NSCs isolated from fetal tissues have been a common source of EVs due to their ability to differentiate into a range of neural lineages and their therapeutic potential (Willis, Nicaise, Peruzzotti‐Jametti, and Pluchino\nFurthermore, EVs derived from NSCs of different brain regions may also vary in their therapeutic effects. For instance, EVs from a human fetal NSC line displayed neuroprotective properties against oxidative stress in vitro, while hypothalamic NSC‐derived EVs demonstrated endocrine‐like effects, influencing neurogenesis and systemic aging in mice (Bonetto and Grilli\nNSC‐derived EVs, even when produced from a similar cell source, represent a highly heterogeneous population with diverse molecular cargo, physical properties, and biological functions—posing significant challenges for their clinical standardization (Peruzzotti‐Jametti et al.\nTo address these limitations, several promising approaches have emerged. First, subpopulation isolation techniques such as microfluidics, size‐exclusion chromatography, and immunoaffinity capture using markers like CD63 or NCAM can help obtain functionally uniform EV subsets for therapeutic use (Zhang, Huang, et al.\nCollectively, these strategies provide a rational roadmap to overcome NSC‐EV heterogeneity and facilitate their safe, consistent, and effective application in CNS therapeutics.\nBeyond the need for production and characterization standardization, optimization of storage and downstream handling is also critical for the clinical translation of NSC‐derived EVs. In relation to optimization of storage conditions, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) recommends that EVs be conserved in isotonic buffers to prevent pH shifts during storage as well as during freezing and thawing procedures and stored at −80°C (Welsh et al.\nTreating CNS diseases with EVs is particularly challenging due to the presence of the BBB; therefore, various delivery methods are currently under investigation. The most effective approach for delivering NSC‐derived EVs across different neurological conditions needs to be optimized in a disease‐specific manner. Common delivery strategies include (a) intranasal administration, which allows rapid CNS absorption; (b) intravascular microbubbles combined with focused ultrasound to transiently open the BBB; (c) oral delivery of plant‐, milk‐, or bacteria‐derived EVs, which have been shown to reach the brain in some studies; (d) intravenous injection, though limited by short circulation time and rapid clearance; (e) intraperitoneal injection, which allows for high local uptake; and (f) subcutaneous injection, which shows minimal brain delivery. More invasive approaches include (g–h) intrathecal or intraventricular injection into the CSF, and (i) direct injection into specific brain regions or tumors (Nieland et al.\nWith advancements in EV isolation and enhanced cell specificity, EVs hold great promise for tissue‐specific applications by enabling targeted therapy delivery, improving treatment efficacy, and minimizing side effects (Zhang, Wu, et al.\nNevertheless, ethical and regulatory challenges remain significant considerations in the development of EV‐based therapies. The ISEV emphasizes that EV therapies are subject to regulations governing “tissues and cells” and “advanced therapy medicinal products” (ATMPs) (Lener et al.\nAltogether, despite the significant promise of NSC‐derived EVs for neurological therapy, several challenges must be addressed before their widespread clinical application. Key challenges include optimizing NSC sources, standardizing EV isolation and characterization, scaling up production while ensuring quality, and evaluating long‐term safety. Refining delivery strategies and advancing EV bioengineering, storage, and regulatory frameworks are essential for translating NSC‐EVs into clinically viable off‐the‐shelf therapies.\nThe CNS has limited regenerative capacity, with NSCs residing in neurogenic zones playing a role in self‐repair. While they hold promise for treating neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, their endogenous repair capacity is often insufficient, particularly with aging, which compromises neurogenesis and contributes to disease progression. Dysfunction within the NSC niche, influenced by inflammation and environmental factors, further limits their regenerative potential. Approaches such as neurotrophic factors, gene therapy, and in vivo glial reprogramming show promise but face clinical challenges.\nNSCs can be sourced from embryonic, fetal, or adult tissues, or reprogrammed from somatic cells. Despite promising preclinical and early clinical data in MS, ALS, and PD, challenges such as ethical concerns, tumorigenicity, and donor compatibility remain. NSC‐derived EVs, serving as a potent mechanism of action in NSC therapy, represent a promising cell‐free biotherapeutic approach due to their intrinsic neurogenic potential, offering advantages over cell therapy such as reduced immunogenicity and enhanced targeting capabilities. They provide neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and metabolic support, promoting neural regeneration in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases.\nPreclinical studies show that NSC‐EVs can mitigate neurodegeneration, reduce oxidative stress, and support mitochondrial function—modulating multiple pathways critical to CNS repair. Ongoing clinical trials underscore their potential as scalable, off‐the‐shelf therapeutics for stroke and neuroimmune disorders. However, translating NSC‐EVs into clinical therapies will require significant progress in optimizing delivery strategies, refining bioengineering approaches, and establishing comprehensive safety profiles. Key challenges include minimizing EV heterogeneity and off‐target effects, ensuring the long‐term safety of repeated administration, and eliminating unintended cargo such as oncogenic miRNAs or pro‐inflammatory cytokines. Clinical success will depend on a coordinated, multidisciplinary effort—integrating advanced bioengineering, standardized analytical methods, rigorous safety testing, and harmonized global regulatory frameworks. Central to this progress will be the development of GMP‐compliant manufacturing processes, validated potency assays, and clear regulatory pathways tailored to the unique complexity of NSC‐EV‐based therapeutics. Ultimately, bridging the fields of neural stem cell biology, nanotechnology, and clinical neuroscience will be crucial to unlock the full therapeutic potential of NSC‐EVs and bring transformative treatments to patients with currently untreatable neurological diseases.\n\nDuring the preparation of this work the authors used ChatGPT to check the grammar.

Historically considered distinct, these conditions are increasingly linked by trigeminal nerve-driven neurogenic inflammation. Activation of trigeminovascular afferents provokes antidromic release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP); beyond mediating migraine pain, these peptides remodel vasculature, immune infiltrates, and extracellular matrix to facilitate GBM invasion. Pre-clinical studies show CGRP and SP up-regulate matrix-metalloproteinases and integrins, while PACAP modulates cAMP–MAPK signalling, collectively promoting perivascular migration and temozolomide resistance. Epidemiological analyses report higher migraine antecedents in patients later diagnosed with brain tumours, and high-resolution MRI frequently localises GBM spread along trigeminal pathways, underscoring anatomical plausibility. Emerging therapeutics mirror these insights: aprepitant (an NK1-receptor antagonist) triggers GBM apoptosis, gepant-class CGRP blockers curb invasive phenotypes, and radiolabelled SP analogues deliver focal alpha-therapy. These discoveries facilitate more precise pathogenetic characterisation, reduce diagnostic uncertainty, and expedite translational drug development. This review synthesises current evidence on trigeminal neurogenic inflammation as a mechanistic conduit between migraine biology and GBM progression, mapping cellular circuits, molecular crosstalk, and translational interventions. By integrating neurobiology, oncology, and pharmacology, we aim to delineate diagnostic blind spots, spotlight drug-repurposing opportunities, and chart a roadmap toward personalised strategies that simultaneously alleviate migraine burden and restrain glioblastoma aggressiveness.", "full_text": "Both migraine and glioma contribute substantially to global neurological disability (\nCentral to migraine pathogenesis is trigeminovascular neurogenic inflammation. Electrical or chemical activation of trigeminal nociceptors provokes a rapid antidromic release of vasoactive neuropeptides—chiefly calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)—from perivascular afferents innervating the dura and cortical vessels (\nIntriguingly, each of these neuropeptides also possesses documented oncological bio-activity within the glioma micro-environment (\nRecognising this overlap, the present review interrogates the hypothesis that trigeminal nerve-driven neurogenic inflammation constitutes a mechanistic bridge between migraine biology and GBM progression. We first dissect the cellular and molecular architecture of trigeminal neurogenic inflammation in migraine, then map how the same mediators and signalling nodes orchestrate GBM invasion. By integrating otherwise disparate literatures, we aim to illuminate novel pathophysiological cross-talk and identify therapeutic targets capable of attenuating both migraine burden and glioblastoma aggressiveness.\nAs shown in\nTrigeminovascular neurogenic inflammation as a bridge between migraine and glioblastoma invasion.\nWithin milliseconds of depolarisation, large-dense-core vesicles at the peripheral terminals fuse and discharge a stereotyped cocktail of neuropeptides (\nThe inflammatory milieu that ensues is not neuron-restricted. SP and CGRP trigger rapid degranulation of dural mast cells; histamine, tumour-necrosis factor-α and tryptase released thereby further sensitise afferents and recruit neutrophils and macrophages, perpetuating the cycle (\nCentral amplification follows. Persistent primary-afferent barrage phosphorylates NMDA receptors and ERK1/2 within the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis; activated microglia and astrocytes liberate brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide, sustaining long-term potentiation of nociceptive neurons and manifesting clinically as cutaneous allodynia (\nTrigeminal neurogenic inflammation represents a dynamic, multi-cellular feed-forward loop in which neuropeptide release, vascular dysfunction, immune cell mobilisation and central sensitisation operate in concert. This finely tuned yet pathologically labile circuitry not only underpins migraine pain but also generates a repertoire of cytokines, proteases and growth factors that reshape the local extracellular matrix. Many of these same mediators—CGRP-driven matrix metalloproteinase induction, SP/NK1-R–mediated mitogenic signalling and PACAP-dependent cyclic-AMP modulation—are co-opted by glioblastoma cells to infiltrate neural parenchyma. Understanding the bidirectional dialogue between trigeminal afferents and their vascular–immune partners therefore offers a conceptual bridge between episodic migraine and malignant glioma invasion.\nThe same neuropeptide circuits that ignite trigeminal neurogenic inflammation are increasingly recognised as oncogenic drivers within the glioblastoma (GBM) micro-environment. Transcriptomic and single-cell atlases show that high-grade gliomas over-express both tachykinin and calcitonin-family G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); notably, neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) and the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR, encoded by CALCRL) track with mesenchymal programmes and shortened survival, underscoring their functional relevance to tumour spread (\nSubstance P (SP) signalling exemplifies this hijacking. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that cleave basement-membrane type IV collagen, laminin and proteoglycans; the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 become fully active when surface-trimmed by the membrane-type protease MT1-MMP (MMP-14) and are opposed by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1/-2). This triad is indispensable for GBM cells to tunnel along myelinated white-matter tracts. GBM cells form an autocrine loop in which neuronal or tumour-derived SP engages NK1-R to activate ERK1/2 and PI3K–Akt, culminating in β-arrestin-1 recruitment, cyclin‐dependent kinase activation and accelerated cell-cycle transit. Pharmacologic or genetic blockade of NK1-R curtails SP-driven chemotaxis, while the clinically approved antagonist aprepitant suppresses lamellipodia dynamics and reduces orthotopic tumour burden\nA parallel axis operates through CGRP and its receptor family. Glioblastoma specimens and cell lines display heightened CLR/RAMP2–3 expression, a configuration better known as the adrenomedullin (ADM) receptor. ADM and CGRP ligation elevates intracellular cAMP, trans-activates JNK, and drives cyclin-D1–dependent proliferation; neutralising ADM antibodies or silencing CLR attenuate spheroid outgrowth and invasion in xenograft models (\nPituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) complete this convergence. High-affinity PAC1/VIP receptors are present on patient-derived GBM cultures; PACAP/VIP exposure modulates cAMP-EPAC-Rap1 and MAPK cascades, finely balancing proliferation and motility in a context-dependent manner. In hypoxia (pO\nDownstream, these receptors converge on a protease-rich programme that sculpts the peritumoural matrix. NK1-R and CLR activation heighten transcription and surface trafficking of gelatinases (MMP-2/-9) and MT-MMPs, while concurrently up-regulating αvβ3 integrin and focal-adhesion kinase phosphorylation, which together enable traction through dense parenchyma (\nNeuropeptide signalling also remodels the immune and vascular niches that guide glioma dispersal. SP induces astrocytoma and microglial release of IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF, cytokines that polarise tumour-associated macrophages toward an M2-like, invasion-supportive phenotype and stimulate endothelial VEGF secretion. Single-cell RNA-seq atlases nevertheless identify KIT+ TPSAB1+ mast-cells in < 2% of immune cells at the invasive edge, hinting that a sparse but responsive mast-cell niche may still release histamine and VEGF in reaction to SP or CGRP. In parallel, CGRP-family peptides relax peri-tumoural arterioles, augmenting shear stress and facilitating perivascular migration of tumour cells (\nThe epidemiological intersection between episodic migraine and malignant glioma, while subtle, is increasingly discernible. A nationwide, population-based case-control analysis of more than 22–000 adults showed that patients subsequently diagnosed with brain tumours were 2.45-times more likely to have carried a prior migraine diagnosis; the association remained significant after excluding migraines recorded within three years of tumour detection and was especially pronounced in men (odds ratio 3.04) (\nNeuro-imaging observations lend anatomical plausibility to this overlap.

Aprepitant—licensed for chemotherapy-induced emesis and explored for refractory migraine—induces apoptosis in NK1-R-positive glioma cultures and diminishes Akt phosphorylation\nTaken together, epidemiological signals, radiological patterns and convergent neuropeptide circuitry converge on a common narrative: the trigeminovascular system and its inflammatory mediators do not merely coexist with glioblastoma but actively facilitate its permeation through neural and perivascular channels.\nA growing body of translational evidence positions the trigeminal neuropeptide axis as more than an epiphenomenon of tumour-induced pain; instead, it represents a tractable vulnerability that can be co-targeted to blunt glioblastoma (GBM) infiltration while simultaneously alleviating migraine-like symptomatology. The convergence of CGRP, substance P, PACAP and adrenomedullin signalling on matrix-remodelling, angiogenesis and immune polarisation suggests that pharmacological or radiopharmaceutical interruption of these cues could deliver a double therapeutic dividend.\nRepurposing clinically approved antagonists is the most immediate path to bedside impact. Yet BBB pharmacokinetics diverge sharply: anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (~150 kDa) cross an intact barrier at < 0.1% ID, restricting action to regions of contrast enhancement, whereas the lipophilic NK1-antagonist aprepitant (MW ≈ 534 Da, logP ≈ 3.5) reaches CSF-to-plasma ratios of ~0.05—adequate for receptor occupancy but still sub-therapeutic in deeply infiltrated zones. Moreover, chronic CGRP blockade erodes vasodilatory reserve, slows dermal repair, and may blunt dendritic priming—risks that must be balanced during multimodal therapy. Aprepitant, an oral neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) blocker widely used for chemotherapy-induced nausea, induces apoptosis, suppresses lamellipodial dynamics and synergises with 5-aminolevulinic acid in patient-derived GBM cultures (\nWhere systemic small molecules may falter against the blood-brain barrier, peptide-based radiotheranostics offer focal, high-linear-energy transfer delivery. Targeted α-therapy with NK1-directed peptides has yielded encouraging but still preliminary data: the largest 225Ac-DOTA-Substance P dose-escalation study (n = 21, median 3 cycles) reported grade-3 thrombocytopenia in 1/21 patients and a median overall survival (OS) of 9.0 months from first dose, with RANO responses limited to one partial response and seven cases of stable disease.

Aprepitant, an oral neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) blocker widely used for chemotherapy-induced nausea, induces apoptosis, suppresses lamellipodial dynamics and synergises with 5-aminolevulinic acid in patient-derived GBM cultures (\nWhere systemic small molecules may falter against the blood-brain barrier, peptide-based radiotheranostics offer focal, high-linear-energy transfer delivery. Targeted α-therapy with NK1-directed peptides has yielded encouraging but still preliminary data: the largest 225Ac-DOTA-Substance P dose-escalation study (n = 21, median 3 cycles) reported grade-3 thrombocytopenia in 1/21 patients and a median overall survival (OS) of 9.0 months from first dose, with RANO responses limited to one partial response and seven cases of stable disease. An earlier 213Bi-DOTA-Substance P trial (n = 20, cumulative activity ≤ 11.2 GBq) recorded only transient grade 1/2 toxicities and a 7.5-month median OS from therapy start, again with low objective-response rates (\nAdrenomedullin, a close CGRP family member, exemplifies the broader potential of neuropeptide blockade.

Growing evidence shows that endogenous NSCs in mammals and humans can shift between quiescence and active proliferation, supporting neurogenesis and gliogenesis during inflammatory CNS disorders (Martino and Pluchino\nRecent studies on inflammatory CNS disorders suggest that dysfunction within the microenvironmental niches where NSCs reside may be responsible for their inability to achieve full restoration (Pluchino et al.\nVarious regenerative approaches have been explored to prevent disease progression and enhance repair mechanisms by targeting the CNS microenvironment. Therapies that can directly or indirectly target the niche microenvironment to restore NSC behavior and promote neuronal regeneration could have a significant impact on the treatment of inflammatory CNS disorders (Martino and Pluchino\nNSCs exert many of their biological effects through their secretome, notably via EVs—nano‐ to micro‐sized, lipid bilayer‐enclosed particles that are secreted by cells and lack replication capacity (Welsh et al.\nEVs are broadly classified based on size, biogenesis, and composition into three main subtypes: exosomes (30–150 nm), which are formed within the endosomal pathway and released through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane; microvesicles (100–1000 nm), also known as ectosomes, which originate by direct outward budding of the plasma membrane; and apoptotic bodies (50–4000 nm), which are shed from cells undergoing programmed cell death and contain nuclear fragments and organelles (Welsh et al.\nBeyond the canonical subtypes, additional vesicular and non‐vesicular extracellular particles have been described, reflecting the expanding complexity of intercellular communication. These include ARMMS (arrestin domain‐containing protein 1‐mediated microvesicles) involved in Notch signaling; migrasomes, which bud from retraction fibers of migrating cells and mediate tissue remodeling; and exophers, which expel damaged cellular components under stress (Wang et al.\nConsistent with the minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles (MISEV) 2023 guidelines, we avoid using terms such as “\nThe unique and multifunctional ability of EVs to influence multiple biological pathways makes them particularly attractive candidates for addressing the complex pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. By modulating the microenvironment of the CNS, NSC‐derived EVs have emerged as a promising cell‐free biotherapeutic strategy, capable of replicating many of the beneficial effects of NSC transplantation while circumventing challenges related to cell survival, immune rejection, and tumorigenic risk. Particularly compelling is their ability to mediate neuroimmune interactions, promote neural repair, and modulate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. These vesicles have been shown to influence key pathophysiological processes in both neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions, including neuroprotection, immune regulation, synaptic plasticity, and tissue regeneration.\nHere we will explore recent advances in biotherapeutic approaches for treating neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on NSC‐derived EVs. It will delve into their mechanisms of action, particularly their role in modulating inflammatory pathways, neuroprotection, and neurometabolic support, while also discussing recent progress in preclinical and clinical applications. Furthermore, we will critically examine the challenges associated with the clinical translation of NSC‐derived EVs. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to highlight the therapeutic frontiers of NSC‐derived EVs in treating neurodegenerative diseases and advancing neural regeneration.\nIn recent years, several innovative biotherapeutic strategies have emerged to promote neural repair by either activating the brain's intrinsic regenerative capacity or introducing exogenous sources of support. Although significant progress has been made—using neurotrophic factors, neutralizing antibodies, gene therapy, biomaterials, and cell‐based therapies—major challenges remain that limit the clinical translation of these approaches.\nThis section explores both avenues: enhancing endogenous repair mechanisms and employing exogenous interventions to highlight current advances and future directions in CNS regeneration. Finally, the unique advantages of NSC‐derived EVs and their potential to overcome the limitations of existing regenerative strategies will be outlined.\nExperimental studies have identified key populations (Figure\nLimited endogenous repair potential and main strategies for neural regeneration. (a) Main stem cell‐like populations in the adult brain include neural stem cells (NSCs) or ependymal cells (ECs) located in neurogenic niches such as the subventricular zone (SVZ), subgranular zone (SGZ), amygdala, striatum, cortex, and hypothalamus. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are distributed throughout the brain and contribute to myelination and neural repair. Perivascular mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and pericytes reside in the vascular niche, while brain endothelial cells (BECs) within the blood–brain barrier (BBB) exhibit progenitor‐like properties. (b) Endogenous stem cells possess self‐renewal capacity and multipotency, enabling neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Their function is tightly regulated by the microenvironment, including soluble factors (cytokines, neurotrophins), extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying signaling molecules and mitochondria, and neuroimmune interactions. However, their repair capacity is inherently limited and declines with aging, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunctions. (c) Advanced therapeutic approaches aim to overcome the limitations of endogenous repair mechanisms. These include:\nAmong these, NSCs stand out as the most therapeutically versatile population due to several distinguishing features. They possess a tripotent differentiation capacity, allowing them to generate neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes—essential for comprehensive neural repair. NSCs are also highly responsive to environmental cues, enabling dynamic adaptation to injury or disease (Pourabdolhossein et al.\nThese features have positioned NSCs as a central focus in neuroregenerative strategies. However, endogenous NSCs in the adult human CNS are largely restricted to specific neurogenic niches and remain predominantly in a quiescent state under physiological conditions. Another major factor is the limited quantity of NSCs in endogenous pools, which may prove insufficient for addressing extensive damage, such as stroke (Bian et al.\nMetabolic imbalances can disrupt nutrient‐sensing pathways crucial for NSC fate and neurogenesis (Fidaleo et al.\nThese challenges underscore the need to develop strategies that can enhance the regenerative potential of endogenous NSCs (Figure\nSome advances in targeting endogenous pools include the use of neurotrophic factors, neutralizing antibodies targeting endogenous molecules within the microenvironment that inhibit CNS repair, gene therapy for cell‐target DNA repair, in situ‐directed reprogramming of CNS cells, and the development of biomaterials to modify the disrupted CNS extracellular matrix (Zamproni et al.\nMoreover, in vivo and in situ neuronal conversion of CNS cells—such as astrocytes (Barker et al.\nTo enhance the limited endogenous repair capacity, various cell types have been transplanted in different neurological conditions. These primarily include NSCs or glial‐restricted progenitors derived from ESCs or iPSCs, iNSCs, MSCs, and more recently, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR‐T cells) (Bonafede and Mariotti\nNSCs have garnered significant interest as potential biotherapeutics for neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases due to their expandability, ability to integrate into existing neuroglial elements, and capacity to promote functional repair (Mozafari et al.\nPreclinical studies on myelin diseases reveal that, when administered intraparenchymally, iPSC‐derived NSCs differentiate into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes and, to a lesser extent, into astrocytes or neurons in the adult CNS (Mozafari and Baron‐Van Evercooren\nAt the clinical level, several trials have explored the feasibility, safety, and early efficacy of NSC transplantation for various neurological conditions, with promising results (Table\nSummary of clinical trials using neural stem cell transplantation in neurological disorders.\nChronic Thoracic SCI\n(\nTraumatic Cervical SCI\n(KCT0000879)\nP‐MS\n(\nP‐MS\n(\nALS\n(\nI (1.5 years)\nI (2–2.5 years)\nALS\n(\n\nAbbreviations: ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALS‐FRS‐R, ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised; CNS10‐NPC‐GDNF, human neural progenitor cells genetically modified to express glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF); CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; hfNPCs, human fetal neural progenitor cells; hNSCs, human neural stem cells; hNSPCs, human neural stem/progenitor cells; ICV, intracerebroventricular; I/IIa, clinical trial phases I and IIa; intraspinal, direct injection into the spinal cord; intrathecal, delivery into the spinal canal; KCT, Korea Clinical Trial Registry; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; MS, multiple sclerosis;\nAlthough NSC transplantation has shown promise in preclinical and early clinical studies by promoting neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and structural repair, its broader clinical translation remains limited by challenges such as immunogenicity, tumorigenicity, invasive delivery routes, and poor graft survival or integration. To address these limitations, increasing attention has turned toward harnessing the regenerative and immunomodulatory functions of transplanted cells through their secretome—particularly EVs. NSC‐derived EVs offer a compelling cell‐free alternative that retains many of the therapeutic effects of NSCs—such as the delivery of neurotrophic factors, immunomodulators, and even functional mitochondria—while avoiding the risks associated with cell‐based therapies. The following section details the advantages of NSC‐EV‐based biotherapy, including low immunogenicity, BBB penetration, neurotropism, and safety, combined with the functional sophistication of their parental cells, positioning them as a next‐generation regenerative platform for CNS repair.\nEVs represent a potent mechanism of action in various cell transplantation studies. EVs derived from diverse cell sources have been explored for the treatment of various neurological disorders (Putthanbut et al.\nAmong the diverse EV sources explored, those derived from MSCs and NSCs—for some similar reasons that make these cell types attractive in transplantation—are particularly compelling for neurological therapies due to their greater accessibility and well‐established regenerative, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties, rendering them more clinically translatable than EVs from many other CNS‐resident cell types (Hermann et al.\nSummary of current cell‐free therapies based on EVs for neurological disorders.\n↑ cortical layer development; ↑ deep‐layer neurons;\n↑ resilience to cellular stress\n\nAbbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; ANT1/2, adenine nucleotide translocase 1 and 2; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; BAG3, Bcl‐2‐associated athanogene 3; BBB, blood–brain barrier; CNS, central nervous system; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (a mouse model of multiple sclerosis); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EVs, extracellular vesicles; HSPB8, heat shock protein beta‐8; HT22, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line; KO, knockout; LC3B‐II, microtubule‐associated protein 1A/1B‐light chain 3B‐II (autophagy marker); miR, microRNA; MS, multiple sclerosis; MSCs, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; PD, Parkinson's disease; PNI, peripheral nerve injury; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SIRT2, sirtuin 2 (a NAD‐dependent deacetylase); TBI, traumatic brain injury; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; VM, ventral midbrain.\nWhile MSC‐derived EVs offer broad immunomodulatory and regenerative benefits, NSC‐derived EVs stand out for their specialized roles in neurodevelopment and circuit repair, making them particularly promising for neurodegenerative diseases. These EVs possess intrinsic neurogenic potential, are enriched with neurotrophic factors, and have been shown to enhance synaptic plasticity and cognitive function (Volpe et al.\nNSC‐derived EVs offer different therapeutic benefits of NSCs without the complexities of cell transplantation, avoiding issues like cell survival, engraftment, and differentiation. EVs derived from NSCs do not carry the same risks of uncontrolled cell proliferation, tumor formation, or improper integration associated with live cell transplants (Li et al.\nNSC‐derived EVs can protect neurons through enhancing the expression of antioxidant enzymes and reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which rescue mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases (Li et al.\nCollectively, these properties highlight NSC‐derived EVs as a promising cell‐free therapeutic approach, offering neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and regeneration while also having the potential to be used as off‐the‐shelf products, thereby circumventing the challenges associated with direct NSC transplantation.\nAccumulating evidence from preclinical animal studies suggests that NSC‐derived EVs have significant and translatable therapeutic potential, which, with further mechanistic insights, could reshape the current treatment paradigm for neurological conditions, particularly age‐associated CNS disorders. These studies have demonstrated substantial global phenotypic improvement, including immunological, physiological, and behavioral outcomes, in the animal groups treated with NSC‐derived EVs.\nMoreover, preclinical findings suggest that NSC‐derived EVs mitigate key hallmarks of diseases, notably reducing neuroinflammation, lesion volume, neuronal loss, demyelination, and protein aggregation while enhancing neuroprotection, metabolic function, and synaptic activity (Madhu et al.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of action of NSC‐derived EVs can help identify specific molecular targets, enabling their engineering and further enhancing their therapeutic efficacy and potential as biotherapeutic agents. Mechanistic studies show that NSC‐derived EVs offer multiple therapeutic advantages, including modulating neuroinflammation, promoting neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, restoring cellular metabolism, and protecting against neurodegeneration.\nThe potential capacity of NSC‐derived EVs to promote neurogenesis and gliogenesis has fundamental roles for the replacement of cell loss associated with neurodegenerative diseases and also to switch aging‐associated quiescent NSCs to an active status and stimulate the formation of new neurons and glial cells (Ruetz et al.\nIn a study using EVs derived from NSCs, the authors have shown that EVs have the potential to buffer the effect induced by H\nNSC‐derived EVs can also regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation after spinal cord injury via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Upregulating acid‐sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1A) in NSCs raises the activity of prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which causes EVs with high PGE2 levels to be released. These EVs act in a paracrine way and inhibit NSC differentiation into oligodendrocytes. Blocking ASIC1A or PTGS2 reduces PGE2 in EVs, reversing this inhibition and promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation (Wu et al.\nMultimodal mechanisms of action of NSC‐EVs. (a) NSC‐EVs enhance neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation through miRNA‐mediated regulation, ERK signaling, and protection against oxidative stress. They also influence oligodendrocyte differentiation via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling. (b) NSC‐EVs regulate inflammatory responses via various molecular pathways. They transfer IFN‐γ to activate Stat1 signaling in target cells and suppress microglial activation through miRNA‐mediated mechanisms. NSC‐EVs also mitigate inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) via YBX1 and autophagy‐mediated pathways, reducing pro‐inflammatory cytokine expression. (c) NSC‐EVs protect against oxidative stress, preserve mitochondrial function by transferring intact mitochondria, regulate metabolic homeostasis, and counteract neurotoxic astrocyte activation. Additionally, NSC‐EVs suppress microglial reactivity, modulate inflammatory pathways, and mitigate aging‐associated neurodegenerative processes. Together, these multimodal actions highlight the therapeutic potential of NSC‐derived EVs in CNS repair and regeneration. Created by BioRender.\nCurrent studies have demonstrated that NSC‐derived EVs are an important modulator of neuroinflammation, acting through diverse mechanisms in target cells. For example, EVs from NSCs transfer IFN‐γ via Ifngr1 to activate Stat1 signaling and induce specific activation of pro‐inflammatory cytokine signaling in fibroblast cell lines (Cossetti et al.\nIn microglia, EVs from NSCs seemed to exert an anti‐inflammatory role via miRNAs. Accordingly, knockdown of NSC‐derived EV‐enriched miRNAs (including let‐7i, miR‐21a, and miR‐10b) significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of EVs on Aβ‐induced microglial activation in animal models of AD (Gao et al.\nEVs from NSCs can also promote anti‐inflammatory function, regulating the mechanisms of cellular death (Peng et al.\nMoreover, EV treatment increased the expression of the autophagy marker proteins LC3B and beclin‐1 and promoted autophagosome formation in spinal neurons after SCI. This comes together with upregulated expression of the anti‐apoptotic protein Bcl‐2 and reduced expression levels of the pro‐apoptotic protein Bax, the apoptosis effector cleaved caspase‐3 (Rong et al.\nAdditionally, Rong et al. reported that NSC‐derived EV pretreatment inhibits microglial activation (lower number of CD68+ microglia near the injury site) and reduces neuroinflammation, exhibiting lower RNA and protein expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IL‐6). In the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3‐Methyladenine (3MA), all these protective effects of EVs on spinal neurons and microglia were reversed (Rong et al.\nMoreover, hiPSC‐NSC‐EVs have shown promise in mitigating Aβ‐24o‐induced neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo in an AD mouse model by reducing neuroinflammation, amyloid plaques, and tau phosphorylation, leading to improved cognitive and mood functions (Rao et al.\nAll in all, NSC‐derived EVs can modulate neuroinflammation and promote neuronal survival by regulating miRNAs, cell death pathways (such as pyroptosis and apoptosis), and autophagy in models of neurodegenerative diseases and injury (Figure\nOne approach for ameliorating and delaying the progression of aging and the age‐associated neurodegenerative diseases is to promote neuroprotection, that is, an effect that may result in the salvage, recovery, or regeneration of the nervous system, its cells, structure, and function (Vajda\nMost preclinical studies highlight the neuroprotective role of NSC‐derived EVs, with mechanistic studies illustrating how these EVs can mitigate the effects of aging and the hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. As discussed in the previous section, research by Ma et al. and Ocana et al. has already shown the neuroprotective potential of iNSC‐ and NSC‐derived EVs, particularly in oxidative stress conditions that promote cell apoptosis (Ma, Li, et al.\nAnother key aspect of neuroprotection is the regulation of critical nutrient concentrations and the modification of the microenvironment's physiology, which helps support neuronal health and function (Iraci et al.\nFurther to improve microenvironment nutrients, cellular metabolism, and stress tolerance, EVs from NSCs could safeguard cells from neurotoxic substances, such as long‐chain saturated fatty acids secreted by reactive astrocytes (Li, Zhang, et al.\nAnother way NSC‐derived EVs promote neuroprotection is by mitigating hallmarks of the aging process, since many of these neurodegenerative conditions exhibit aging‐associated pathological pathways or are exacerbated by the aging process (Nicaise et al.\nIn an experimental model of brain insulin resistance (BIR)‐dependent cognitive impairment induced by insulin‐resistant NSCs, mice fed a high‐fat diet (HFD) showed reduced NSC proliferation and increased senescence of self‐renewing cells, as assessed by double‐labelling with BrdU and the immature neuron marker DCX (Natale et al.\nCollectively, these studies summarized in Table\nSummary of recent advances in NSC‐derived EV‐based therapies in neurological conditions.\n↑ Dopaminergic neuron survival,\n↓ ROS accumulation, apoptosis, and necrosis; catalase delivery confirmed\nNo significant effect under normal neurogenesis conditions.\nAfter Ara‐C–mediated NPC proliferation inhibition, NPC‐EVs improved neurological scores and reduced infarct volume\nIn vivo: Mouse model of status epilepticus\nIn vitro: macrophage inflammatory model\nIV and\nin vitro OGD/R\n↓ IFNβ, ↓ ELOVL1, ↓ saturated lipids; ↓ astrocyte neurotoxicity; ↓ neuronal apoptosis; motor recovery; ↓ lipid‐induced lipoapoptosis; BBB permeable.\nAlso compared NSC‐EVs with MSC‐EVs in vitro and in vivo; NSC‐EVs demonstrated superior anti‐neurotoxic astrocyte activity\n\nAbbreviations: 3MA, 3‐methyladenine; 5xFAD, transgenic mouse model carrying five familial Alzheimer's disease mutations; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ANT1/2, adenine nucleotide translocase 1 and 2; Ara‐C, cytosine arabinoside; ASIC1A, acid‐sensing ion channel subunit 1A; Aβ, amyloid‐beta peptide; BBB, blood–brain barrier; Beclin‐1, autophagy‐related protein; Catalase, antioxidant enzyme; CNS, central nervous system; COX‐2, cyclooxygenase‐2; E13, embryonic day 13; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ELOVL1, elongation of very long‐chain fatty acids protein 1; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase; EVs, extracellular vesicles; FGF2, fibroblast growth factor 2; FoxO, forkhead box O; GFs, growth factors; GPR30, G‐protein–coupled estrogen receptor 30; hfNSCs, human fetal neural stem cells; hiPSC‐NSCs, human‐induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neural stem cells; HT22, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line; I/R, ischemia–reperfusion; IC, intracerebral; ICV, intracerebroventricular; IFN‐1/IFNβ, interferon type I/beta; IGF2, insulin‐like growth factor 2; IL‐1β, interleukin‐1 beta; IN, intranasal; IRS‐1, insulin receptor substrate 1; KO, knockout; LC3B, microtubule‐associated protein 1A/1B‐light chain 3B (autophagy marker); LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MDA, malondialdehyde; mENPCs, mouse embryonic neural progenitor cells; miNSCs, induced neural stem cells; miR, microRNA; mNPCs, mouse neural progenitor cells; mNSCs, mouse neural stem cells; mSVZ, mouse subventricular zone; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; NLRP3, nucleotide‐binding oligomerization domain‐like receptor protein 3; NPCs, neural progenitor cells; NSPCs, neural stem/progenitor cells; OGD/R, oxygen–glucose deprivation/reperfusion; PD, Parkinson's disease; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; Prdx2, peroxiredoxin‐2; PTGS2, prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX‐2); rfNSCs, rat fetal neural stem cells; rNSCs, rat neural stem cells; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SCI, spinal cord injury; SH‐SY5Y, human neuroblastoma cell line; SPOP, speckle‐type POZ protein; SVZ, subventricular zone; Tau, microtubule‐associated protein tau; tMCAO, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; Txn, thioredoxin; WT, wild‐type; YBX1, Y‐box binding protein 1.\nEncouraged by robust preclinical results, the field is now progressing toward early‐phase clinical trials using NSC‐EVs. However, the transition from bench to bedside remains far from straightforward. Despite their therapeutic promise, NSC‐EVs face substantial technological and regulatory hurdles that limit their clinical translation from bench to market. A key challenge is the large‐scale, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)‐compliant production of NSC‐EVs, constrained by the limited availability of high‐quality NSC sources and the absence of standardized protocols for EV isolation, purification, and characterization. Common methods such as ultracentrifugation and tangential flow filtration often fail to ensure high yield and batch‐to‐batch consistency—both essential for clinical‐grade manufacturing (Sanz‐Ros et al.\nTo overcome these bottlenecks, advances in engineering and biomanufacturing are gaining traction. Techniques such as electroporation, transfection, and membrane fusion are being employed to enhance EV cargo loading, while surface modification with targeting peptides or antibodies improves delivery specificity. These engineering strategies, combined with scalable GMP‐compliant production systems, offer promising solutions to current limitations in yield and targeting (Ma et al.\nA search was performed on\nOngoing clinical trials of iNSC‐derived EVs in neurological disorders.\nThe Safety and Efficacy of NouvSoma001 in Ischemic Stroke\n(\nThe Safety and Efficacy of NouvSoma001 in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders\n(\n\nAbbreviations: EVs, extracellular vesicles; IV, intravenous; NCT, National Clinical Trial (identifier); NMOSD, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder; NouvSoma001, human‐induced NSC‐derived extracellular vesicles; NSC, neural stem cell; Phase I, first‐in‐human clinical trial phase focusing on safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy.\nThe translation of the NSC‐derived EV biotherapeutic approach into clinical practice remains constrained by a range of scientific, technical, and regulatory challenges. Among these are issues related to the standardization of EV production and characterization, heterogeneity, scalability for clinical‐grade manufacturing, delivery across the BBB, and long‐term safety. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of EVs is closely tied to the biological profile of their parental NSCs, making the choice of cell source a critical determinant of success.\nEV characteristics are largely determined by the properties of their parent cells. Selecting an appropriate NSC source requires careful evaluation of several factors, including donor compatibility (autologous vs. allogeneic), tumorigenic factors, population purity and homogeneity, and the specific disease context (focal vs. multifocal or widespread). NSCs can be derived from various regions of the brain or spinal cord, from fetal or adult tissues, or through direct reprogramming of ES or iPS cells—each yielding EVs with distinct molecular signatures and functional capacities. Therefore, NSC source selection must be tailored to the specific neurological condition being targeted.\nHistorically, human NSCs isolated from fetal tissues have been a common source of EVs due to their ability to differentiate into a range of neural lineages and their therapeutic potential (Willis, Nicaise, Peruzzotti‐Jametti, and Pluchino\nFurthermore, EVs derived from NSCs of different brain regions may also vary in their therapeutic effects. For instance, EVs from a human fetal NSC line displayed neuroprotective properties against oxidative stress in vitro, while hypothalamic NSC‐derived EVs demonstrated endocrine‐like effects, influencing neurogenesis and systemic aging in mice (Bonetto and Grilli\nNSC‐derived EVs, even when produced from a similar cell source, represent a highly heterogeneous population with diverse molecular cargo, physical properties, and biological functions—posing significant challenges for their clinical standardization (Peruzzotti‐Jametti et al.\nTo address these limitations, several promising approaches have emerged. First, subpopulation isolation techniques such as microfluidics, size‐exclusion chromatography, and immunoaffinity capture using markers like CD63 or NCAM can help obtain functionally uniform EV subsets for therapeutic use (Zhang, Huang, et al.\nCollectively, these strategies provide a rational roadmap to overcome NSC‐EV heterogeneity and facilitate their safe, consistent, and effective application in CNS therapeutics.\nBeyond the need for production and characterization standardization, optimization of storage and downstream handling is also critical for the clinical translation of NSC‐derived EVs. In relation to optimization of storage conditions, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) recommends that EVs be conserved in isotonic buffers to prevent pH shifts during storage as well as during freezing and thawing procedures and stored at −80°C (Welsh et al.\nTreating CNS diseases with EVs is particularly challenging due to the presence of the BBB; therefore, various delivery methods are currently under investigation. The most effective approach for delivering NSC‐derived EVs across different neurological conditions needs to be optimized in a disease‐specific manner. Common delivery strategies include (a) intranasal administration, which allows rapid CNS absorption; (b) intravascular microbubbles combined with focused ultrasound to transiently open the BBB; (c) oral delivery of plant‐, milk‐, or bacteria‐derived EVs, which have been shown to reach the brain in some studies; (d) intravenous injection, though limited by short circulation time and rapid clearance; (e) intraperitoneal injection, which allows for high local uptake; and (f) subcutaneous injection, which shows minimal brain delivery. More invasive approaches include (g–h) intrathecal or intraventricular injection into the CSF, and (i) direct injection into specific brain regions or tumors (Nieland et al.\nWith advancements in EV isolation and enhanced cell specificity, EVs hold great promise for tissue‐specific applications by enabling targeted therapy delivery, improving treatment efficacy, and minimizing side effects (Zhang, Wu, et al.\nNevertheless, ethical and regulatory challenges remain significant considerations in the development of EV‐based therapies. The ISEV emphasizes that EV therapies are subject to regulations governing “tissues and cells” and “advanced therapy medicinal products” (ATMPs) (Lener et al.\nAltogether, despite the significant promise of NSC‐derived EVs for neurological therapy, several challenges must be addressed before their widespread clinical application. Key challenges include optimizing NSC sources, standardizing EV isolation and characterization, scaling up production while ensuring quality, and evaluating long‐term safety. Refining delivery strategies and advancing EV bioengineering, storage, and regulatory frameworks are essential for translating NSC‐EVs into clinically viable off‐the‐shelf therapies.\nThe CNS has limited regenerative capacity, with NSCs residing in neurogenic zones playing a role in self‐repair. While they hold promise for treating neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, their endogenous repair capacity is often insufficient, particularly with aging, which compromises neurogenesis and contributes to disease progression. Dysfunction within the NSC niche, influenced by inflammation and environmental factors, further limits their regenerative potential. Approaches such as neurotrophic factors, gene therapy, and in vivo glial reprogramming show promise but face clinical challenges.\nNSCs can be sourced from embryonic, fetal, or adult tissues, or reprogrammed from somatic cells. Despite promising preclinical and early clinical data in MS, ALS, and PD, challenges such as ethical concerns, tumorigenicity, and donor compatibility remain. NSC‐derived EVs, serving as a potent mechanism of action in NSC therapy, represent a promising cell‐free biotherapeutic approach due to their intrinsic neurogenic potential, offering advantages over cell therapy such as reduced immunogenicity and enhanced targeting capabilities. They provide neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and metabolic support, promoting neural regeneration in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases.\nPreclinical studies show that NSC‐EVs can mitigate neurodegeneration, reduce oxidative stress, and support mitochondrial function—modulating multiple pathways critical to CNS repair. Ongoing clinical trials underscore their potential as scalable, off‐the‐shelf therapeutics for stroke and neuroimmune disorders. However, translating NSC‐EVs into clinical therapies will require significant progress in optimizing delivery strategies, refining bioengineering approaches, and establishing comprehensive safety profiles. Key challenges include minimizing EV heterogeneity and off‐target effects, ensuring the long‐term safety of repeated administration, and eliminating unintended cargo such as oncogenic miRNAs or pro‐inflammatory cytokines. Clinical success will depend on a coordinated, multidisciplinary effort—integrating advanced bioengineering, standardized analytical methods, rigorous safety testing, and harmonized global regulatory frameworks.

Growing evidence shows that endogenous NSCs in mammals and humans can shift between quiescence and active proliferation, supporting neurogenesis and gliogenesis during inflammatory CNS disorders (Martino and Pluchino\nRecent studies on inflammatory CNS disorders suggest that dysfunction within the microenvironmental niches where NSCs reside may be responsible for their inability to achieve full restoration (Pluchino et al.\nVarious regenerative approaches have been explored to prevent disease progression and enhance repair mechanisms by targeting the CNS microenvironment. Therapies that can directly or indirectly target the niche microenvironment to restore NSC behavior and promote neuronal regeneration could have a significant impact on the treatment of inflammatory CNS disorders (Martino and Pluchino\nNSCs exert many of their biological effects through their secretome, notably via EVs—nano‐ to micro‐sized, lipid bilayer‐enclosed particles that are secreted by cells and lack replication capacity (Welsh et al.\nEVs are broadly classified based on size, biogenesis, and composition into three main subtypes: exosomes (30–150 nm), which are formed within the endosomal pathway and released through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane; microvesicles (100–1000 nm), also known as ectosomes, which originate by direct outward budding of the plasma membrane; and apoptotic bodies (50–4000 nm), which are shed from cells undergoing programmed cell death and contain nuclear fragments and organelles (Welsh et al.\nBeyond the canonical subtypes, additional vesicular and non‐vesicular extracellular particles have been described, reflecting the expanding complexity of intercellular communication. These include ARMMS (arrestin domain‐containing protein 1‐mediated microvesicles) involved in Notch signaling; migrasomes, which bud from retraction fibers of migrating cells and mediate tissue remodeling; and exophers, which expel damaged cellular components under stress (Wang et al.\nConsistent with the minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles (MISEV) 2023 guidelines, we avoid using terms such as “\nThe unique and multifunctional ability of EVs to influence multiple biological pathways makes them particularly attractive candidates for addressing the complex pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. By modulating the microenvironment of the CNS, NSC‐derived EVs have emerged as a promising cell‐free biotherapeutic strategy, capable of replicating many of the beneficial effects of NSC transplantation while circumventing challenges related to cell survival, immune rejection, and tumorigenic risk. Particularly compelling is their ability to mediate neuroimmune interactions, promote neural repair, and modulate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. These vesicles have been shown to influence key pathophysiological processes in both neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions, including neuroprotection, immune regulation, synaptic plasticity, and tissue regeneration.\nHere we will explore recent advances in biotherapeutic approaches for treating neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on NSC‐derived EVs. It will delve into their mechanisms of action, particularly their role in modulating inflammatory pathways, neuroprotection, and neurometabolic support, while also discussing recent progress in preclinical and clinical applications. Furthermore, we will critically examine the challenges associated with the clinical translation of NSC‐derived EVs. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to highlight the therapeutic frontiers of NSC‐derived EVs in treating neurodegenerative diseases and advancing neural regeneration.\nIn recent years, several innovative biotherapeutic strategies have emerged to promote neural repair by either activating the brain's intrinsic regenerative capacity or introducing exogenous sources of support. Although significant progress has been made—using neurotrophic factors, neutralizing antibodies, gene therapy, biomaterials, and cell‐based therapies—major challenges remain that limit the clinical translation of these approaches.\nThis section explores both avenues: enhancing endogenous repair mechanisms and employing exogenous interventions to highlight current advances and future directions in CNS regeneration. Finally, the unique advantages of NSC‐derived EVs and their potential to overcome the limitations of existing regenerative strategies will be outlined.\nExperimental studies have identified key populations (Figure\nLimited endogenous repair potential and main strategies for neural regeneration. (a) Main stem cell‐like populations in the adult brain include neural stem cells (NSCs) or ependymal cells (ECs) located in neurogenic niches such as the subventricular zone (SVZ), subgranular zone (SGZ), amygdala, striatum, cortex, and hypothalamus. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are distributed throughout the brain and contribute to myelination and neural repair. Perivascular mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and pericytes reside in the vascular niche, while brain endothelial cells (BECs) within the blood–brain barrier (BBB) exhibit progenitor‐like properties. (b) Endogenous stem cells possess self‐renewal capacity and multipotency, enabling neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Their function is tightly regulated by the microenvironment, including soluble factors (cytokines, neurotrophins), extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying signaling molecules and mitochondria, and neuroimmune interactions. However, their repair capacity is inherently limited and declines with aging, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunctions. (c) Advanced therapeutic approaches aim to overcome the limitations of endogenous repair mechanisms. These include:\nAmong these, NSCs stand out as the most therapeutically versatile population due to several distinguishing features. They possess a tripotent differentiation capacity, allowing them to generate neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes—essential for comprehensive neural repair. NSCs are also highly responsive to environmental cues, enabling dynamic adaptation to injury or disease (Pourabdolhossein et al.\nThese features have positioned NSCs as a central focus in neuroregenerative strategies. However, endogenous NSCs in the adult human CNS are largely restricted to specific neurogenic niches and remain predominantly in a quiescent state under physiological conditions. Another major factor is the limited quantity of NSCs in endogenous pools, which may prove insufficient for addressing extensive damage, such as stroke (Bian et al.\nMetabolic imbalances can disrupt nutrient‐sensing pathways crucial for NSC fate and neurogenesis (Fidaleo et al.\nThese challenges underscore the need to develop strategies that can enhance the regenerative potential of endogenous NSCs (Figure\nSome advances in targeting endogenous pools include the use of neurotrophic factors, neutralizing antibodies targeting endogenous molecules within the microenvironment that inhibit CNS repair, gene therapy for cell‐target DNA repair, in situ‐directed reprogramming of CNS cells, and the development of biomaterials to modify the disrupted CNS extracellular matrix (Zamproni et al.\nMoreover, in vivo and in situ neuronal conversion of CNS cells—such as astrocytes (Barker et al.\nTo enhance the limited endogenous repair capacity, various cell types have been transplanted in different neurological conditions. These primarily include NSCs or glial‐restricted progenitors derived from ESCs or iPSCs, iNSCs, MSCs, and more recently, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR‐T cells) (Bonafede and Mariotti\nNSCs have garnered significant interest as potential biotherapeutics for neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases due to their expandability, ability to integrate into existing neuroglial elements, and capacity to promote functional repair (Mozafari et al.\nPreclinical studies on myelin diseases reveal that, when administered intraparenchymally, iPSC‐derived NSCs differentiate into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes and, to a lesser extent, into astrocytes or neurons in the adult CNS (Mozafari and Baron‐Van Evercooren\nAt the clinical level, several trials have explored the feasibility, safety, and early efficacy of NSC transplantation for various neurological conditions, with promising results (Table\nSummary of clinical trials using neural stem cell transplantation in neurological disorders.\nChronic Thoracic SCI\n(\nTraumatic Cervical SCI\n(KCT0000879)\nP‐MS\n(\nP‐MS\n(\nALS\n(\nI (1.5 years)\nI (2–2.5 years)\nALS\n(\n\nAbbreviations: ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ALS‐FRS‐R, ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised; CNS10‐NPC‐GDNF, human neural progenitor cells genetically modified to express glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF); CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; hfNPCs, human fetal neural progenitor cells; hNSCs, human neural stem cells; hNSPCs, human neural stem/progenitor cells; ICV, intracerebroventricular; I/IIa, clinical trial phases I and IIa; intraspinal, direct injection into the spinal cord; intrathecal, delivery into the spinal canal; KCT, Korea Clinical Trial Registry; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; MS, multiple sclerosis;\nAlthough NSC transplantation has shown promise in preclinical and early clinical studies by promoting neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and structural repair, its broader clinical translation remains limited by challenges such as immunogenicity, tumorigenicity, invasive delivery routes, and poor graft survival or integration. To address these limitations, increasing attention has turned toward harnessing the regenerative and immunomodulatory functions of transplanted cells through their secretome—particularly EVs. NSC‐derived EVs offer a compelling cell‐free alternative that retains many of the therapeutic effects of NSCs—such as the delivery of neurotrophic factors, immunomodulators, and even functional mitochondria—while avoiding the risks associated with cell‐based therapies. The following section details the advantages of NSC‐EV‐based biotherapy, including low immunogenicity, BBB penetration, neurotropism, and safety, combined with the functional sophistication of their parental cells, positioning them as a next‐generation regenerative platform for CNS repair.\nEVs represent a potent mechanism of action in various cell transplantation studies. EVs derived from diverse cell sources have been explored for the treatment of various neurological disorders (Putthanbut et al.\nAmong the diverse EV sources explored, those derived from MSCs and NSCs—for some similar reasons that make these cell types attractive in transplantation—are particularly compelling for neurological therapies due to their greater accessibility and well‐established regenerative, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties, rendering them more clinically translatable than EVs from many other CNS‐resident cell types (Hermann et al.\nSummary of current cell‐free therapies based on EVs for neurological disorders.\n↑ cortical layer development; ↑ deep‐layer neurons;\n↑ resilience to cellular stress\n\nAbbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; ANT1/2, adenine nucleotide translocase 1 and 2; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; BAG3, Bcl‐2‐associated athanogene 3; BBB, blood–brain barrier; CNS, central nervous system; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (a mouse model of multiple sclerosis); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EVs, extracellular vesicles; HSPB8, heat shock protein beta‐8; HT22, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line; KO, knockout; LC3B‐II, microtubule‐associated protein 1A/1B‐light chain 3B‐II (autophagy marker); miR, microRNA; MS, multiple sclerosis; MSCs, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; PD, Parkinson's disease; PNI, peripheral nerve injury; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SIRT2, sirtuin 2 (a NAD‐dependent deacetylase); TBI, traumatic brain injury; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; VM, ventral midbrain.\nWhile MSC‐derived EVs offer broad immunomodulatory and regenerative benefits, NSC‐derived EVs stand out for their specialized roles in neurodevelopment and circuit repair, making them particularly promising for neurodegenerative diseases. These EVs possess intrinsic neurogenic potential, are enriched with neurotrophic factors, and have been shown to enhance synaptic plasticity and cognitive function (Volpe et al.\nNSC‐derived EVs offer different therapeutic benefits of NSCs without the complexities of cell transplantation, avoiding issues like cell survival, engraftment, and differentiation. EVs derived from NSCs do not carry the same risks of uncontrolled cell proliferation, tumor formation, or improper integration associated with live cell transplants (Li et al.\nNSC‐derived EVs can protect neurons through enhancing the expression of antioxidant enzymes and reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which rescue mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases (Li et al.\nCollectively, these properties highlight NSC‐derived EVs as a promising cell‐free therapeutic approach, offering neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and regeneration while also having the potential to be used as off‐the‐shelf products, thereby circumventing the challenges associated with direct NSC transplantation.\nAccumulating evidence from preclinical animal studies suggests that NSC‐derived EVs have significant and translatable therapeutic potential, which, with further mechanistic insights, could reshape the current treatment paradigm for neurological conditions, particularly age‐associated CNS disorders. These studies have demonstrated substantial global phenotypic improvement, including immunological, physiological, and behavioral outcomes, in the animal groups treated with NSC‐derived EVs.\nMoreover, preclinical findings suggest that NSC‐derived EVs mitigate key hallmarks of diseases, notably reducing neuroinflammation, lesion volume, neuronal loss, demyelination, and protein aggregation while enhancing neuroprotection, metabolic function, and synaptic activity (Madhu et al.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of action of NSC‐derived EVs can help identify specific molecular targets, enabling their engineering and further enhancing their therapeutic efficacy and potential as biotherapeutic agents. Mechanistic studies show that NSC‐derived EVs offer multiple therapeutic advantages, including modulating neuroinflammation, promoting neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, restoring cellular metabolism, and protecting against neurodegeneration.\nThe potential capacity of NSC‐derived EVs to promote neurogenesis and gliogenesis has fundamental roles for the replacement of cell loss associated with neurodegenerative diseases and also to switch aging‐associated quiescent NSCs to an active status and stimulate the formation of new neurons and glial cells (Ruetz et al.\nIn a study using EVs derived from NSCs, the authors have shown that EVs have the potential to buffer the effect induced by H\nNSC‐derived EVs can also regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation after spinal cord injury via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Upregulating acid‐sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1A) in NSCs raises the activity of prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which causes EVs with high PGE2 levels to be released. These EVs act in a paracrine way and inhibit NSC differentiation into oligodendrocytes. Blocking ASIC1A or PTGS2 reduces PGE2 in EVs, reversing this inhibition and promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation (Wu et al.\nMultimodal mechanisms of action of NSC‐EVs. (a) NSC‐EVs enhance neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation through miRNA‐mediated regulation, ERK signaling, and protection against oxidative stress. They also influence oligodendrocyte differentiation via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling. (b) NSC‐EVs regulate inflammatory responses via various molecular pathways. They transfer IFN‐γ to activate Stat1 signaling in target cells and suppress microglial activation through miRNA‐mediated mechanisms. NSC‐EVs also mitigate inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) via YBX1 and autophagy‐mediated pathways, reducing pro‐inflammatory cytokine expression. (c) NSC‐EVs protect against oxidative stress, preserve mitochondrial function by transferring intact mitochondria, regulate metabolic homeostasis, and counteract neurotoxic astrocyte activation. Additionally, NSC‐EVs suppress microglial reactivity, modulate inflammatory pathways, and mitigate aging‐associated neurodegenerative processes. Together, these multimodal actions highlight the therapeutic potential of NSC‐derived EVs in CNS repair and regeneration. Created by BioRender.\nCurrent studies have demonstrated that NSC‐derived EVs are an important modulator of neuroinflammation, acting through diverse mechanisms in target cells. For example, EVs from NSCs transfer IFN‐γ via Ifngr1 to activate Stat1 signaling and induce specific activation of pro‐inflammatory cytokine signaling in fibroblast cell lines (Cossetti et al.\nIn microglia, EVs from NSCs seemed to exert an anti‐inflammatory role via miRNAs. Accordingly, knockdown of NSC‐derived EV‐enriched miRNAs (including let‐7i, miR‐21a, and miR‐10b) significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of EVs on Aβ‐induced microglial activation in animal models of AD (Gao et al.\nEVs from NSCs can also promote anti‐inflammatory function, regulating the mechanisms of cellular death (Peng et al.\nMoreover, EV treatment increased the expression of the autophagy marker proteins LC3B and beclin‐1 and promoted autophagosome formation in spinal neurons after SCI. This comes together with upregulated expression of the anti‐apoptotic protein Bcl‐2 and reduced expression levels of the pro‐apoptotic protein Bax, the apoptosis effector cleaved caspase‐3 (Rong et al.\nAdditionally, Rong et al. reported that NSC‐derived EV pretreatment inhibits microglial activation (lower number of CD68+ microglia near the injury site) and reduces neuroinflammation, exhibiting lower RNA and protein expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IL‐6). In the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3‐Methyladenine (3MA), all these protective effects of EVs on spinal neurons and microglia were reversed (Rong et al.\nMoreover, hiPSC‐NSC‐EVs have shown promise in mitigating Aβ‐24o‐induced neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo in an AD mouse model by reducing neuroinflammation, amyloid plaques, and tau phosphorylation, leading to improved cognitive and mood functions (Rao et al.\nAll in all, NSC‐derived EVs can modulate neuroinflammation and promote neuronal survival by regulating miRNAs, cell death pathways (such as pyroptosis and apoptosis), and autophagy in models of neurodegenerative diseases and injury (Figure\nOne approach for ameliorating and delaying the progression of aging and the age‐associated neurodegenerative diseases is to promote neuroprotection, that is, an effect that may result in the salvage, recovery, or regeneration of the nervous system, its cells, structure, and function (Vajda\nMost preclinical studies highlight the neuroprotective role of NSC‐derived EVs, with mechanistic studies illustrating how these EVs can mitigate the effects of aging and the hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. As discussed in the previous section, research by Ma et al. and Ocana et al. has already shown the neuroprotective potential of iNSC‐ and NSC‐derived EVs, particularly in oxidative stress conditions that promote cell apoptosis (Ma, Li, et al.\nAnother key aspect of neuroprotection is the regulation of critical nutrient concentrations and the modification of the microenvironment's physiology, which helps support neuronal health and function (Iraci et al.\nFurther to improve microenvironment nutrients, cellular metabolism, and stress tolerance, EVs from NSCs could safeguard cells from neurotoxic substances, such as long‐chain saturated fatty acids secreted by reactive astrocytes (Li, Zhang, et al.\nAnother way NSC‐derived EVs promote neuroprotection is by mitigating hallmarks of the aging process, since many of these neurodegenerative conditions exhibit aging‐associated pathological pathways or are exacerbated by the aging process (Nicaise et al.\nIn an experimental model of brain insulin resistance (BIR)‐dependent cognitive impairment induced by insulin‐resistant NSCs, mice fed a high‐fat diet (HFD) showed reduced NSC proliferation and increased senescence of self‐renewing cells, as assessed by double‐labelling with BrdU and the immature neuron marker DCX (Natale et al.\nCollectively, these studies summarized in Table\nSummary of recent advances in NSC‐derived EV‐based therapies in neurological conditions.\n↑ Dopaminergic neuron survival,\n↓ ROS accumulation, apoptosis, and necrosis; catalase delivery confirmed\nNo significant effect under normal neurogenesis conditions.\nAfter Ara‐C–mediated NPC proliferation inhibition, NPC‐EVs improved neurological scores and reduced infarct volume\nIn vivo: Mouse model of status epilepticus\nIn vitro: macrophage inflammatory model\nIV and\nin vitro OGD/R\n↓ IFNβ, ↓ ELOVL1, ↓ saturated lipids; ↓ astrocyte neurotoxicity; ↓ neuronal apoptosis; motor recovery; ↓ lipid‐induced lipoapoptosis; BBB permeable.\nAlso compared NSC‐EVs with MSC‐EVs in vitro and in vivo; NSC‐EVs demonstrated superior anti‐neurotoxic astrocyte activity\n\nAbbreviations: 3MA, 3‐methyladenine; 5xFAD, transgenic mouse model carrying five familial Alzheimer's disease mutations; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ANT1/2, adenine nucleotide translocase 1 and 2; Ara‐C, cytosine arabinoside; ASIC1A, acid‐sensing ion channel subunit 1A; Aβ, amyloid‐beta peptide; BBB, blood–brain barrier; Beclin‐1, autophagy‐related protein; Catalase, antioxidant enzyme; CNS, central nervous system; COX‐2, cyclooxygenase‐2; E13, embryonic day 13; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ELOVL1, elongation of very long‐chain fatty acids protein 1; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase; EVs, extracellular vesicles; FGF2, fibroblast growth factor 2; FoxO, forkhead box O; GFs, growth factors; GPR30, G‐protein–coupled estrogen receptor 30; hfNSCs, human fetal neural stem cells; hiPSC‐NSCs, human‐induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neural stem cells; HT22, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line; I/R, ischemia–reperfusion; IC, intracerebral; ICV, intracerebroventricular; IFN‐1/IFNβ, interferon type I/beta; IGF2, insulin‐like growth factor 2; IL‐1β, interleukin‐1 beta; IN, intranasal; IRS‐1, insulin receptor substrate 1; KO, knockout; LC3B, microtubule‐associated protein 1A/1B‐light chain 3B (autophagy marker); LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MDA, malondialdehyde; mENPCs, mouse embryonic neural progenitor cells; miNSCs, induced neural stem cells; miR, microRNA; mNPCs, mouse neural progenitor cells; mNSCs, mouse neural stem cells; mSVZ, mouse subventricular zone; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; NLRP3, nucleotide‐binding oligomerization domain‐like receptor protein 3; NPCs, neural progenitor cells; NSPCs, neural stem/progenitor cells; OGD/R, oxygen–glucose deprivation/reperfusion; PD, Parkinson's disease; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; Prdx2, peroxiredoxin‐2; PTGS2, prostaglandin‐endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX‐2); rfNSCs, rat fetal neural stem cells; rNSCs, rat neural stem cells; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SCI, spinal cord injury; SH‐SY5Y, human neuroblastoma cell line; SPOP, speckle‐type POZ protein; SVZ, subventricular zone; Tau, microtubule‐associated protein tau; tMCAO, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; TNF‐α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; Txn, thioredoxin; WT, wild‐type; YBX1, Y‐box binding protein 1.\nEncouraged by robust preclinical results, the field is now progressing toward early‐phase clinical trials using NSC‐EVs. However, the transition from bench to bedside remains far from straightforward. Despite their therapeutic promise, NSC‐EVs face substantial technological and regulatory hurdles that limit their clinical translation from bench to market. A key challenge is the large‐scale, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)‐compliant production of NSC‐EVs, constrained by the limited availability of high‐quality NSC sources and the absence of standardized protocols for EV isolation, purification, and characterization. Common methods such as ultracentrifugation and tangential flow filtration often fail to ensure high yield and batch‐to‐batch consistency—both essential for clinical‐grade manufacturing (Sanz‐Ros et al.\nTo overcome these bottlenecks, advances in engineering and biomanufacturing are gaining traction. Techniques such as electroporation, transfection, and membrane fusion are being employed to enhance EV cargo loading, while surface modification with targeting peptides or antibodies improves delivery specificity. These engineering strategies, combined with scalable GMP‐compliant production systems, offer promising solutions to current limitations in yield and targeting (Ma et al.\nA search was performed on\nOngoing clinical trials of iNSC‐derived EVs in neurological disorders.\nThe Safety and Efficacy of NouvSoma001 in Ischemic Stroke\n(\nThe Safety and Efficacy of NouvSoma001 in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders\n(\n\nAbbreviations: EVs, extracellular vesicles; IV, intravenous; NCT, National Clinical Trial (identifier); NMOSD, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder; NouvSoma001, human‐induced NSC‐derived extracellular vesicles; NSC, neural stem cell; Phase I, first‐in‐human clinical trial phase focusing on safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy.\nThe translation of the NSC‐derived EV biotherapeutic approach into clinical practice remains constrained by a range of scientific, technical, and regulatory challenges. Among these are issues related to the standardization of EV production and characterization, heterogeneity, scalability for clinical‐grade manufacturing, delivery across the BBB, and long‐term safety. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of EVs is closely tied to the biological profile of their parental NSCs, making the choice of cell source a critical determinant of success.\nEV characteristics are largely determined by the properties of their parent cells. Selecting an appropriate NSC source requires careful evaluation of several factors, including donor compatibility (autologous vs. allogeneic), tumorigenic factors, population purity and homogeneity, and the specific disease context (focal vs. multifocal or widespread). NSCs can be derived from various regions of the brain or spinal cord, from fetal or adult tissues, or through direct reprogramming of ES or iPS cells—each yielding EVs with distinct molecular signatures and functional capacities. Therefore, NSC source selection must be tailored to the specific neurological condition being targeted.\nHistorically, human NSCs isolated from fetal tissues have been a common source of EVs due to their ability to differentiate into a range of neural lineages and their therapeutic potential (Willis, Nicaise, Peruzzotti‐Jametti, and Pluchino\nFurthermore, EVs derived from NSCs of different brain regions may also vary in their therapeutic effects. For instance, EVs from a human fetal NSC line displayed neuroprotective properties against oxidative stress in vitro, while hypothalamic NSC‐derived EVs demonstrated endocrine‐like effects, influencing neurogenesis and systemic aging in mice (Bonetto and Grilli\nNSC‐derived EVs, even when produced from a similar cell source, represent a highly heterogeneous population with diverse molecular cargo, physical properties, and biological functions—posing significant challenges for their clinical standardization (Peruzzotti‐Jametti et al.\nTo address these limitations, several promising approaches have emerged. First, subpopulation isolation techniques such as microfluidics, size‐exclusion chromatography, and immunoaffinity capture using markers like CD63 or NCAM can help obtain functionally uniform EV subsets for therapeutic use (Zhang, Huang, et al.\nCollectively, these strategies provide a rational roadmap to overcome NSC‐EV heterogeneity and facilitate their safe, consistent, and effective application in CNS therapeutics.\nBeyond the need for production and characterization standardization, optimization of storage and downstream handling is also critical for the clinical translation of NSC‐derived EVs. In relation to optimization of storage conditions, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) recommends that EVs be conserved in isotonic buffers to prevent pH shifts during storage as well as during freezing and thawing procedures and stored at −80°C (Welsh et al.\nTreating CNS diseases with EVs is particularly challenging due to the presence of the BBB; therefore, various delivery methods are currently under investigation. The most effective approach for delivering NSC‐derived EVs across different neurological conditions needs to be optimized in a disease‐specific manner. Common delivery strategies include (a) intranasal administration, which allows rapid CNS absorption; (b) intravascular microbubbles combined with focused ultrasound to transiently open the BBB; (c) oral delivery of plant‐, milk‐, or bacteria‐derived EVs, which have been shown to reach the brain in some studies; (d) intravenous injection, though limited by short circulation time and rapid clearance; (e) intraperitoneal injection, which allows for high local uptake; and (f) subcutaneous injection, which shows minimal brain delivery. More invasive approaches include (g–h) intrathecal or intraventricular injection into the CSF, and (i) direct injection into specific brain regions or tumors (Nieland et al.\nWith advancements in EV isolation and enhanced cell specificity, EVs hold great promise for tissue‐specific applications by enabling targeted therapy delivery, improving treatment efficacy, and minimizing side effects (Zhang, Wu, et al.\nNevertheless, ethical and regulatory challenges remain significant considerations in the development of EV‐based therapies. The ISEV emphasizes that EV therapies are subject to regulations governing “tissues and cells” and “advanced therapy medicinal products” (ATMPs) (Lener et al.\nAltogether, despite the significant promise of NSC‐derived EVs for neurological therapy, several challenges must be addressed before their widespread clinical application. Key challenges include optimizing NSC sources, standardizing EV isolation and characterization, scaling up production while ensuring quality, and evaluating long‐term safety. Refining delivery strategies and advancing EV bioengineering, storage, and regulatory frameworks are essential for translating NSC‐EVs into clinically viable off‐the‐shelf therapies.\nThe CNS has limited regenerative capacity, with NSCs residing in neurogenic zones playing a role in self‐repair. While they hold promise for treating neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, their endogenous repair capacity is often insufficient, particularly with aging, which compromises neurogenesis and contributes to disease progression. Dysfunction within the NSC niche, influenced by inflammation and environmental factors, further limits their regenerative potential. Approaches such as neurotrophic factors, gene therapy, and in vivo glial reprogramming show promise but face clinical challenges.\nNSCs can be sourced from embryonic, fetal, or adult tissues, or reprogrammed from somatic cells. Despite promising preclinical and early clinical data in MS, ALS, and PD, challenges such as ethical concerns, tumorigenicity, and donor compatibility remain. NSC‐derived EVs, serving as a potent mechanism of action in NSC therapy, represent a promising cell‐free biotherapeutic approach due to their intrinsic neurogenic potential, offering advantages over cell therapy such as reduced immunogenicity and enhanced targeting capabilities. They provide neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and metabolic support, promoting neural regeneration in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases.\nPreclinical studies show that NSC‐EVs can mitigate neurodegeneration, reduce oxidative stress, and support mitochondrial function—modulating multiple pathways critical to CNS repair. Ongoing clinical trials underscore their potential as scalable, off‐the‐shelf therapeutics for stroke and neuroimmune disorders. However, translating NSC‐EVs into clinical therapies will require significant progress in optimizing delivery strategies, refining bioengineering approaches, and establishing comprehensive safety profiles. Key challenges include minimizing EV heterogeneity and off‐target effects, ensuring the long‐term safety of repeated administration, and eliminating unintended cargo such as oncogenic miRNAs or pro‐inflammatory cytokines. Clinical success will depend on a coordinated, multidisciplinary effort—integrating advanced bioengineering, standardized analytical methods, rigorous safety testing, and harmonized global regulatory frameworks. Central to this progress will be the development of GMP‐compliant manufacturing processes, validated potency assays, and clear regulatory pathways tailored to the unique complexity of NSC‐EV‐based therapeutics. Ultimately, bridging the fields of neural stem cell biology, nanotechnology, and clinical neuroscience will be crucial to unlock the full therapeutic potential of NSC‐EVs and bring transformative treatments to patients with currently untreatable neurological diseases.\n\nDuring the preparation of this work the authors used ChatGPT to check the grammar.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gradually become a novel therapeutic option, with burgeoning preclinical evidence elucidating their multimodal therapeutic potential in peripheral nerve reconstruction. This research has produced promising outcomes, contributing to both fundamental research and translational medicine. However, a comprehensive synthesis of the roles of MSCs and their derivatives in nerve regeneration is still lacking.

Furthermore, MSCs have the potential to differentiate into myelin-forming cell lineages and Schwann-like cells, thereby contributing to nerve repair [\nStem cells can be categorized into totipotent, pluripotent, and monopotent types based on their differentiation potential, with MSCs falling under the classification of pluripotent stem cells. MSCs are a unique type of stem cell known for their capacity to self-renew, quickly multiply, and transform into various cell types. Because they can modulate the immune system, reduce inflammation, prevent apoptosis, and promote angiogenesis, they are well-suited for regenerative medicine [\nBone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs), umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), dental mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are among the most extensively researched and applied stem cell types. These cells, along with their derivatives—such as exosomes, mitochondria, secretomes, organoids, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and microRNAs—are illustrated in\nSeveral common MSC types (mainly BMSCs, ADSCs, UCMSCs, DMSCs, and iPSCs) and their derivatives (mainly exosomes, mitochondria, the secretome, organoids, ECM, and microRNAs) used to promote peripheral nerve regeneration.\nDerived from animal bone marrow, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are among the most thoroughly studied cell types in relation to peripheral nerve injury [\nIsolated from the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue, ADSCs are considered an excellent source of MSCs due to their high availability, easy accessibility, and powerful immunomodulatory functions. Notably, their therapeutic potential remains unaffected by the donor age or anatomical harvesting site while maintaining stable phenotypic characteristics and long-term plasticity\nDerived from the umbilical cords of newborns, UCMSCs provide a safe and easily obtainable source of stem cells with notable therapeutic benefits. Compared with MSCs derived from adult tissues, UCMSCs exhibit a superior proliferative capacity, enhanced differentiation potential, and more potent immunomodulatory properties [\nThrough various mechanisms such as paracrine effects, vascular and synaptic regeneration, immune system modulation, and apoptosis inhibition, DMSCs may be crucial in treating neurological conditions. The isolation of dental stem cells from the pulp of permanent teeth was first achieved by Gronthos in 2002, who named them dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), indicating that dental tissues could potentially be a source of stem cells. The taxonomic delineation of odontogenic stem cells is fundamentally contingent upon their distinctive anatomical derivation. The following subpopulations have been identified: DPSCs, periodontal stem cells (PDLSCs), deciduous stem cells (SHEDs), and gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs). Furthermore, they are capable of differentiating into various cell lineages, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, myoblasts, and neuronal cells, among others. DPSCs, PDLSCs, and SHEDs all originate in the neural crest, which is a significant distinction from the source of BMSCs, which originate from the mesoderm [\nCompared with the majority of MSCs, DMSCs derived from the neural crest display enhanced proliferative and neural differentiation capabilities, exhibit remarkable anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and can be harvested in a manner that circumvents invasive surgical procedures while facilitating expeditious gingival tissue healing without scarring. Despite their disparate origins, they all exhibit analogous properties, including self-renewal, multidirectional differentiation, immunomodulation, and the expression of MSC surface markers [\nEmerging experimental evidence reveals that GMSC-differentiated Schwann-like cells possess dual-functional characteristics encompassing neurotrophic support and macrophage polarization regulation. Mechanistically, these biological attributes demonstrate marked therapeutic efficacy in potentiating axonal regrowth and functional neural restoration in rodent sciatic nerve injury models [\niPSCs, formally defined as reprogrammed pluripotent stem cells, constitute a specialized class of pluripotent cells generated through defined transcriptional factor-mediated epigenetic reprogramming of terminally differentiated somatic cells, ultimately possessing molecular and functional equivalency to embryonic stem cells. This genetically engineered cell lineage demonstrates embryonic stem cell-equivalent totipotency through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic modification, exhibiting congruent molecular signatures in cellular morphology, transcriptional profiles, proteomic expression patterns, and multilineage differentiation capacity that meet stringent equivalence criteria to their embryonic counterparts, thereby achieving functional equivalency in regenerative therapeutic applications. Its potential applications are nearly identical to those of embryonic stem cells. iPSCs offer multiple advantages. Primarily, they can be derived from a wide range of sources and can be artificially synthesized without ethical constraints. Second, iPSCs exhibit a robust regenerative differentiation capacity, which provides a novel avenue for advancement in the broader field of stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine research [\nOncomodulin (OCM) is a myeloid-derived growth factor that has been reported to promote axon regeneration following optic nerve injury or peripheral nerve injury. Xie\nThe choice of cell type as well as the mode and quantity of cell transplant delivery will affect the final therapeutic effect. In-depth studies of the mechanisms of action, modulation of signaling pathways, and cell–cell interactions are needed. The challenges include resolving the quality control issues of transplanted cells, immune rejection, and ethical issues. In clinical translation, a greater need is to identify accurate molecular mechanisms and assess their efficacy. The mechanisms of action, signaling pathways, and advantages and disadvantages of different MSCs for the treatment of nerve injury are summarized in\nThe therapeutic utilization of common stem cell types for peripheral nerve regeneration requires systematic analysis through cellular origin, signaling axis, therapeutic merits/limitations, and molecular effector pathways\nGuo\nCombinatorial cellular therapy with autologous MSCs and Schwann cells demonstrated significant neurological recovery in 106 complete SCI patients during therapeutic intervention and follow-up monitoring. Targeted intrathecal delivery of BMSC-SC combinations enhanced urodynamic metrics while reducing urinary incontinence incidence and elevating quality of life (QoL) parameters in neurogenic bladder cases [\nThe clinical trial demonstrated favorable safety profiles for both MSC variants. Subjects exhibited statistically significant enhancements in sensorimotor domains. Furthermore, anal sphincter control improvements with enhanced deep pressure perception were documented across cohorts, correlating with enhanced QoL metrics. Significantly, two Group B participants achieved complete bladder autonomy, eliminating catheterization dependence [\nContemporary research establishes MSCs as mediating therapeutic outcomes through exosomal secretion. These nanoscale extracellular vesicles (30–150 nm diameter) feature a lipid bilayer envelope. Their biogenesis initiates with plasma membrane invagination forming early endosomes, progressing through endosomal sorting complex required for transport-mediated maturation where intraluminal vesicle budding occurs. Subsequent membrane fusion enables exocytic secretion of these vesicles. Crucially, exosomes transport diverse cargo including regulatory RNAs, functional proteins, lipid signaling molecules, and bioactive metabolites [\nExosomes derived from stem cells present several advantages over MSCs, including their smaller size, good biocompatibility, low toxicity, stability, and ability to act as molecular carriers. These vesicles mediate intercellular signaling and modulate tissue-level homeostatic regulation [\nStem cell-derived extracellular vesicles can directly act on neurons and axons at the injury site to promote peripheral nerve regeneration. Moreover, they can promote peripheral nerve regeneration by stimulating Schwann cells to dedifferentiate into repair-type Schwann cells, inducing angiogenesis, stimulating proinflammatory macrophages to transform into anti-inflammatory macrophages, alleviating NP, and ultimately restoring neural reinnervation of the target organ. The figure was drawn by the author\nThe most intuitive method for restoring nerve integrity is axonal growth, which represents the primary objective of numerous therapeutic strategies for nerve injury. Emerging research establishes MSC-derived exosomes as innovative nanovesicle-based gene delivery systems that activate nerve regeneration-related pathways and promote nerve regeneration through the delivery of microRNAs (miRs) to target cells, thereby regulating gene expression [\nPost-exosomal internalization, Schwann cells acquire augmented functional competence. Hu\nThe development of the nervous system is supported by the formation of blood vessels. In addition to supplying oxygen and nutrients to peripheral neurons, which require an energy source, blood vessels also function as active signaling systems [\nA number of recent studies have revealed that exosomes can act as regulatory substances to promote vascular regeneration. Gong\nMSCs possess robust immunomodulatory capabilities, and their secreted exosomes have been shown to exert similar effects. Following the onset of peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells phagocytose and remove myelin debris, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and recruit immune cells when Wallerian degeneration occurs. First, the earliest cells recruited to the site of injury are granulocytes and neutrophils, which can prevent secondary infections from bacteria and other microorganisms. Eosinophils may also participate in tissue repair processes, as they can release various mediators that contribute to tissue remodeling [\nNP arises from neural lesions or aberrant neural signaling, manifesting as chronic pain. Peripheral nerve trauma (PNI) inducing sensory fiber lesions triggers NP, substantially compromising patient quality of life metrics. At present, no specific pharmacological agent is capable of completely treating NP. Some studies have indicated the potential existence of an association between NP and low-grade inflammation [\nMitochondria serve as the principal intracellular organelles for cellular energy production. Their structural architecture features a double-membrane system organized into four distinct compartments: outer membrane, inner membrane, intermembrane space, and mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane is populated with a multitude of respiratory chain complexes, which are instrumental in the oxidative phosphorylation process and facilitate the conversion of nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), thereby supplying the cell with energy [\nIntercellular mitochondrial transfer from MSCs modulates key cellular functions in recipient cells, encompassing proliferation, migration, differentiation, metabolic reprogramming, and phenotypic plasticity. The main pathways for the mitochondrial transfer of MSCs include tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) (Cx43, GAP43, and Rho-GTPase Miro1-dependent pathways), extracellular vesicles (Rab7-GDP-dependent pathway), gap junctions, and cell fusion. Furthermore, cells are also capable of ingesting free mitochondria that have been released by MSCs [\nStem cell-derived mitochondria mediate neural regeneration via molecular mechanisms including mitochondrial transfer, transplantation, and immunomodulatory pathways. Mitochondrial transfer primarily operates through intercellular proximity, utilizing dual transfer modalities: TNTs (Cx43/GAP43/Rho-GTPase Miro1-regulated) and Rab7-GDP-mediated vesicular transport. Mitochondrial transfer enhances peripheral nerve repair via bioenergetic support, ferroptosis suppression, neovascularization induction, and homeostatic microenvironment modulation. Mitochondrial transplantation involves extracting exosomes from stem cells through artificial techniques. After identification and concentration, they can be used to target muscles or directly for nerves at the injury site. In terms of immune regulation, mitochondria can enter recipient cells through PRRs; mitochondria can also activate the innate immune response of cells by releasing mtDNA into the cytoplasm, increasing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and causing chronic inflammation and functional decline through different signaling pathways. In addition, adipose tissue at the site of nerve injury can act on Schwann cells by secreting leptin, thereby increasing the ATP content inside the cells to support regeneration damage-associated molecular patterns. The figure was drawn by the author\nAfter nerve injury, mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in neurons. Healthy mitochondria can be transported into damaged neurons by exogenous implantation strategies to help restore the energy balance, rescue mitochondrial dysfunction, and support cell survival. Kuo\nIntercellular mitochondrial dynamics and exogenous mitochondrial engraftment within peripheral neural regenerative paradigms. (\nPNI pathogenesis induces an inflammatory microenvironment that partially compromises neural repair mechanisms. Mitochondria play pivotal roles in the inflammatory response, regulating oxidative stress and apoptosis. Additionally, they serve as a source of energy for immune cells through oxidative phosphorylation [\nIn the context of injury, damaged mitochondria can release mtDNA, proteins, and other substances into the cytosol. These molecules function as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), eliciting innate immune activation through pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling. The release of mitochondrial DNA and reactive oxygen species can stimulate an immune response within the host cell, which, in turn, causes inflammation. Mitochondria orchestrate phagocytic and apoptotic mechanisms to mitigate DAMP generation while preserving organellar homeostasis and functionality [\nMitochondrial dysfunction triggers cytoplasmic/extracellular compartmentalization of organellar components and byproducts, inducing inflammatory cascades. The cGAS-STING1 axis operates as the core regulatory hub for mitochondria-driven inflammation while concurrently serving as a central contributor to age-related chronic inflammation and physiological deterioration. Apoptotic and autophagic pathways constitute essential regulatory mechanisms in mitigating mitochondrial inflammatory pathogenesis [\nMitochondrial autophagy represents an intracellular protective mechanism for the removal of damaged or abnormally functioning mitochondria. This process maintains mitochondrial quality and function and, in tissues, prevents excessive inflammatory responses, which can be exacerbated when mitochondrial autophagy is impaired [\nWhile mitochondria are recognized as significant regulators of inflammation, additional research is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Although a substantial body of evidence linking inflammatory responses driven by mitochondrial dysfunction to disease exists, a clear mechanistic understanding is lacking [\nMesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium (MSC-CM)—comprising the MSC secretome—is enriched with bioactive molecules (e.g. cytokines and growth factors) released by MSCs. Notably, MSC-CM has emerged as a pivotal cell-free therapeutic modality in neuroregeneration, circumventing tumorigenic risks, immunological rejection, and ethical constraints inherent to MSC transplantation. Proteomic profiling of diverse MSC lineages identified secretomes abundant in neurotrophic factors—VEGF, IGF, PDGF, and HGF—and anti-inflammatory cytokines [\nIn peripheral nerve injury, the application of MSC-CM may act through neurotrophic factors to reduce cell death in neurons and satellite cells [\nThe secretome of DMSCs provides superior neuroprotection. DMSCs exhibit neurotrophic superiority over BMSCs and ADSCs through trophic factor enrichment. DMSCs orchestrate Schwann cell mitogenesis, chemotaxis, and lineage commitment via cytokines (IGF-1/BDNF), while PDGF/TGF-β signaling drives concurrent neurovascular regeneration. Collectively, DMSC-CM establishes a neuroprotective niche supporting axogenesis, myelin reformation, metabolic homeostasis, and antiapoptotic effects [\nThe secretome encompasses all cellularly secreted proteins into the extracellular milieu, comprising paracrine factors, microbubbles, and exosomes. Exosomes constitute a key constituent of this secretory repertoire. The role of exosomes is as described above, whereas the secretome, as a mixture, exerts a broader neuroregenerative effect.\nOrganoids are tissue analogs with a specific three-dimensional structure that are formed using adult stem cells or pluripotent stem cells in three-dimensional culture\nVan Lent\nThe manipulation of the ECM and gene regulation are highly important in the construction of organoids. Stem cell-derived organoids display the characteristics of the organ of origin, including cell types, functions, and tissue spatial structures. Furthermore, microfluidic systems, endothelial cell coverage modules, and vascular endothelial growth factor delivery systems have been shown to be effective in promoting the formation of blood vessels, thereby facilitating the transport of oxygen or nutrients to the interior of organoids. The study of organoids has evolved significantly over time, progressing from planar cell culture to 3D structured tissue culture and beyond. ECM research has been a key area of development, as has the creation of vascularization techniques and spatiotemporal regulation of signaling pathways [\nGuo\nNMJ formation between human fetal spinal stem cell-derived motoneurons and skeletal muscle stem cell-generated myofibers. (\nFor large segmental nerve defects, autologous nerve grafts remain the clinical gold standard. However, limitations persist with this method, prompting the development of tissue-engineered nerve grafts as emerging viable alternatives. From a bionics perspective, nerve grafts based on the ECM have unparalleled advantages over other synthetic grafts.\nThe ECM—a cell-secreted network extracellularly deposited in tissues—comprises two molecular classes: fibrous proteins (collagen, elastin) and glycoproteins (fibronectin, proteoglycans, and laminin) [\nSchematic of key ECM constituents: fibronectin, collagen, integrin, glycosaminoglycan, proteoglycans, and laminin, functioning as a tissue engineering scaffold. The figure was drawn by the author\nWith respect to tissue-derived ECM, research on decellularized porcine neurogenic ECM is more prevalent. This approach is employed to create hydrogels that are used to fill the gaps in nerves and enhance nerve regeneration. Previous research by our group has shown that the treatment of porcine peripheral nerves using supercritical extraction composite technology to maximize the removal of DNA and fat from NGs can facilitate enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation, thereby rendering it a decellularization method with considerable clinical applicability [\nCell-derived and multiple forms of tissue-derived ECM promote peripheral nerve regeneration. (\nThe ECM serves as neural conduits/graft scaffolds to modulate regenerative microenvironments during neural repair [\nAs previously stated, microRNAs (miRs) may be responsible for modulating the relevant regenerative signaling pathways in peripheral nerve regeneration therapy using MSCs. miRs are endogenous noncoding RNAs (~22 nt) mediating posttranscriptional regulation in organisms. Multiple miRs critically regulate post-injury nerve regeneration. Transcriptomics identified upregulated miR-21/132/29a/29b post-sciatic injury, modulating stress responses and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Upstream regulators (miRs, including let-7, miR-21 and miR-223) correlate with PNI-induced transcriptional dysregulation, demonstrating essential roles in peripheral nerve repair [\nThe involvement of miRs in myelin formation and synaptic plasticity has been documented. Ma\nmiRs critically regulate immune function and neuronal differentiation. Wang\nThe involvement of microRNAs (miRs) in myelin formation and nerve regeneration has been documented, and miRs can exert their regulatory functions by acting on Schwann cells. miR-21 overexpression downregulates PTEN and activates PI3K, driving Schwann cell phenotypic reprogramming to enhance axonal regeneration and post-injury functional recovery [\nNotably, the lifespan of miRs is relatively short, which may limit their continuous effects during treatment. However, through an appropriate carrier or drug delivery system, the duration of their effects can be prolonged to a certain extent, and their effectiveness in PNR can be improved [\nWhether derivatives synergistically promote nerve regeneration when used in combination is a question worth pondering. MSCs exert different effects under different conditions, and manual intervention, such as the simultaneous extraction of mitochondria and exosomes from MSCs, may be required if combination therapy is needed.\nECM and secretome collaboratively establish a pro-regenerative microenvironment. Secretome-derived growth factors/cytokines modulate ECM biosynthesis/secretion, while ECM reciprocally adsorbs/enriches the secretome’s bioactive molecules, creating localized high-concentration niches [\nMitochondria-secretome interplay sustains neuronal energy/functional support. Secretome-derived IGF-1 enhances mitochondrial internalization within neuronal populations, while mitochondria provide ATP to neuronal cells to maintain their energy requirements during regeneration [\nmiRs and exosomes cooperate to regulate gene expression in neuronal cells at the posttranscriptional level [\nMulticomponent synergy (MSC-exosomes/secretome/mitochondria/ECM/miRs derivatives) potentiates neural regeneration via establishing regenerative niches, sustaining neuronal homeostasis, and epigenetic modulation. While preclinical evidence demonstrates efficacy, clinical translation requires validation of these combinatorial mechanisms.\nStem cell transplantation emerges as a promising therapeutic strategy, with clinical trials demonstrating early-phase benefits in patient cohorts. Current studies indicate MSC derivatives (exosomes/mitochondria/ECM) elicit comparable therapeutic efficacy to parental MSCs. However, the current theories and techniques regarding cell therapy application and clinical translation have not yet fully matured, which has become an obstacle to the clinical translation of MSCs and their derivative therapies. Thus, MSC and derivative developmental trajectories center on these key aspects: (i) In-depth research must be conducted and standardized protocols optimized. Innovative extraction and purification techniques are needed. In the future, a pressing need is to develop more efficient and precise extraction and purification methods for MSCs and their derivatives. (ii) Research on cellular and molecular mechanisms is needed. Further exploration of the interactions between MSCs and their derivatives and the immune and vascular systems during neural regeneration is necessary. (iii) Exploring and implementing combined therapeutic strategies is a third approach. Synergistic therapeutic regimens for MSCs and other cells (e.g. neural stem cells and Schwann cells) or biologically active factors, along with rational combinations of MSCs with other cells with the potential to repair nerves (such as neural stem cells and Schwann cells) or biologically active factors, can achieve synergistic effects. (iv) These treatments should be integrated organically with traditional therapies. The modes of combined application of MSCs and their derivative treatments with surgical, physical, and pharmacological therapies and other traditional treatment modalities should be explored. Simultaneously, formulating clinical application guidelines is necessary to clarify issues such as cell sources, preparation processes, administration routes and dosages, and treatment timing.", "content_for_embedding": "Compared with other mesenchymal stem cells, dental mesenchymal stem cells originating from the neural crest have strong neurogenic and immunoregulatory abilities, thus showing promising application and transformation prospects in the field of PNI repair.\nExosomes play important roles in the repair process of PNI by activating Schwann cells, regulating neuroinflammation, promoting angiogenesis and axonal regeneration, and ameliorating neuropathic pain.\nDuring the PNI repair process, mitochondria transferred\nCell-derived and tissue-derived extracellular matrices (ECMs) can provide scaffolds for peripheral nerve tissue engineering, and cell-derived ECMs show great potential for clinical translation.\nPeripheral nerve injury (PNI)—induced by mechanical trauma or compressive forces—may precipitate varying degrees of sensorimotor deficits, with clinical manifestations ranging from transient neuralgia to irreversible neuromuscular impairment mediated through Wallerian degeneration pathways [\nMSCs demonstrate neuroregenerative potential through paracrine secretion of neurotrophins (e.g. brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF)) during peripheral nerve repair processes, establishing chemotactic gradients that guide axonal sprouting and elongation.

Collectively, DMSC-CM establishes a neuroprotective niche supporting axogenesis, myelin reformation, metabolic homeostasis, and antiapoptotic effects [\nThe secretome encompasses all cellularly secreted proteins into the extracellular milieu, comprising paracrine factors, microbubbles, and exosomes. Exosomes constitute a key constituent of this secretory repertoire. The role of exosomes is as described above, whereas the secretome, as a mixture, exerts a broader neuroregenerative effect.\nOrganoids are tissue analogs with a specific three-dimensional structure that are formed using adult stem cells or pluripotent stem cells in three-dimensional culture\nVan Lent\nThe manipulation of the ECM and gene regulation are highly important in the construction of organoids. Stem cell-derived organoids display the characteristics of the organ of origin, including cell types, functions, and tissue spatial structures. Furthermore, microfluidic systems, endothelial cell coverage modules, and vascular endothelial growth factor delivery systems have been shown to be effective in promoting the formation of blood vessels, thereby facilitating the transport of oxygen or nutrients to the interior of organoids. The study of organoids has evolved significantly over time, progressing from planar cell culture to 3D structured tissue culture and beyond. ECM research has been a key area of development, as has the creation of vascularization techniques and spatiotemporal regulation of signaling pathways [\nGuo\nNMJ formation between human fetal spinal stem cell-derived motoneurons and skeletal muscle stem cell-generated myofibers. (\nFor large segmental nerve defects, autologous nerve grafts remain the clinical gold standard. However, limitations persist with this method, prompting the development of tissue-engineered nerve grafts as emerging viable alternatives. From a bionics perspective, nerve grafts based on the ECM have unparalleled advantages over other synthetic grafts.\nThe ECM—a cell-secreted network extracellularly deposited in tissues—comprises two molecular classes: fibrous proteins (collagen, elastin) and glycoproteins (fibronectin, proteoglycans, and laminin) [\nSchematic of key ECM constituents: fibronectin, collagen, integrin, glycosaminoglycan, proteoglycans, and laminin, functioning as a tissue engineering scaffold. The figure was drawn by the author\nWith respect to tissue-derived ECM, research on decellularized porcine neurogenic ECM is more prevalent. This approach is employed to create hydrogels that are used to fill the gaps in nerves and enhance nerve regeneration. Previous research by our group has shown that the treatment of porcine peripheral nerves using supercritical extraction composite technology to maximize the removal of DNA and fat from NGs can facilitate enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation, thereby rendering it a decellularization method with considerable clinical applicability [\nCell-derived and multiple forms of tissue-derived ECM promote peripheral nerve regeneration. (\nThe ECM serves as neural conduits/graft scaffolds to modulate regenerative microenvironments during neural repair [\nAs previously stated, microRNAs (miRs) may be responsible for modulating the relevant regenerative signaling pathways in peripheral nerve regeneration therapy using MSCs. miRs are endogenous noncoding RNAs (~22 nt) mediating posttranscriptional regulation in organisms. Multiple miRs critically regulate post-injury nerve regeneration. Transcriptomics identified upregulated miR-21/132/29a/29b post-sciatic injury, modulating stress responses and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Upstream regulators (miRs, including let-7, miR-21 and miR-223) correlate with PNI-induced transcriptional dysregulation, demonstrating essential roles in peripheral nerve repair [\nThe involvement of miRs in myelin formation and synaptic plasticity has been documented. Ma\nmiRs critically regulate immune function and neuronal differentiation. Wang\nThe involvement of microRNAs (miRs) in myelin formation and nerve regeneration has been documented, and miRs can exert their regulatory functions by acting on Schwann cells. miR-21 overexpression downregulates PTEN and activates PI3K, driving Schwann cell phenotypic reprogramming to enhance axonal regeneration and post-injury functional recovery [\nNotably, the lifespan of miRs is relatively short, which may limit their continuous effects during treatment. However, through an appropriate carrier or drug delivery system, the duration of their effects can be prolonged to a certain extent, and their effectiveness in PNR can be improved [\nWhether derivatives synergistically promote nerve regeneration when used in combination is a question worth pondering. MSCs exert different effects under different conditions, and manual intervention, such as the simultaneous extraction of mitochondria and exosomes from MSCs, may be required if combination therapy is needed.\nECM and secretome collaboratively establish a pro-regenerative microenvironment. Secretome-derived growth factors/cytokines modulate ECM biosynthesis/secretion, while ECM reciprocally adsorbs/enriches the secretome’s bioactive molecules, creating localized high-concentration niches [\nMitochondria-secretome interplay sustains neuronal energy/functional support. Secretome-derived IGF-1 enhances mitochondrial internalization within neuronal populations, while mitochondria provide ATP to neuronal cells to maintain their energy requirements during regeneration [\nmiRs and exosomes cooperate to regulate gene expression in neuronal cells at the posttranscriptional level [\nMulticomponent synergy (MSC-exosomes/secretome/mitochondria/ECM/miRs derivatives) potentiates neural regeneration via establishing regenerative niches, sustaining neuronal homeostasis, and epigenetic modulation. While preclinical evidence demonstrates efficacy, clinical translation requires validation of these combinatorial mechanisms.\nStem cell transplantation emerges as a promising therapeutic strategy, with clinical trials demonstrating early-phase benefits in patient cohorts. Current studies indicate MSC derivatives (exosomes/mitochondria/ECM) elicit comparable therapeutic efficacy to parental MSCs. However, the current theories and techniques regarding cell therapy application and clinical translation have not yet fully matured, which has become an obstacle to the clinical translation of MSCs and their derivative therapies. Thus, MSC and derivative developmental trajectories center on these key aspects: (i) In-depth research must be conducted and standardized protocols optimized. Innovative extraction and purification techniques are needed. In the future, a pressing need is to develop more efficient and precise extraction and purification methods for MSCs and their derivatives. (ii) Research on cellular and molecular mechanisms is needed. Further exploration of the interactions between MSCs and their derivatives and the immune and vascular systems during neural regeneration is necessary. (iii) Exploring and implementing combined therapeutic strategies is a third approach. Synergistic therapeutic regimens for MSCs and other cells (e.g. neural stem cells and Schwann cells) or biologically active factors, along with rational combinations of MSCs with other cells with the potential to repair nerves (such as neural stem cells and Schwann cells) or biologically active factors, can achieve synergistic effects. (iv) These treatments should be integrated organically with traditional therapies. The modes of combined application of MSCs and their derivative treatments with surgical, physical, and pharmacological therapies and other traditional treatment modalities should be explored. Simultaneously, formulating clinical application guidelines is necessary to clarify issues such as cell sources, preparation processes, administration routes and dosages, and treatment timing.", "topic": "Neuroinflammation"}

We utilized a rat model of synucleinopathy induced by intrastriatal injection of OSyn, aiming to elucidate events preceding the formation of fibrillary α-syn aggregates. Electrophysiological assessments and behavioral assays revealed several early alterations in OSyn rats, evident as early as 12 weeks post-OSyn injection. These included mild and variable reduction of motor activity, anxiety-like behavior, impaired bidirectional striatal long-term synaptic plasticity, and diminished spontaneous excitatory neurotransmission in the striatum. Furthermore, p-α-syn aggregates were detected in the cortex but not in the substantia nigra (SN). Confocal microscopy analysis revealed reduced vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) expression at striatal glutamatergic terminals. Chronic administration of the ampakine Tulrampator to OSyn animals prevented impairment of long-term depression (LTD), spontaneous striatal neurotransmission, and VGluT1 levels. Tulrampator also ameliorated the anxiety-related behavioral phenotype, albeit without attenuating motor deficits, demonstrating its efficacy in mitigating early synaptic and emotional deficits induced by OSyn.

Pathological α-syn can exist in diverse conformations within the CNS, spanning from unfolded monomers to resilient fibrils. Recent investigations have elucidated the impacts of these protein aggregates at the synaptic level, demonstrating that α-syn protofibrils can initiate early synaptic dysfunction within the basal ganglia circuitry, resembling the initial phases of PD\nBehavioral assessments conducted 12 weeks post-OSyn injections revealed a significant deficit in locomotor activity and increased anxiety-like behavior. Notably, these rats displayed a discernible preference for proximity to the arena walls in the open field, coupled with heightened immobility and diminished exploration, indicative of an anxiety-like state. These findings corroborate previous investigations in preclinical animal models linking α-syn aggregates to neurobehavioral alterations\nClinical observations further validate these results, since a higher prevalence of affective symptoms is observed in PD patients compared to the general population\nThe observed behavioral changes may reflect disruptions in activity-dependent plastic mechanisms that can be disrupted in the presence of toxic α-syn species\nAccordingly, electrophysiological recordings revealed that, while the membrane properties of striatal SPNs remained unaffected in OSyn rats, both forms of long-term synaptic plasticity were abolished. This suggests that α-syn aggregates adversely affect the functional connectivity of SPNs, disrupting cortico-striatal input integration and motor coordination output, consistent with previous findings\nThese findings align with recent studies indicating that the spread of α-syn may be influenced by both anatomical connectivity and variable α-syn expression across brain regions\nThe examination of spontaneous excitatory currents in striatal SPNs also unveiled synaptic alterations in neurotransmission. A notable decrease in the sEPSCs frequency, but not the amplitude, was observed, suggesting a presynaptic dysfunction, thus implying an unaffected number of postsynaptic receptors at excitatory synapses.

The selective vulnerability of cortical inputs and their restoration by Tulrampator suggest that enhancing cortical-striatal connectivity may be a promising therapeutic strategy. This approach could complement more conventional therapies aimed at restoring dopamine levels during the early stages of alpha-synucleinopathies. By addressing both motor and non-motor symptoms, such interventions may slow down the progression of synucleinopathy-related impairments, particularly in the prodromal phase of PD, thus greatly improving patients’ quality of life.\nThis study was designed to investigate the early stages of α-synuclein aggregation and to evaluate the in vivo relevance of OSyn in the onset of motor and non-motor symptoms. While the model successfully captures some early synaptic dysfunctions, it does not replicate the advanced stages of PD, as indicated by the preserved integrity of SN dopaminergic neurons and the absence of significant reductions in DAT or TH levels. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed through the open-field test, which, although a reliable first-line tool, would benefit from complementary behavioral paradigms in future studies to strengthen these findings. Moreover, the variability in mobility observed in this task may reflect early, subtle changes rather than a clear motor deficit. While a DMSO-only control group was not included in Tulrampator experiments, previous studies have demonstrated the non-toxicity of the dose used, supporting the interpretation of Tulrampator-specific effects.\nThe detection of p-α-syn in the cortex supports a pattern of local accumulation following OSyn injection; however, we recognize that the extent of α-synuclein aggregation observed may exceed what is typically reported in prodromal PD brains. A potential confounding effect related to the injection route of OSyn cannot be fully excluded. Our data support the idea that p-α-syn accumulation alone can affect cortico-striatal function. However, we acknowledge that a causal link between this dysfunction and prodromal anxiety-like symptoms in PD remains to be clearly established, and further studies are needed to explore this potential relationship.\nFinally, the lack of LTP restoration by Tulrampator suggests that additional mechanisms beyond AMPAR modulation may be involved, an avenue worth exploring in future work.\nMale adult rats received bilateral injections of oligomeric α-synuclein (OSyn rats) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, sham rats) into the dorsal striatum. Subsequently, behavioral phenotypes were assessed, and the rats were sacrificed for immunohistochemical and electrophysiological recordings.

After washing, the sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies, including Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-guinea pig IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rat IgG (1:200; ThermoFisher Scientific). Subsequently, the sections were mounted using an anti-fade medium (Fluoromount; Sigma) and examined under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (NIKON TiE2).

While the model successfully captures some early synaptic dysfunctions, it does not replicate the advanced stages of PD, as indicated by the preserved integrity of SN dopaminergic neurons and the absence of significant reductions in DAT or TH levels. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed through the open-field test, which, although a reliable first-line tool, would benefit from complementary behavioral paradigms in future studies to strengthen these findings. Moreover, the variability in mobility observed in this task may reflect early, subtle changes rather than a clear motor deficit. While a DMSO-only control group was not included in Tulrampator experiments, previous studies have demonstrated the non-toxicity of the dose used, supporting the interpretation of Tulrampator-specific effects.\nThe detection of p-α-syn in the cortex supports a pattern of local accumulation following OSyn injection; however, we recognize that the extent of α-synuclein aggregation observed may exceed what is typically reported in prodromal PD brains. A potential confounding effect related to the injection route of OSyn cannot be fully excluded. Our data support the idea that p-α-syn accumulation alone can affect cortico-striatal function. However, we acknowledge that a causal link between this dysfunction and prodromal anxiety-like symptoms in PD remains to be clearly established, and further studies are needed to explore this potential relationship.\nFinally, the lack of LTP restoration by Tulrampator suggests that additional mechanisms beyond AMPAR modulation may be involved, an avenue worth exploring in future work.\nMale adult rats received bilateral injections of oligomeric α-synuclein (OSyn rats) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, sham rats) into the dorsal striatum. Subsequently, behavioral phenotypes were assessed, and the rats were sacrificed for immunohistochemical and electrophysiological recordings. Additionally, one cohort of animals received treatment with the ampakine Tulrampator before the behavioral, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological analyses (Fig.\nMale adult Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 250–275 g at the beginning of the experiments were utilized. This study was designed and reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines for animal research. All procedures involving live animals were performed in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the European Directive 2010/63/EU and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Perugia (Italy), as well as the Italian Ministry of Health (N.75/2021-PR). The animals were housed in two per cage with free access to water and food and were kept under constant temperature, humidity, and a 12 h light/dark cycle. Rats were allocated randomly to various experimental groups. Experimenters were blinded to the experimental group assignments during data collection.\nLyophilized monomeric α-syn (recombinant human α-syn, Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in sterile PBS to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml (70 µm). α-Syn oligomers were generated by continuous shaking (600 rpm) at 37 °C for 2 h. The aggregation process was monitored by thioflavin T assay in a CLARIOstar reader (BMG LABTECH). Oligomer formation was confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (AURIGA Zeiss) (Fig.\nSurgical procedures were conducted on deeply anesthetized rats aged 7–8 weeks [using Zoletil 20 mg/kg combined with xylazine 9 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally (i.p.)]. The animals received two bilateral intrastriatal injections (1 µl at each site) of either OSyn (1 mg/ml dissolved in PBS) or PBS. Stereotaxic striatal injection coordinates, referenced with a tooth bar set at 0.00, were as follows: (i) anteroposterior (AP) + 1.0, mediolateral (ML) + 3.0, dorsoventral (DV) −5.0; and (ii) AP + 1.0, ML −3.0, DV −5.0\nTulrampator (also known as s-47445) was prepared at the working concentration by diluting it in a suspension containing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10%, polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300) at 40%, Tween 80 at 5%, and saline at 45%, following the manufacturer’s instructions for in vivo treatment (MedChemExpress, CAS no. 1038984-31-4). The suspension contained 100 μl/kg DMSO, a dose known to be well below the maximum tolerated dose for rats (5 ml/kg, chronic administration) and not to cause harm, inflammation, or affect locomotor activity\nAnimals underwent open-field test and home-cage observation at 12 weeks post-OSyn or PBS injection. Behavioral assessments were conducted consistently within the same room and at the same time of day, administered by an investigator blinded to the rat’s condition. The behavior was manually scored by blinded operators using timing recording software (ODLog, Macropod Software). General locomotor activity was evaluated using the open-field task, which involved a 10-min habituation followed by a 10-min testing period during the animals’ active phase, as previously described\nAdditionally, rats were observed within their home cages, maintained under standard housing conditions (12:12 h light/dark cycle, lights on at 7 a.m., room temperature maintained at 23 °C, with food and water\nRats were euthanized following deep sedation. Upon dissection, the brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma Aldrich) at 4 °C for a minimum of 24 h, then transferred to a PBS solution containing 30% sucrose and 0.02% sodium azide and stored at 4 °C for at least another 24 h or until sectioning. Brain sections (30 μm thick) were obtained using a cryostat (Leica CM1900) and stored in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C until subsequent histological procedures.\nFor immunohistochemistry, primary and secondary antibody solutions, as well as ExtrAvidin solutions, were prepared in PB containing 0.3% Triton X-100. Each incubation step was followed by 5-min rinses in PB, repeated three times. For immunoperoxidase staining, sections were treated with 0.3% H2O2 for 5 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Subsequently, they were incubated for 48 h at 4 °C with a solution containing a mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich; MAB318), followed by a 2-h incubation with a biotinylated donkey anti-mouse antibody (1:200, Jackson Immunoresearch). The sections were then incubated for another 2 h in an ExtrAvidin solution (1:1000; Sigma Aldrich), and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) 0.05% was used as the chromogen. Finally, sections were mounted on chrome-alum-coated slides, air-dried, dehydrated, and coverslipped.\nFor immunofluorescence staining, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, including rabbit anti-phosphorylated α-syn (phosphoS129; 1:100; Abcam; #ab51253) and mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:1000; Sigma Aldrich; MAB318), in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.3% Triton X-100. Subsequently, the sections were incubated for 2 h with a cocktail of secondary antibodies, including Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Invitrogen). Neuronal cells were counterstained with DAPI or NeuroTrace™ 455 green fluorescent Nissl-Stain. Confocal images were acquired using a Nikon Confocal Microscope (NIKON TiE2). Additionally, brain sections were incubated with guinea pig anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1; 1:800, Synaptic System; #135304), guinea pig anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2; 1:800, Synaptic System; #135404), and anti-dopamine transporter (DAT, 1:1000; Sigma Aldrich; MAB369) antibodies. After washing, the sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies, including Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-guinea pig IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rat IgG (1:200; ThermoFisher Scientific). Subsequently, the sections were mounted using an anti-fade medium (Fluoromount; Sigma) and examined under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (NIKON TiE2). The specificity of immunohistochemical labeling was confirmed by the omission of primary antibodies and the use of normal serum instead (negative controls).\nThe analysis of SNpc was performed on brain sections from five animals per group. The SNpc was outlined using the 4× objective, while the 100X oil immersion objective was used for neuronal cell count. A Stereo Investigator System (MicroBrightField Europe e.K., Magdeburg, Germany) that included a three-dimensional optical fractionator counting probe (\nDensitometric analysis of DAT, VGluT1, and VGluT2 was performed on rat brain sections. To avoid staining variability among sections and experimental groups, sections were incubated with the same cocktail of primary and secondary antibodies at the same time. Furthermore, the confocal settings for image capture were kept constant throughout the acquisition of sections from both groups of rats. After confocal, images were exported in TIFF and analyzed with ImageJ software (\nRats were euthanized by decapitation 12 weeks post-surgery, and 220 µm-thick cortico-striatal coronal brain slices were prepared using a vibratome. Slices were maintained in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), which was continuously bubbled with a 95% O\nWhole-cell patch-clamp recordings were conducted from SPNs that were visualized using infrared differential interference contrast microscopy (Olympus) in the dorsal striatum. Only SPNs selected on the basis of their intrinsic membrane properties were included in the study. The whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (with access resistance of 15–30 MΩ and a holding potential of −80 mV) were performed using borosilicate pipettes (4–7 MΩ) filled with an internal solution consisting of: 145 m MK\nThe sample size calculation (rats required) was performed in advance using G*Power3 software, with power and confidence levels set to 80% and 95%, respectively, while estimating effect magnitude and standard deviation.

They critically influence the timing of sensory system critical periods, as well as processes underlying learning, memory, and higher cognitive functions. Furthermore, dysregulation of PNN density and architecture have been associated with conditions like autism, neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease. Since they are extensively involved in brain function, we discuss the multitude of regulatory factors that govern the formation, maturation, and remodeling of PNNs. In particular, we focus on both molecular and cellular brain-intrinsic mechanisms, highlighting the potential contributions of microglia and astrocyte derived factors.

Perineuronal nets (PNNs), dense extracellular matrix (ECM) structures enwrapping the soma and dendrites of a large number of neurons in the brain, represent crucial regulators of such processes.\nInterest in PNNs has steadily increased over the past two decades, as their involvement in key brain functions has been demonstrated across multiple brain regions (Fig.\nDuring adulthood, PNNs stabilize acquired neural representations and memories in multiple regions. PNN depletion affects spatial maps in the grid cell network [\nFrom a molecular point of view, PNNs are composed of a lattice-like scaffold of hyaluronic acid chains and chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), connected by link proteins and tenascin-R [\nDue to their tight involvement in plasticity processes, PNNs are associated with various pathological conditions. In the context of brain injury, CSPG expression is upregulated in the glial scar and, in the dorsal root ganglia, acts as an inhibitor of axon growth [\nWhile the limitation of neuroplasticity is sometimes viewed as a constraint, it also serves essential functions. Controlled plasticity ensures stability in neural circuits, and prevents maladaptive changes. Alterations in PNNs have indeed been reported in multiple models of neurodevelopmental disorders [\nIn addition to their plasticity-limiting role, PNNs and their molecular constituents can display a neuroprotective function [\nDespite the general role in controlling plasticity in multiple brain areas, PNN distribution in the adult brain is not uniform. In the mouse, the highest levels are found in the midbrain, the hindbrain and the cortex, particularly in primary sensory regions [\nThe regional heterogeneity in PNN distribution and composition, as well as in the time course required for their formation suggest that these structures are tightly regulated and controlled across the entire lifespan. The mechanisms underlying PNN formation and maturation are crucial for circuit-specific control of plasticity.\nWhile the functions of PNNs in physiological and pathological contexts have been extensively reviewed [\n\nFunctional roles of PNNs across multiple brain regions. Regional specificity of PNN-mediated control of neural plasticity is suggestive of the action of complex regulatory networks both in postnatal development and in adulthood. The cartoon of the mouse brain was created with Brainrender [\nRegulating neural plasticity during early postnatal life is essential to guide neural circuits along a healthy developmental path, ultimately enhancing their functional efficiency in adulthood. For these reasons, the formation of PNNs is not a completely spontaneous event but instead an actively regulated process that must be initiated and timely controlled (Fig.\nPNNs are highly complex molecular structures, composed of a variety of proteins and CSPGs. Therefore, the biosynthetic processes of each of these constituents offer multiple regulatory hubs that enable tight control over PNN formation.\nThe building blocks of PNNs are produced by different cell types, including neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes [\nIn addition to the production of molecular components, studies have shown the importance of sugar moiety modifications, particularly the sulfation patterns of glycosaminoglycans, as a regulatory ‘code’ that modulates PNN function. As mentioned before, CSPGs are crucial elements of PNN scaffold and are composed of a core protein to which a number of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CS-GAG) chains are attached. During the synthesis of CS-GAG chains, sulfate groups are added by sulfotransferase enzymes [\nDue to their proximity to the cell membrane and to the biochemical properties of CSPGs, PNNs can capture and concentrate diffusible molecules acting as long-range signaling cues. Long-range signaling is crucial for coordinating the maturation of functionally related networks. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to suppress development of GABAergic neurons in the rodent cortex. Administration of EGF to cultured neurons and EGF overexpression in transgenic mouse models reduces aggregation of PNNs around PV neurons, increasing the enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) [\nThe action of PNNs in critical period timing is also regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. For instance, miR-29a is a microRNA upregulated with age across different species and tissues [\nIn some brain regions, PNNs are also associated with specific connectivity patterns. In the cortex, the highest levels of PNN expression is found in the thalamic recipient layer 4 of primary sensory cortices and in PV-rich areas connected into intracortical networks [\nThese regulatory elements do not act independently, but actually cooperate for proper critical period timing and circuit maturation. The changing sulfation pattern of PNNs alters significantly the interactions with signaling molecules. Mice overexpressing chondroitin-6-sulfotransferase, the enzyme responsible for the juvenile C6S sulfation, show an abnormal development of PNNs in the visual cortex, revealed by reduced reactivity to WFA, and lower accumulation of OTX2 both before and after the critical period closure. This ultimately results in impaired formation of thalamocortical synapses onto PNN + neurons and retention of ocular dominance plasticity in adulthood [\nTogether, these findings underscore that PNN formation is a tightly orchestrated process, and that these structures integrate multiple intrinsic molecular cues, activity-dependent mechanisms, and biochemical signals to ensure proper maturation of neural circuits.\nWhile neural plasticity is most prominent during development, it remains essential in adulthood for processes such as learning, memory, and adaptive responses to experience. Therefore, multiple factors continue to regulate PNNs in the adult brain to balance stability with the need for ongoing plasticity, ensuring neural circuits remain adaptable while preserving functional integrity (Fig.\nAs previously mentioned, the process of memory formation, consolidation and maintenance require intact PNNs, as they are impaired by PNN depletion obtained with local injection of PNN-degrading enzyme ChABC [\nDuring learning, specific signaling pathways can act on plasticity to interfere with PNN expression. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling has been associated with learning and memory [\nAs in development, another factor potentially capable of reshaping PNNs, promoting plasticity phenomena and paving the way for circuit rearrangements is neural activity. Indeed, in the cortex, chemogenetic inhibition of either excitatory or PV-expressing inhibitory neurons triggers a decrease in PNN density, highlighting the dependence of these structures on patterns of activity of the local microcircuit [\nWhile the dependence of PNNs on neural activity has been consistently shown in multiple studies, the mechanism underlied by this regulation is not completely understood. A possible way by which PNNs can respond to neural activity is the controlled expression of activity-dependent genes that modulate the ECM. NPTX2, for instance, is a member of the neuronal pentraxin family of calcium-dependent lectins and is regulated as an immediate-early gene [\nEnvironmental factors and experience can reactivate plasticity in the adult brain. For example, rearing mice in an enriched environment (EE)—a paradigm that enhances sensory, cognitive, and social stimulation—can promote reactivation of juvenile plasticity and, consistently, a reduction of PNNs in the visual cortex [\nAltogether, these findings demonstrate that PNNs in the adult brain are dynamic structures, shaped by learning, neural activity, and environmental experience. This regulation maintains a balance between stability and plasticity, supporting both memory consolidation and adaptive circuit remodeling. Elucidating the molecular and activity-dependent mechanisms underlying PNN dynamics will be key to understanding how experience influences long-term cognitive function and to developing strategies for modulating plasticity in neurological disorders.\n\nRegulation of PNNs during development and adulthood. Molecular and physiological factors promoting circuit maturation during postnatal development are involved in the accumulation of PNNs. During adulthood, events requiring plasticity, like memory formation and consolidation, affect PNN maintenance and function. Notably, PNNs integrate both brain-intrinsic and systemic cues, such as nutrition and hormonal landscape\nAs described in the previous sections, PNNs were initially characterized in cortical areas and were associated with sensory processing and memory [\nPNN-like structures have been identified within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) [\nBeyond development, hypothalamic PNNs exhibit ongoing remodelling and regulation in adulthood, influenced by sex, gonadal hormones, and metabolic status. Studies in adult mice revealed that gonadal hormones are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of PNNs specifically within the ARC. a portion of PNN-enmeshed ARC neurons express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and a majority express the androgen receptor. Indeed, surgical gonadectomy significantly reduced both WFA intensity and the number of PNN-enwrapped cells in the ARC, an effect observed in both sexes. Intriguingly, the terete hypothalamic nucleus (TE) shows significant sex dimorphism, with females displaying higher PNN WFA fluorescence intensity than males. Furthermore, PNNs in the TE are sensitive to diet in a sex-specific manner; chronic high-fat diet (HFD, 60% Kcal from fat) feeding significantly increased PNN intensity in females but had no effect in males. Finally, PNNs observed in other hypothalamic nuclei, such as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus(PVH), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), did not show significant regulation by sex or HFD consumption [\nThe ME is another key site of PNN plasticity directly linked to the nutritional state. PNNs in the ME undergo rapid remodeling in response to acute changes in the feeding state. Kohnke et al. demonstrated that refeeding after an overnight fast triggers a rapid increase in the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes specifically within the ME. Intriguingly, this nutritionally-driven oligodendrocyte differentiation is directly linked to PNN remodeling. Fasting reduces, while refeeding rapidly increases, the density of ME PNNs. This reshaping is dependent on OPC differentiation, as the deletion of the transcription factor Myelin regulatory factor (Myrf) in OPC blunts the PNN response to refeeding. Furthermore, the PNN-degrading enzyme ADAMTS4 shows increased expression in ME oligodendrocytes during fasting, potentially contributing to PNN breakdown. Importantly, this rapid PNN remodeling in the ME is functionally relevant for energy balance. Enzymatic digestion of ARC/ME PNNs using ChABC in lean mice led to increased food intake and weight gain, demonstrating that intact ME PNNs are required for normal energy homeostasis maintenance [\nThe remodelling of PNNs in key hypothalamic nuclei for metabolic homeostasis maintenance may be crucial for the development and progression of pathological states. Recent evidence indicates that established metabolic diseases (obesity and type 2 diabetes) are associated with a distinct, pathological PNN alteration in the ARC, termed neurofibrosis. In both high fat high sugar (HFHS, 45% kcal from fat) diet-induced obese (DIO) and genetically diabetic (db/db) mice, the ARC shows significant remodeling of the PNN, including increased WFA staining, elevated aggrecan deposition, and altered CS-GAG sulfation (notably a higher 4 S/6S ratio). These changes occur specifically around AgRP neurons and progress with the metabolic disease. The authors hypothesized that neurofibrosis is the result of reduced PNN turnover in obesity. In DIO mice, PNN degradation is slower than in lean controls and is associated with lower expression of ECM proteases. Functionally, ARC neurofibrosis impairs insulin access to neurons by forming a physical and electrostatic barrier. Hypothalamic insulin signaling, tested through phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and AKT, is reduced in DIO mice but restored by enzymatic PNN removal with ChABC, which mechanistically should disrupt the insulin-GAG binding and sequestration. Remarkably, stereotaxic injections of ChABC in DIO or\nIn contrast to this discovery, a different study demonstrated that the abundance of PNNs enmeshing ARC neurons is decreased in DIO mice compared to lean control diet fed animals. This loss was also associated with increases of ARC microgliosis and astrogliosis suggesting a link between ARC PNN loss and glial activation. ChABC-driven depletion of ARC PNNs exacerbates the metabolic impact of a HFHS diet in rats. Specifically, PNN digestion led to increased hyperphagia, greater weight gain, and elevated fat accumulation, primarily driven by enhanced food intake [\nThese contrasting findings suggest that ARC PNNs may play a role in energy balance, and that their dysregulation could contribute to the development of obesity and insulin resistance. However, further investigation is needed to determine whether they are causative, and how they might be effectively targeted.\nThe influence of diet, particularly HFD, on PNN plasticity extends beyond the hypothalamus. Studies in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) reveal complex, region-specific, and sex-dependent effects of HFD on PNNs, which also vary based on inherent susceptibility to obesity. In obesity-prone (OP) and standard Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats, chronic HFD reduced PNN intensity in the prelimbic (PL) and ventromedial orbitofrontal (vmOFC) subregions. In contrast, HFD increased PNN intensity in the infralimbic (IL) PFC of female OP/SD rats. Obesity-resistant (OR) rats showed opposite responses, with males exhibiting increased PNN intensity in the vmOFC and females showing decreased intensity in the IL-PFC after HFD [\nThe studies reviewed here powerfully illustrate that PNN formation, maintenance, and remodeling are not solely governed by local neuronal activity or developmental programs within the brain. Instead, PNNs in metabolic circuits exist at a nexus, integrating both local and long-range signals. Peripheral metabolic/sexual hormones regulate PNN formation, and intriguingly the systemic metabolic status influences PNN assembly and turnover in the hypothalamus. This complex interplay underscores the role of PNNs as dynamic integrators, situated at key brain–body interfaces like the ARC-ME site, translating peripheral metabolic information into structural changes that regulate neuronal function and likely circuit stability, impacting whole-body energy homeostasis.\nGlial cells, historically viewed as passive scaffolding, are now understood to play dynamic and regulatory roles in neural signaling and plasticity. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the brain, are crucially involved in the maintenance of potassium homeostasis and in the uptake of glutamate at synapses [\nAstrocytes are a substantial source of ECM components throughout development and adulthood. However, the fraction of these molecules eventually incorporated in the developing PNNs is still debated. PNN-like structures have been reported in cultures of neurons without astrocytes [\nDuring the visual cortex critical period, astrocytes increase their expression of the gap junction channel subunit connexin 30 (Cx30). Through an atypical signaling pathway, Cx30 downregulates the RhoA-matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) pathway. This cascade leads to reduced levels of MMP9, an enzyme that degrades ECM components, consequently promoting the maturation and condensation of PNNs around inhibitory neurons and contributing to the closure of critical period for ocular dominance [\nIn the adult brain, astrocytes are essential for synaptic homeostasis as they intimately interact with both the pre- and post- synaptic terminals, in tight association with the ECM and microglia creating structures increasingly termed ‘tripartite’ or even ‘tetrapartite’ synapses ([\nThe interplay between ECM and astrocytes is also evident in pathological conditions. In disease and neuroinflammatory conditions astrocytes transition in a so-called reactive state undergoing morphological and molecular changes [\nIt is worth noting that it is still hard to disentangle the action of astrocytes on aggregated PNNs from their regulation of the diffuse ECM. Astrocytes exert a broad action on several ECM components and the regulation of PNNs can be considered part of a much broader picture. Recent evidence showed that during synaptogenesis astrocytes secrete neurocan (NCAN) that is cleaved in two fragments. The one containing the C-terminal domain is soluble and does not take part of PNN formation. This fragment strongly regulates the formation of somatostatin-positive inhibitory synapses, which is impaired in mice lacking either the entire\nCollectively these studies indicate that astrocytes might be in a unique position to regulate PNN at multiple scales: from the microenvironment of the synaptic cleft, up to the larger context of the glial scar.\nMicroglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are now known to perform functions far beyond classical immunity [\nMicroglia, the resident immune cells and macrophages of the CNS, are increasingly recognized for functions extending far beyond classical immunity [\nDirect physical interaction and engulfment of ECM components by microglia is increasingly documented across various contexts. Following peripheral nerve injury (spared nerve injury, SNI model), microglia in the spinal cord dorsal horn become activated and contain WFA immunoreactivity within their lysosomes [\nWhile disease states clearly show engulfment, microglia seem to interact with PNNs under baseline conditions. Recent work highlights a fundamental role for microglia cells in clearing perisynaptic ECM (including CSPGs like aggrecan and brevican) via phagocytosis in the healthy adult hippocampus, a process regulated by the neuron-derived cytokine IL-33, which is modulated by experience. Loss of IL-33 or its microglial receptor IL1RL1 impaired ECM engulfment and led to ECM accumulation around synapses associated with impairment in memory consolidation in mice [\nImportantly, experimental manipulations are able to activate microglia phagocytic capacity. Repeated anesthetic ketamine exposure, which induces PNN loss, leads to microglia closely interacting with PV + neurons and containing WFA + fragments. Live ex vivo imaging of primary somatosensory cortex coronal slices confirms that microglia cells actively survey WFA-labeled structures and accumulate WFA + material internally over time following ketamine treatment [\nRemarkably, postnatal development microglia phagocytic activity of synapses and PNNs in the mediobasal hypothalamus have been implicated in systemic glucose tolerance. In mice, transiently depleting microglia before weaning (postnatal day [P]6–16) but not afterward (P21–31) induces glucose intolerance in adulthood due to impaired insulin responsiveness, which is linked to PNN overabundance and reduced autonomic synaptic connectivity between hypothalamic glucoregulatory neurons and the pancreatic beta cell compartment. The authors conclude that neonatal hypothalamic microglia help program the ability of the CNS to properly potentiate glucose-responsive pancreatic insulin secretion in adulthood by determining the autonomic connectivity of hypothalamic neurons, including those involved in glucose sensing, with the pancreatic beta cell compartment [\nThe signals triggering PNN engulfment are still being elucidated. While classical “eat-me” markers like phosphatidylserine (PS) mediate microglial pruning of synapses, and complement factors (C1q, C3) are involved [\nFurther evidence of the link between ECM remodelling and microglia is that microglia secrete various proteases capable of degrading ECM components, offering an alternative or complementary mechanism to direct phagocytosis. For instance, MMP9 expression is upregulated in microglia (and astrocytes) in the ventral horn of ALS mouse model, coinciding with PNN breakdown. Interestingly, MMP9 inhibition or genetic ablation is protective in ALS models [\nWe could speculate that microglia dependent enzymatic degradation and phagocytosis work in concert. Proteases released by microglia could ‘prime’ the PNN by cleaving core proteins or GAG chains, creating fragments or altering the structure to make it more amenable to subsequent engulfment.\nA striking feature emerging from the above-mentioned studies is that microglia could interact with PNNs and ECM both in health and disease state, suggesting that PNN degradation could be related to homeostatic function as well as to pathological conditions. Thus, the interaction between microglia and PNNs may be tightly regulated with significant functional consequences. Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling is critical, as both genetic haploinsufficiency as observed in the\nThe switch in microglial function from homeostatic maintenance to active PNN degradation may be triggered upon encountering pathological stimuli or inflammatory cues. The precise triggers for this switch likely vary depending on the specific disease context and brain region. It could involve inflammatory signals (e.g. TNFalpha), neuronal stress signals (e.g. CX3CL1, or other chemokines), or direct interaction with pathological proteins like Aβ. Understanding the signals that govern the switch between homeostatic maintenance and pathological degradation of PNNs and ECM in general by microglia holds significant therapeutic potential for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Modulating microglial activity, perhaps via CSF1R signaling or through P2RY12, to modulate PNN loss or promote appropriate remodeling could represent a novel strategy to preserve neuronal function, promote synaptic plasticity and combat disease progression.\n\nRegulation of PNNs by glial cells. Microglia and astrocytes influence PNN development and stability both in physiological and in pathological conditions. Microglia is mostly associated with clearance of ECM molecules while astrocytes with their production. Both cell types are involved in regulation of PNNs by matrix metalloproteases and in synaptic homeostasis\nIn this review, we highlight that PNNs—complex extracellular structures involved in regulating multiple plasticity processes during development and adulthood—require tight regulation to ensure proper circuit maturation, physiological brain function, and responses to pathological states. Increasing evidence shows that PNNs are modulated by signaling molecules, neuronal activity, interactions with astrocytes and microglia, and—more recently—by hormones and metabolic factors. We can speculate that PNNs act as an integratory hub shaping neural plasticity in relation to both brain-intrinsic and peripheral cues. However, further research is needed to elucidate how these regulatory mechanisms cooperate and to identify the central nodes in this network of interactors.\nWe discussed how astrocytes are involved in the production of ECM molecules and how, together with microglia, control PNNs especially in a pathological context. However, the cooperative dynamics among these cellular players in orchestrating PNN regulation remain poorly understood.\nOverall, PNN deposition is not solely determined by the cells enwrapped by PNNs themselves, but depends on multiple cell types and, in some cases, on signals originating from distant brain regions or even peripheral tissues. For example, in the brain, many—but not all—PV interneurons are surrounded by PNNs [\nAnother major challenge in studying PNN regulation stems from the complex biology of CSPGs. For instance, the sulfation pattern of CSPG sugar chains—a critical factor influencing PNN properties during development— is studied as a molecular code modulating plasticity, while other sugar modifications and their impact on PNN physiology and plasticity have not been characterized. Recent methodological advances offer promising solutions. For example, spatial omics approaches, including spatial transcriptomics [\nThe complexity of PNN regulation is further compounded by regional differences in PNN composition and dynamics across brain areas. It is conceivable that region-specific connectivity patterns might cause rearrangements of PNN both in development or in adulthood, perhaps driving activity of the local circuits towards a more or less plastic configuration.\nIn addition to this, while attention has been focused on condensed PNNs, the regulation of the diffuse ECM remains poorly understood, as its role in neural plasticity control.\nTechnical advancements are already promising, particularly in the field of optical methods for the visualization of PNNs in vivo, either with fluorescent labeling of WFA or through transgenic models [", "content_for_embedding": "Neural plasticity, the ability of the brain to adapt and reorganize, is essential for learning, memory, and recovery from injury. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), dense extracellular matrix (ECM) structures enwrapping the soma and dendrites of a large number of neurons in the brain, represent crucial regulators of such processes.\nInterest in PNNs has steadily increased over the past two decades, as their involvement in key brain functions has been demonstrated across multiple brain regions (Fig.\nDuring adulthood, PNNs stabilize acquired neural representations and memories in multiple regions. PNN depletion affects spatial maps in the grid cell network [\nFrom a molecular point of view, PNNs are composed of a lattice-like scaffold of hyaluronic acid chains and chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), connected by link proteins and tenascin-R [\nDue to their tight involvement in plasticity processes, PNNs are associated with various pathological conditions. In the context of brain injury, CSPG expression is upregulated in the glial scar and, in the dorsal root ganglia, acts as an inhibitor of axon growth [\nWhile the limitation of neuroplasticity is sometimes viewed as a constraint, it also serves essential functions. Controlled plasticity ensures stability in neural circuits, and prevents maladaptive changes. Alterations in PNNs have indeed been reported in multiple models of neurodevelopmental disorders [\nIn addition to their plasticity-limiting role, PNNs and their molecular constituents can display a neuroprotective function [\nDespite the general role in controlling plasticity in multiple brain areas, PNN distribution in the adult brain is not uniform. In the mouse, the highest levels are found in the midbrain, the hindbrain and the cortex, particularly in primary sensory regions [\nThe regional heterogeneity in PNN distribution and composition, as well as in the time course required for their formation suggest that these structures are tightly regulated and controlled across the entire lifespan. The mechanisms underlying PNN formation and maturation are crucial for circuit-specific control of plasticity.\nWhile the functions of PNNs in physiological and pathological contexts have been extensively reviewed [\n\nFunctional roles of PNNs across multiple brain regions. Regional specificity of PNN-mediated control of neural plasticity is suggestive of the action of complex regulatory networks both in postnatal development and in adulthood. The cartoon of the mouse brain was created with Brainrender [\nRegulating neural plasticity during early postnatal life is essential to guide neural circuits along a healthy developmental path, ultimately enhancing their functional efficiency in adulthood. For these reasons, the formation of PNNs is not a completely spontaneous event but instead an actively regulated process that must be initiated and timely controlled (Fig.\nPNNs are highly complex molecular structures, composed of a variety of proteins and CSPGs. Therefore, the biosynthetic processes of each of these constituents offer multiple regulatory hubs that enable tight control over PNN formation.\nThe building blocks of PNNs are produced by different cell types, including neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes [\nIn addition to the production of molecular components, studies have shown the importance of sugar moiety modifications, particularly the sulfation patterns of glycosaminoglycans, as a regulatory ‘code’ that modulates PNN function. As mentioned before, CSPGs are crucial elements of PNN scaffold and are composed of a core protein to which a number of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CS-GAG) chains are attached. During the synthesis of CS-GAG chains, sulfate groups are added by sulfotransferase enzymes [\nDue to their proximity to the cell membrane and to the biochemical properties of CSPGs, PNNs can capture and concentrate diffusible molecules acting as long-range signaling cues. Long-range signaling is crucial for coordinating the maturation of functionally related networks. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to suppress development of GABAergic neurons in the rodent cortex. Administration of EGF to cultured neurons and EGF overexpression in transgenic mouse models reduces aggregation of PNNs around PV neurons, increasing the enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) [\nThe action of PNNs in critical period timing is also regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. For instance, miR-29a is a microRNA upregulated with age across different species and tissues [\nIn some brain regions, PNNs are also associated with specific connectivity patterns. In the cortex, the highest levels of PNN expression is found in the thalamic recipient layer 4 of primary sensory cortices and in PV-rich areas connected into intracortical networks [\nThese regulatory elements do not act independently, but actually cooperate for proper critical period timing and circuit maturation. The changing sulfation pattern of PNNs alters significantly the interactions with signaling molecules. Mice overexpressing chondroitin-6-sulfotransferase, the enzyme responsible for the juvenile C6S sulfation, show an abnormal development of PNNs in the visual cortex, revealed by reduced reactivity to WFA, and lower accumulation of OTX2 both before and after the critical period closure. This ultimately results in impaired formation of thalamocortical synapses onto PNN + neurons and retention of ocular dominance plasticity in adulthood [\nTogether, these findings underscore that PNN formation is a tightly orchestrated process, and that these structures integrate multiple intrinsic molecular cues, activity-dependent mechanisms, and biochemical signals to ensure proper maturation of neural circuits.\nWhile neural plasticity is most prominent during development, it remains essential in adulthood for processes such as learning, memory, and adaptive responses to experience. Therefore, multiple factors continue to regulate PNNs in the adult brain to balance stability with the need for ongoing plasticity, ensuring neural circuits remain adaptable while preserving functional integrity (Fig.\nAs previously mentioned, the process of memory formation, consolidation and maintenance require intact PNNs, as they are impaired by PNN depletion obtained with local injection of PNN-degrading enzyme ChABC [\nDuring learning, specific signaling pathways can act on plasticity to interfere with PNN expression. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling has been associated with learning and memory [\nAs in development, another factor potentially capable of reshaping PNNs, promoting plasticity phenomena and paving the way for circuit rearrangements is neural activity. Indeed, in the cortex, chemogenetic inhibition of either excitatory or PV-expressing inhibitory neurons triggers a decrease in PNN density, highlighting the dependence of these structures on patterns of activity of the local microcircuit [\nWhile the dependence of PNNs on neural activity has been consistently shown in multiple studies, the mechanism underlied by this regulation is not completely understood. A possible way by which PNNs can respond to neural activity is the controlled expression of activity-dependent genes that modulate the ECM. NPTX2, for instance, is a member of the neuronal pentraxin family of calcium-dependent lectins and is regulated as an immediate-early gene [\nEnvironmental factors and experience can reactivate plasticity in the adult brain. For example, rearing mice in an enriched environment (EE)—a paradigm that enhances sensory, cognitive, and social stimulation—can promote reactivation of juvenile plasticity and, consistently, a reduction of PNNs in the visual cortex [\nAltogether, these findings demonstrate that PNNs in the adult brain are dynamic structures, shaped by learning, neural activity, and environmental experience. This regulation maintains a balance between stability and plasticity, supporting both memory consolidation and adaptive circuit remodeling. Elucidating the molecular and activity-dependent mechanisms underlying PNN dynamics will be key to understanding how experience influences long-term cognitive function and to developing strategies for modulating plasticity in neurological disorders.\n\nRegulation of PNNs during development and adulthood. Molecular and physiological factors promoting circuit maturation during postnatal development are involved in the accumulation of PNNs. During adulthood, events requiring plasticity, like memory formation and consolidation, affect PNN maintenance and function. Notably, PNNs integrate both brain-intrinsic and systemic cues, such as nutrition and hormonal landscape\nAs described in the previous sections, PNNs were initially characterized in cortical areas and were associated with sensory processing and memory [\nPNN-like structures have been identified within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) [\nBeyond development, hypothalamic PNNs exhibit ongoing remodelling and regulation in adulthood, influenced by sex, gonadal hormones, and metabolic status. Studies in adult mice revealed that gonadal hormones are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of PNNs specifically within the ARC. a portion of PNN-enmeshed ARC neurons express estrogen receptor α (ERα) and a majority express the androgen receptor. Indeed, surgical gonadectomy significantly reduced both WFA intensity and the number of PNN-enwrapped cells in the ARC, an effect observed in both sexes. Intriguingly, the terete hypothalamic nucleus (TE) shows significant sex dimorphism, with females displaying higher PNN WFA fluorescence intensity than males. Furthermore, PNNs in the TE are sensitive to diet in a sex-specific manner; chronic high-fat diet (HFD, 60% Kcal from fat) feeding significantly increased PNN intensity in females but had no effect in males. Finally, PNNs observed in other hypothalamic nuclei, such as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus(PVH), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), did not show significant regulation by sex or HFD consumption [\nThe ME is another key site of PNN plasticity directly linked to the nutritional state. PNNs in the ME undergo rapid remodeling in response to acute changes in the feeding state. Kohnke et al. demonstrated that refeeding after an overnight fast triggers a rapid increase in the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes specifically within the ME. Intriguingly, this nutritionally-driven oligodendrocyte differentiation is directly linked to PNN remodeling. Fasting reduces, while refeeding rapidly increases, the density of ME PNNs. This reshaping is dependent on OPC differentiation, as the deletion of the transcription factor Myelin regulatory factor (Myrf) in OPC blunts the PNN response to refeeding. Furthermore, the PNN-degrading enzyme ADAMTS4 shows increased expression in ME oligodendrocytes during fasting, potentially contributing to PNN breakdown. Importantly, this rapid PNN remodeling in the ME is functionally relevant for energy balance. Enzymatic digestion of ARC/ME PNNs using ChABC in lean mice led to increased food intake and weight gain, demonstrating that intact ME PNNs are required for normal energy homeostasis maintenance [\nThe remodelling of PNNs in key hypothalamic nuclei for metabolic homeostasis maintenance may be crucial for the development and progression of pathological states. Recent evidence indicates that established metabolic diseases (obesity and type 2 diabetes) are associated with a distinct, pathological PNN alteration in the ARC, termed neurofibrosis. In both high fat high sugar (HFHS, 45% kcal from fat) diet-induced obese (DIO) and genetically diabetic (db/db) mice, the ARC shows significant remodeling of the PNN, including increased WFA staining, elevated aggrecan deposition, and altered CS-GAG sulfation (notably a higher 4 S/6S ratio). These changes occur specifically around AgRP neurons and progress with the metabolic disease. The authors hypothesized that neurofibrosis is the result of reduced PNN turnover in obesity. In DIO mice, PNN degradation is slower than in lean controls and is associated with lower expression of ECM proteases. Functionally, ARC neurofibrosis impairs insulin access to neurons by forming a physical and electrostatic barrier. Hypothalamic insulin signaling, tested through phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and AKT, is reduced in DIO mice but restored by enzymatic PNN removal with ChABC, which mechanistically should disrupt the insulin-GAG binding and sequestration. Remarkably, stereotaxic injections of ChABC in DIO or\nIn contrast to this discovery, a different study demonstrated that the abundance of PNNs enmeshing ARC neurons is decreased in DIO mice compared to lean control diet fed animals. This loss was also associated with increases of ARC microgliosis and astrogliosis suggesting a link between ARC PNN loss and glial activation. ChABC-driven depletion of ARC PNNs exacerbates the metabolic impact of a HFHS diet in rats. Specifically, PNN digestion led to increased hyperphagia, greater weight gain, and elevated fat accumulation, primarily driven by enhanced food intake [\nThese contrasting findings suggest that ARC PNNs may play a role in energy balance, and that their dysregulation could contribute to the development of obesity and insulin resistance. However, further investigation is needed to determine whether they are causative, and how they might be effectively targeted.\nThe influence of diet, particularly HFD, on PNN plasticity extends beyond the hypothalamus. Studies in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) reveal complex, region-specific, and sex-dependent effects of HFD on PNNs, which also vary based on inherent susceptibility to obesity. In obesity-prone (OP) and standard Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats, chronic HFD reduced PNN intensity in the prelimbic (PL) and ventromedial orbitofrontal (vmOFC) subregions. In contrast, HFD increased PNN intensity in the infralimbic (IL) PFC of female OP/SD rats. Obesity-resistant (OR) rats showed opposite responses, with males exhibiting increased PNN intensity in the vmOFC and females showing decreased intensity in the IL-PFC after HFD [\nThe studies reviewed here powerfully illustrate that PNN formation, maintenance, and remodeling are not solely governed by local neuronal activity or developmental programs within the brain. Instead, PNNs in metabolic circuits exist at a nexus, integrating both local and long-range signals. Peripheral metabolic/sexual hormones regulate PNN formation, and intriguingly the systemic metabolic status influences PNN assembly and turnover in the hypothalamus. This complex interplay underscores the role of PNNs as dynamic integrators, situated at key brain–body interfaces like the ARC-ME site, translating peripheral metabolic information into structural changes that regulate neuronal function and likely circuit stability, impacting whole-body energy homeostasis.\nGlial cells, historically viewed as passive scaffolding, are now understood to play dynamic and regulatory roles in neural signaling and plasticity. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the brain, are crucially involved in the maintenance of potassium homeostasis and in the uptake of glutamate at synapses [\nAstrocytes are a substantial source of ECM components throughout development and adulthood. However, the fraction of these molecules eventually incorporated in the developing PNNs is still debated. PNN-like structures have been reported in cultures of neurons without astrocytes [\nDuring the visual cortex critical period, astrocytes increase their expression of the gap junction channel subunit connexin 30 (Cx30). Through an atypical signaling pathway, Cx30 downregulates the RhoA-matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) pathway. This cascade leads to reduced levels of MMP9, an enzyme that degrades ECM components, consequently promoting the maturation and condensation of PNNs around inhibitory neurons and contributing to the closure of critical period for ocular dominance [\nIn the adult brain, astrocytes are essential for synaptic homeostasis as they intimately interact with both the pre- and post- synaptic terminals, in tight association with the ECM and microglia creating structures increasingly termed ‘tripartite’ or even ‘tetrapartite’ synapses ([\nThe interplay between ECM and astrocytes is also evident in pathological conditions. In disease and neuroinflammatory conditions astrocytes transition in a so-called reactive state undergoing morphological and molecular changes [\nIt is worth noting that it is still hard to disentangle the action of astrocytes on aggregated PNNs from their regulation of the diffuse ECM. Astrocytes exert a broad action on several ECM components and the regulation of PNNs can be considered part of a much broader picture. Recent evidence showed that during synaptogenesis astrocytes secrete neurocan (NCAN) that is cleaved in two fragments. The one containing the C-terminal domain is soluble and does not take part of PNN formation. This fragment strongly regulates the formation of somatostatin-positive inhibitory synapses, which is impaired in mice lacking either the entire\nCollectively these studies indicate that astrocytes might be in a unique position to regulate PNN at multiple scales: from the microenvironment of the synaptic cleft, up to the larger context of the glial scar.\nMicroglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are now known to perform functions far beyond classical immunity [\nMicroglia, the resident immune cells and macrophages of the CNS, are increasingly recognized for functions extending far beyond classical immunity [\nDirect physical interaction and engulfment of ECM components by microglia is increasingly documented across various contexts. Following peripheral nerve injury (spared nerve injury, SNI model), microglia in the spinal cord dorsal horn become activated and contain WFA immunoreactivity within their lysosomes [\nWhile disease states clearly show engulfment, microglia seem to interact with PNNs under baseline conditions. Recent work highlights a fundamental role for microglia cells in clearing perisynaptic ECM (including CSPGs like aggrecan and brevican) via phagocytosis in the healthy adult hippocampus, a process regulated by the neuron-derived cytokine IL-33, which is modulated by experience. Loss of IL-33 or its microglial receptor IL1RL1 impaired ECM engulfment and led to ECM accumulation around synapses associated with impairment in memory consolidation in mice [\nImportantly, experimental manipulations are able to activate microglia phagocytic capacity. Repeated anesthetic ketamine exposure, which induces PNN loss, leads to microglia closely interacting with PV + neurons and containing WFA + fragments. Live ex vivo imaging of primary somatosensory cortex coronal slices confirms that microglia cells actively survey WFA-labeled structures and accumulate WFA + material internally over time following ketamine treatment [\nRemarkably, postnatal development microglia phagocytic activity of synapses and PNNs in the mediobasal hypothalamus have been implicated in systemic glucose tolerance. In mice, transiently depleting microglia before weaning (postnatal day [P]6–16) but not afterward (P21–31) induces glucose intolerance in adulthood due to impaired insulin responsiveness, which is linked to PNN overabundance and reduced autonomic synaptic connectivity between hypothalamic glucoregulatory neurons and the pancreatic beta cell compartment. The authors conclude that neonatal hypothalamic microglia help program the ability of the CNS to properly potentiate glucose-responsive pancreatic insulin secretion in adulthood by determining the autonomic connectivity of hypothalamic neurons, including those involved in glucose sensing, with the pancreatic beta cell compartment [\nThe signals triggering PNN engulfment are still being elucidated. While classical “eat-me” markers like phosphatidylserine (PS) mediate microglial pruning of synapses, and complement factors (C1q, C3) are involved [\nFurther evidence of the link between ECM remodelling and microglia is that microglia secrete various proteases capable of degrading ECM components, offering an alternative or complementary mechanism to direct phagocytosis. For instance, MMP9 expression is upregulated in microglia (and astrocytes) in the ventral horn of ALS mouse model, coinciding with PNN breakdown. Interestingly, MMP9 inhibition or genetic ablation is protective in ALS models [\nWe could speculate that microglia dependent enzymatic degradation and phagocytosis work in concert. Proteases released by microglia could ‘prime’ the PNN by cleaving core proteins or GAG chains, creating fragments or altering the structure to make it more amenable to subsequent engulfment.\nA striking feature emerging from the above-mentioned studies is that microglia could interact with PNNs and ECM both in health and disease state, suggesting that PNN degradation could be related to homeostatic function as well as to pathological conditions. Thus, the interaction between microglia and PNNs may be tightly regulated with significant functional consequences. Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling is critical, as both genetic haploinsufficiency as observed in the\nThe switch in microglial function from homeostatic maintenance to active PNN degradation may be triggered upon encountering pathological stimuli or inflammatory cues. The precise triggers for this switch likely vary depending on the specific disease context and brain region. It could involve inflammatory signals (e.g. TNFalpha), neuronal stress signals (e.g. CX3CL1, or other chemokines), or direct interaction with pathological proteins like Aβ. Understanding the signals that govern the switch between homeostatic maintenance and pathological degradation of PNNs and ECM in general by microglia holds significant therapeutic potential for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Modulating microglial activity, perhaps via CSF1R signaling or through P2RY12, to modulate PNN loss or promote appropriate remodeling could represent a novel strategy to preserve neuronal function, promote synaptic plasticity and combat disease progression.\n\nRegulation of PNNs by glial cells. Microglia and astrocytes influence PNN development and stability both in physiological and in pathological conditions. Microglia is mostly associated with clearance of ECM molecules while astrocytes with their production. Both cell types are involved in regulation of PNNs by matrix metalloproteases and in synaptic homeostasis\nIn this review, we highlight that PNNs—complex extracellular structures involved in regulating multiple plasticity processes during development and adulthood—require tight regulation to ensure proper circuit maturation, physiological brain function, and responses to pathological states. Increasing evidence shows that PNNs are modulated by signaling molecules, neuronal activity, interactions with astrocytes and microglia, and—more recently—by hormones and metabolic factors. We can speculate that PNNs act as an integratory hub shaping neural plasticity in relation to both brain-intrinsic and peripheral cues. However, further research is needed to elucidate how these regulatory mechanisms cooperate and to identify the central nodes in this network of interactors.\nWe discussed how astrocytes are involved in the production of ECM molecules and how, together with microglia, control PNNs especially in a pathological context. However, the cooperative dynamics among these cellular players in orchestrating PNN regulation remain poorly understood.\nOverall, PNN deposition is not solely determined by the cells enwrapped by PNNs themselves, but depends on multiple cell types and, in some cases, on signals originating from distant brain regions or even peripheral tissues. For example, in the brain, many—but not all—PV interneurons are surrounded by PNNs [\nAnother major challenge in studying PNN regulation stems from the complex biology of CSPGs. For instance, the sulfation pattern of CSPG sugar chains—a critical factor influencing PNN properties during development— is studied as a molecular code modulating plasticity, while other sugar modifications and their impact on PNN physiology and plasticity have not been characterized. Recent methodological advances offer promising solutions. For example, spatial omics approaches, including spatial transcriptomics [\nThe complexity of PNN regulation is further compounded by regional differences in PNN composition and dynamics across brain areas. It is conceivable that region-specific connectivity patterns might cause rearrangements of PNN both in development or in adulthood, perhaps driving activity of the local circuits towards a more or less plastic configuration.\nIn addition to this, while attention has been focused on condensed PNNs, the regulation of the diffuse ECM remains poorly understood, as its role in neural plasticity control.\nTechnical advancements are already promising, particularly in the field of optical methods for the visualization of PNNs in vivo, either with fluorescent labeling of WFA or through transgenic models [", "topic": "Neuroinflammation"}

This resurgence of interest is primarily attributed to BBR's diverse pharmacological effects, including its ability to reduce neuroinflammation, regulate hormonal pathways and modulate neurotransmitter activities, thereby providing promising opportunities for the treatment of complex brain disorders [\nThis study lays a robust experimental groundwork for future research into the mechanisms by which BBR exerts its preventive and therapeutic effects on POCD. The results suggest that BBR holds considerable promise as a feasible therapeutic candidate for overcoming the challenges associated with POCD, thereby underscoring its potential for development as a pharmacological intervention.\nMale C57BL/6 mice, aged 16–18 months and weighing 35–40 g, were provided by Sun Yat‐sen University (Guangzhou, China) for this study. The animals were housed in a specific pathogen‐free (SPF) environment with controlled ambient conditions: a temperature of 20°C–24°C, humidity of 40%–60% and a 12‐h light–dark cycle (light period: 07:00–19:00). Mice were randomly assigned into four groups (\nThe schematic timeline of the experimental process.\nThe POCD model was successfully established by integrating isoflurane anaesthesia with exploratory laparotomy [\nBeginning on the day subsequent to their anaesthesia and surgical procedures, elderly mice assigned to the CON + BBR and POCD + BBR groups were subjected to a regimen involving daily intraperitoneal injections. These injections contained BBR (B414323, Aladdin, CHN) at a standardised dose of 10 mg/kg, administered consistently over a two‐week period. This particular dosage is based on preliminary experiments and previous literature [\nBehavioural assessments were conducted in an acoustically isolated chamber from 10:00 to 16:00. Data regarding these behaviours were meticulously documented by two researchers who were not aware of the group assignments of the subjects.\nThe Y‐maze apparatus, specifically designed for the assessment of short‐term spatial memory, comprises a central junction with three arms extending at exactly 120° angles relative to one another. In accordance with our experimental protocol, Y‐maze evaluations were conducted precisely 14 days postsurgical intervention. During these assessments, each mouse was allotted a total of 8 min to freely explore the distinct arms of the maze. Throughout this period, detailed records were maintained of all exploratory behaviours exhibited by the mice. A critical behaviour of interest, referred to as ‘alternation behaviour’, was defined as the consecutive entry of each of the three arms without repetition during a single exploratory cycle. To quantify this behaviour, the percentage of alternation was calculated using the formula: Percentage of alternation (%) = (number of alternation behaviours / (total entries–2)) × 100.\n2 weeks after the surgical procedure, each mouse was placed at the centre of a square arena (40 × 40 × 40 cm) with white acrylic walls, as described in previous studies. A 5‐min acclimatisation period was provided to allow each mouse to adapt to the novel environment. Subsequently, locomotor activity, quantified as the total distance travelled, was recorded for 5 min using a high‐resolution video tracking system interfaced with a computer. Offline analysis of locomotor behaviour was performed using the TopScan software (CleverSys, Reston, VA, USA). Between trials, the arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol to eliminate residual odours and contaminants, ensuring a sterile and controlled experimental setup. All assessments were conducted under dim lighting conditions and at consistent times throughout the testing period to minimise stress and maintain standardised testing conditions.\nFollowing the methodologies outlined in prior studies [\nFor this study, hippocampal tissues were processed using RIPA lysis buffer (P0013B, Beyotime, China), a common choice for thorough protein extraction. The concentration of the extracted proteins was accurately assessed utilising a BCA protein assay kit (P0010, Beyotime, China), ensuring precise measurement for subsequent analyses. Following protein isolation, samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS‐PAGE gels (P0012A, Beyotime, China) to achieve separation based on molecular weight. These proteins were then electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (ISEQ00010, Merck Millipore, USA), which provide a stable and reliable medium for protein transfer. To minimise background noise during detection, the membranes were incubated in a solution of 5% skimmed milk (A600669, Sangon Biotech, China) for 1 h at room temperature, effectively blocking nonspecific protein sites. The primary antibodies, carefully chosen for their specificity, were applied to the membranes and left to bind overnight at 4°C. These antibodies included rabbit polyclonal antimouse TNF‐α (1:1000, AF8208, Beyotime, China), rabbit polyclonal antimouse IL‐1β (1:1000, AF7209, Beyotime, China) and rabbit monoclonal antimouse GAPDH (1:1000, AF1216, Beyotime, China), each targeted to identify specific cellular markers. Postprimary incubation, the membranes were treated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‐conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1:5000, A0208, Beyotime, China) at room temperature for 1 h, facilitating the enzymatic detection of the primary antibody complexes. Visualisation of protein bands was conducted using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (WBKLS0100, Merck Millipore, USA), providing high‐sensitivity detection of protein expressions. The bands were then quantitatively analysed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), allowing for detailed analysis and comparison of protein levels across samples. This protocol ensured a rigorous approach to the qualitative and quantitative analysis of specific protein markers within hippocampal tissue, crucial for investigating cellular mechanisms linked to neurological health and disease.\nBrain tissues were preserved using OCT compound and sectioned into slices with a thickness of 25 μm. These sections were subjected to triple washing with phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) to remove any residual OCT compound from their surfaces. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with goat serum (Catalogue No. 16210072, Gibco, United States) for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding sites. The tissue samples were then incubated overnight at 4°C with a rabbit polyclonal anti‐GFAP antibody raised in mouse (dilution 1:100, Catalogue No. BA0094, Boster, China) for specific staining. Following a 1‐h rewarming period at room temperature, the sections underwent another triple wash with PBS and were treated with donkey antimouse IgG (H + L) highly cross‐adsorbed secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (dilution 1:1000, Catalogue No. A‐31571, Invitrogen, United States) and CY3‐labelled goat antimouse IgG (dilution 1:500, Catalogue No. A0562, Beyotime, China) for 2 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Catalogue No. G1012, Servicebio, China) for 20 min at room temperature. After staining, the sections were sealed with an antifluorescence quenching agent (Catalogue No. P0128M, Beyotime, China) to preserve fluorescence. High‐resolution images of these sections were acquired using a laser confocal microscope at 200 × magnification (Zeiss LSM 800 with Airyscan, Germany).\nWash the prepared brain sections three times with PBS for 5–10 min each time, followed by washing in 60% isopropanol for 5 min. After washing, transfer the sections to oil red O staining solution for 15 min, avoiding light. Then soak in 60% isopropanol for 1 min, wash with distilled water and place the sections in haematoxylin for 5 min to stain the cell nucleus. After washing with triple distilled water again, rapidly differentiate with 1% hydrochloric acid alcohol for 1–2 s and then slowly wash with flowing water for 1–3 h to restore the cell nucleus to blue. Finally, seal the stained sections with glycerol gelatin and place them under the microscope for observation.\nTotal RNA was extracted from frozen hippocampal tissue using the Trizol method, followed by reaction in a pre‐configured reverse transcription system to obtain cDNA.

The assay was performed in strict accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The activities of ROS, MDA and SOD were precisely determined by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 532 nm using a microplate reader (TECAN Spark 10 M, China). The results were normalised to protein content and expressed as units per milligram of protein to ensure data consistency and comparability.\nInitially, the three‐dimensional structural data of BBR (BBR) were retrieved in SDF format from the PubChem database (\nFollowing target acquisition, all identified proteins underwent deduplication and standardisation through the UniProt database (\nThe intersection between BBR's putative targets and POCD‐related targets was determined through Venn analysis, yielding candidate targets for further investigation. These overlapping targets were then subjected to protein–protein interaction (PPI) network construction via the STRING database (\nThe resultant network was visualised and topologically analysed using Cytoscape 3.8.0 (\nThe summarised data for all experimental outcomes were systematically presented as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.)

The findings were presented as mean ± SD,\nThe improvement of BBR on POCD‐related behavioural symptoms has attracted significant attention. To comprehensively investigate the mechanism by which BBR acts on POCD, we employed a network pharmacology approach to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Network pharmacology serves as a systematic research methodology for exploring drug‐disease relationships and plays a crucial role in identifying potential targets and pathways. Initially, we systematically aggregated 303 potential targets of BBR from multiple authoritative databases, including PharmaMapper, Swiss Target Prediction and TCMSP. Simultaneously, our comprehensive search in the GeneCards database identified 1691 disease‐related targets associated with POCD. Through a rigorous comparative analysis of these datasets, we pinpointed 152 overlapping targets, which were implicated as key mediators in BBR's potential therapeutic effects on POCD (Figure\nAnalysis of network pharmacology for BBR in POCD management.

A significant increase in the number of GFAP‐positive astrocytes was observed in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus following anaesthesia and surgical intervention. Notably, the administration of BBR effectively reversed these changes, significantly attenuating the elevated levels of activated astrocytes (Figure\nBBR efficacy in reducing glial activation and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus following anaesthesia and surgical interventions.

(B) The statistical chart of lipid accumulation region in oil red staining showed that lipid deposition increased significantly in POCD group and BBR inhibited lipid deposition,\nAdditionally, current studies suggest that excessive lipid accumulation may induce mitochondrial stress, which could subsequently lead to neuronal injury and apoptosis. In this regard, we assessed lipid accumulation in the hippocampus using Oil Red O staining techniques. The results revealed that anaesthesia and surgical procedures significantly enhanced lipid deposition within the hippocampus. Conversely, BBR treatment markedly attenuated this lipid accumulation (Figure\nNetwork pharmacology analysis revealed that BBR could potentially alleviate the symptoms of POCD by modulating the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is a critical regulator of diverse cellular functions and has been increasingly acknowledged for its central role in inflammatory diseases [\nModulation of the PI3K/AKT/AMPK/mTOR pathway by BBR in POCD.

The BBR plays a protective role in preventing hippocampal injury in mice induced by surgery and anaesthesia. Specifically, BBR activates PPAR‐γ mRNA expression, which subsequently mitigates neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism disorders via the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway.\nThe POCD is a clinically significant neurocognitive disorder that frequently affects elderly patients following surgical procedures. It manifests through a spectrum of symptoms, including psychosis, anxiety, changes in personality and impaired memory function. Notably, POCD exhibits a high prevalence after cardiac surgeries as well as various noncardiac interventions, such as abdominal and thoracic surgeries [\nBerberine, a potent isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from various traditional Chinese medicinal plants, is widely recognised for its diverse therapeutic properties, particularly in the management of metabolic disorders, the inhibition of microbial infections and the treatment of inflammatory conditions [\nNetwork pharmacology serves as an integrative methodology aimed at elucidating complex signalling perturbations and the modalities of drug actions within the context of multifaceted diseases. This approach has become a cornerstone in uncovering the intricate and precise mechanisms underlying drug functionality, thereby enhancing our comprehension of therapeutic interactions and effects [\nNetwork pharmacology has pinpointed the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway as a potentially critical mediator through which BBR may exert its therapeutic effects on POCD. To validate this potential mechanism, our research team embarked on a series of experiments aimed at examining this pathway more closely. Our studies have confirmed that BBR modulates the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, potentially accounting for its effects in mitigating oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and lipid accumulation, which are common contributors to POCD. Further insights into BBR's mechanism suggest that its protective impact on POCD may be linked predominantly to the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, a pathway that has been implicated in a variety of disease states including acute lung injury, osteoarthritis and ischaemic diseases [\nVarious mechanisms are implicated in the pathogenesis of POCD, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and neurodegeneration [\nIn our study, we identified BBR as a potential PPAR‐γ agonist that may contribute to the alleviation of POCD. Peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPARs) comprise a family of nuclear receptor proteins that play essential roles in regulating metabolism, inflammation and oxidative stress [\nHowever, the mechanism by which BBR acts on POCD is both complex and multifaceted. In addition to the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, network pharmacology analysis indicates that other pathways, such as the AGE‐RAGE signalling pathway involved in diabetic complications, may also play a potential role. The AGE‐RAGE signalling pathway reportedly activates tyrosine‐protein kinase JAK2 (JAK2), mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor NF‐kappa‐B (NFκB) and protein kinase C (PKC), thereby inducing inflammation and oxidative stress [\nThe study demonstrated that BBR alleviates cognitive decline and memory impairments by attenuating neuroinflammation‐related and oxidative stress‐associated responses in the hippocampus. Specifically, through the upregulation of PPAR‐γ mRNA expression and the downregulation of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, BBR effectively mitigates oxidative damage, neuroinflammation and lipid accumulation induced by surgical interventions and anaesthesia (as shown in Figure\nAll the data supporting our findings are contained within the manuscript.\n\nAll the animal experiments in the present study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Approval No: SYSU‐IACUC‐2023‐000796) and the Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of Sun Yat‐sen University.\nAll authors agree to publish this article publicly.\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "content_for_embedding": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is commonly identified as a major perioperative complication of the central nervous system in elderly surgical patients, often manifesting as significant changes in personality, reduced social interactions and diminished cognitive abilities [\nBerberine (BBR), a naturally occurring isoquinoline alkaloid derived from various medicinal plants, has recently garnered renewed attention in scientific research due to its potential therapeutic benefits for managing neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. This resurgence of interest is primarily attributed to BBR's diverse pharmacological effects, including its ability to reduce neuroinflammation, regulate hormonal pathways and modulate neurotransmitter activities, thereby providing promising opportunities for the treatment of complex brain disorders [\nThis study lays a robust experimental groundwork for future research into the mechanisms by which BBR exerts its preventive and therapeutic effects on POCD. The results suggest that BBR holds considerable promise as a feasible therapeutic candidate for overcoming the challenges associated with POCD, thereby underscoring its potential for development as a pharmacological intervention.\nMale C57BL/6 mice, aged 16–18 months and weighing 35–40 g, were provided by Sun Yat‐sen University (Guangzhou, China) for this study. The animals were housed in a specific pathogen‐free (SPF) environment with controlled ambient conditions: a temperature of 20°C–24°C, humidity of 40%–60% and a 12‐h light–dark cycle (light period: 07:00–19:00). Mice were randomly assigned into four groups (\nThe schematic timeline of the experimental process.\nThe POCD model was successfully established by integrating isoflurane anaesthesia with exploratory laparotomy [\nBeginning on the day subsequent to their anaesthesia and surgical procedures, elderly mice assigned to the CON + BBR and POCD + BBR groups were subjected to a regimen involving daily intraperitoneal injections. These injections contained BBR (B414323, Aladdin, CHN) at a standardised dose of 10 mg/kg, administered consistently over a two‐week period. This particular dosage is based on preliminary experiments and previous literature [\nBehavioural assessments were conducted in an acoustically isolated chamber from 10:00 to 16:00. Data regarding these behaviours were meticulously documented by two researchers who were not aware of the group assignments of the subjects.\nThe Y‐maze apparatus, specifically designed for the assessment of short‐term spatial memory, comprises a central junction with three arms extending at exactly 120° angles relative to one another. In accordance with our experimental protocol, Y‐maze evaluations were conducted precisely 14 days postsurgical intervention. During these assessments, each mouse was allotted a total of 8 min to freely explore the distinct arms of the maze. Throughout this period, detailed records were maintained of all exploratory behaviours exhibited by the mice. A critical behaviour of interest, referred to as ‘alternation behaviour’, was defined as the consecutive entry of each of the three arms without repetition during a single exploratory cycle. To quantify this behaviour, the percentage of alternation was calculated using the formula: Percentage of alternation (%) = (number of alternation behaviours / (total entries–2)) × 100.\n2 weeks after the surgical procedure, each mouse was placed at the centre of a square arena (40 × 40 × 40 cm) with white acrylic walls, as described in previous studies. A 5‐min acclimatisation period was provided to allow each mouse to adapt to the novel environment. Subsequently, locomotor activity, quantified as the total distance travelled, was recorded for 5 min using a high‐resolution video tracking system interfaced with a computer. Offline analysis of locomotor behaviour was performed using the TopScan software (CleverSys, Reston, VA, USA). Between trials, the arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol to eliminate residual odours and contaminants, ensuring a sterile and controlled experimental setup. All assessments were conducted under dim lighting conditions and at consistent times throughout the testing period to minimise stress and maintain standardised testing conditions.\nFollowing the methodologies outlined in prior studies [\nFor this study, hippocampal tissues were processed using RIPA lysis buffer (P0013B, Beyotime, China), a common choice for thorough protein extraction. The concentration of the extracted proteins was accurately assessed utilising a BCA protein assay kit (P0010, Beyotime, China), ensuring precise measurement for subsequent analyses. Following protein isolation, samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS‐PAGE gels (P0012A, Beyotime, China) to achieve separation based on molecular weight. These proteins were then electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (ISEQ00010, Merck Millipore, USA), which provide a stable and reliable medium for protein transfer. To minimise background noise during detection, the membranes were incubated in a solution of 5% skimmed milk (A600669, Sangon Biotech, China) for 1 h at room temperature, effectively blocking nonspecific protein sites. The primary antibodies, carefully chosen for their specificity, were applied to the membranes and left to bind overnight at 4°C. These antibodies included rabbit polyclonal antimouse TNF‐α (1:1000, AF8208, Beyotime, China), rabbit polyclonal antimouse IL‐1β (1:1000, AF7209, Beyotime, China) and rabbit monoclonal antimouse GAPDH (1:1000, AF1216, Beyotime, China), each targeted to identify specific cellular markers. Postprimary incubation, the membranes were treated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‐conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1:5000, A0208, Beyotime, China) at room temperature for 1 h, facilitating the enzymatic detection of the primary antibody complexes. Visualisation of protein bands was conducted using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (WBKLS0100, Merck Millipore, USA), providing high‐sensitivity detection of protein expressions. The bands were then quantitatively analysed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), allowing for detailed analysis and comparison of protein levels across samples. This protocol ensured a rigorous approach to the qualitative and quantitative analysis of specific protein markers within hippocampal tissue, crucial for investigating cellular mechanisms linked to neurological health and disease.\nBrain tissues were preserved using OCT compound and sectioned into slices with a thickness of 25 μm. These sections were subjected to triple washing with phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) to remove any residual OCT compound from their surfaces. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with goat serum (Catalogue No. 16210072, Gibco, United States) for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding sites. The tissue samples were then incubated overnight at 4°C with a rabbit polyclonal anti‐GFAP antibody raised in mouse (dilution 1:100, Catalogue No. BA0094, Boster, China) for specific staining. Following a 1‐h rewarming period at room temperature, the sections underwent another triple wash with PBS and were treated with donkey antimouse IgG (H + L) highly cross‐adsorbed secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (dilution 1:1000, Catalogue No. A‐31571, Invitrogen, United States) and CY3‐labelled goat antimouse IgG (dilution 1:500, Catalogue No. A0562, Beyotime, China) for 2 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Catalogue No. G1012, Servicebio, China) for 20 min at room temperature. After staining, the sections were sealed with an antifluorescence quenching agent (Catalogue No. P0128M, Beyotime, China) to preserve fluorescence. High‐resolution images of these sections were acquired using a laser confocal microscope at 200 × magnification (Zeiss LSM 800 with Airyscan, Germany).\nWash the prepared brain sections three times with PBS for 5–10 min each time, followed by washing in 60% isopropanol for 5 min. After washing, transfer the sections to oil red O staining solution for 15 min, avoiding light. Then soak in 60% isopropanol for 1 min, wash with distilled water and place the sections in haematoxylin for 5 min to stain the cell nucleus. After washing with triple distilled water again, rapidly differentiate with 1% hydrochloric acid alcohol for 1–2 s and then slowly wash with flowing water for 1–3 h to restore the cell nucleus to blue. Finally, seal the stained sections with glycerol gelatin and place them under the microscope for observation.\nTotal RNA was extracted from frozen hippocampal tissue using the Trizol method, followed by reaction in a pre‐configured reverse transcription system to obtain cDNA. Prepare the system using the SuperReal PreMix kit instruction (FP206‐01, TIANGEN, China) and perform qPCR reaction detection using the Roche LightCycler 480 II Real Time PCR System (Catalogue No. 05015278001, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). The mixed reaction system was preheated at 95°C for 15 min followed by 40 cycle stages: 60°C for 20 s after 95°C for 10 s. Then followed by 1 cycle stage: 72°C for 30 s,95°C for 15 s and finally,60°C for 30 s. The mRNA expressions of PPAR‐γ in hippocampal tissues were detected by 2\nThe concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and orgotein superoxide dismutase (SOD) were quantified using a specialised Lipid Peroxidation Assay Kit (G1706, G4300, GM1133; Servicebio, China). The assay was performed in strict accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The activities of ROS, MDA and SOD were precisely determined by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 532 nm using a microplate reader (TECAN Spark 10 M, China). The results were normalised to protein content and expressed as units per milligram of protein to ensure data consistency and comparability.\nInitially, the three‐dimensional structural data of BBR (BBR) were retrieved in SDF format from the PubChem database (\nFollowing target acquisition, all identified proteins underwent deduplication and standardisation through the UniProt database (\nThe intersection between BBR's putative targets and POCD‐related targets was determined through Venn analysis, yielding candidate targets for further investigation. These overlapping targets were then subjected to protein–protein interaction (PPI) network construction via the STRING database (\nThe resultant network was visualised and topologically analysed using Cytoscape 3.8.0 (\nThe summarised data for all experimental outcomes were systematically presented as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) Comprehensive statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism version 9.5 (San Diego, CA, USA), a robust software tool renowned for its analytical capabilities, supplemented by R software to ensure rigorous data integrity and reliability. To assess inter‐group differences, a one‐way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed, followed by Tukey's post hoc test to evaluate significant pairwise differences among groups. Specifically, the dataset obtained from Y‐maze training sessions underwent a detailed statistical evaluation using two‐way repeated measures ANOVA, which facilitated an in‐depth exploration of both main effects and interactions.

SCD plasma from these 2 groups (n = 40 samples) was cocultured with PBMCs from the same donor as described and used earlier. Conditioned media from these cultures was recovered and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for CCL2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was conducted. CCL2 levels were compared between the 2 groups (high and low CCL2 gene expression) using an independent sample\nOur SCD study population included 149 individuals with SCD (27 from a single-center cohort, 122 from multicenter cohorts).

The average node degree (number of connected nodes with the individual node) was 1.98, indicating the identified protein had an interaction with ∼2 other proteins on average.\nWe found significantly elevated levels of CCL2 in the conditioned media of those with increased CCL2 gene expression when compared with the CCL2 levels of those with decreased CCL2 gene expression. Gene expression of CCL2 is displayed in\nWe identified a set of genes induced by plasma from individuals with SCD that is associated with increased frequency of acute pain episodes. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses plasma-based transcriptional analyses and unsupervised methods to determine a biological signature behind pain heterogeneity in individuals with SCD. Our approach allows for comprehensive unbiased gene expression analyses, which overcomes inherent biases when measuring multiple select plasma mediators, and it captures combinatorial effects of protein and nonprotein mediators.\nOur findings suggest the induction of genes related to inflammatory pathways may collectively play a key role in the interindividual variability of SCD pain frequency. The GO term “inflammatory response” was the most significant biological process associated with pain frequency in our cohort. Other significant identified processes that contribute to enhanced inflammatory or immunoregulatory response include “cellular responses to lipopolysaccharide,” “positive regulation of chemokine production,” and “cytokine-mediated signaling pathway.” “Apoptotic processes,” also significantly represented by our data, are shown to contribute to the development of neuropathic pain and are often triggered by proinflammatory cytokines during cross talk with autophagic activities.\nThe role of immune mediators in SCD pain likely extends beyond vaso-occlusion. Chronic inflammation is a likely consequence of ongoing vaso-occlusion. However, the downstream effects of chronic inflammation on the neurobiology of pain is an active area of investigation in SCD pain– and non-SCD pain–related disorders,\nWe identified TNF as the top hub gene in our data, indicating it may be a potential therapeutic target for SCD pain. Although TNF inhibitors have not yet been investigated for individuals with SCD, a case report of an individual with SCD who received adalimumab (TNF inhibitor) for psoriasis described decreased SCD pain intensity after drug initiation, with pain resolution at week-17 follow-up.\nOther top hub genes we identified could be potential therapeutic SCD pain targets. CCL2, also called monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, has been described as an important contributor to chronic inflammation and neuropathic pain. It is shown to be elevated in SCD during and between crises.\nOur data support the discovery of potential novel pathways in the context of SCD pain. Some of the top 10 identified hub genes are known contributors to other painful and inflammatory conditions but have yet to be described in SCD pain. Integrin subunit αM and integrin subunit αX encode integrins that form leukocyte-specific complement receptors 3 and 4. These receptors are expressed on most white blood cells and contribute to adherence of neutrophils and monocytes to endothelial cells and phagocytosis of complement-coated particles.\nNotably, 2 distinct pain constructs exist, 1 is differences in the biology that underlies variability in pain frequency, and the other is individual variability in the experience and physiological determinants of pain that dictates pain severity and analgesic needs despite the same underlying pain biology. Our work investigates pathways that may contribute to pain biology that drives varied pain frequency. This work was not intended to investigate individual variability in the experience and physiological determinants of pain. Regardless, the terminal event of pain the individual experienced was severe enough to seek acute care and this drove our primary outcome. The biological etiology driving pain could be different than the sensation of pain and the biology that leads to this sensation. Everyone has variability in their pain experience that may or may not lead them to seek acute care for pain. We decided a priori that if an individual sought acute care for pain that their pain reached a sufficient threshold for needing intervention. Because our data support that the identified pathways are significantly associated with frequency of acute care use for pain, it may be possible that the biology is contributing to both the event and perception of pain. However, the answer to this question requires future work.\nOur study is limited by participants from multiple sites contributing data; it is possible that differences in sample collection and processing occurred despite directing sites to follow the same protocol. However, this limitation could also be considered a strength, thereby increasing generalizability of our findings because multisite data are more reflective of true participant heterogeneity, pain variability, and other factors that cannot be controlled. The use of acute care encounters to evaluate pain frequency likely underestimates the true frequency of pain episodes that an individual experiences because many with SCD manage their pain at home. However, this limitation does not invalidate our findings and would be problematic if acute care encounters overestimated the amount of pain. Study plasma samples were obtained from a biobank. Use of biobanked research samples is common and all sites were directed to use the same processing protocol and samples were preserved at −80°C. All samples were analyzed via a fresh thaw; the absence of prior freeze/thaw cycles sustained the quality/integrity of the samples and analyses. The 3-year period before blood collection used to define pain acute care encounters may not reflect the longitudinal pain experience and captures a snapshot in time for an individual and it is possible that those with no pain events minimized the differences that we may have found.\nIn conclusion, we identified distinct molecular expression profiles in individuals with SCD that are significantly associated with the frequency of pain. We also identified hub genes contained within these profiles that may be linked mechanistically to SCD pain and leveraged as potential therapeutic pain targets. Future work should focus on further validating this signature and investigating the potential targets uncovered for their mechanistic role in SCD pain. Future work will leverage these data to create a potential biomarker to differentiate pain phenotypes and prognosticate SCD severity that is rooted in the potential biological pathways associated with SCD pain.\nConflict-of-interest disclosure: A.M.B. is on an adjudication committee for a clinical trial sponsored by Pfizer (unrelated to the submitted research).

In this study, we sought to identify a biological signature, unique to individuals with SCD, that could differentiate between individuals with varied pain frequency.

Hydroxyurea use within prior 3 months was self-reported by the patient/family at the time of MAGiC trial enrollment. Proof of adherence, dose, and therapy duration were not assessed. Our phenotypic trait of interest, pain frequency, was defined as the total number of hospitalizations for an acute pain episode in the 3 years before plasma collection and was analyzed as a continuous variable.\nPlasma-induced transcriptional signature analyses were conducted as described previously.\nWe further filtered differentially expressed transcripts to create the gene input list for WGCNA using an intersection of 2 filtering methodologies. For the first method, we retained genes that were in the top 25% of transcripts meeting stated thresholds in both single and multiple center analyses. For the second method, we retained genes in the top 5000 transcripts with the highest median absolute deviation (MAD) in both analyses. Age and sex were investigated and were not found to contribute to the measured variance.

The primary clinical interventions include surgical tension-free suturing of the severed nerve ends and autologous nerve transplantation. Despite these interventions, patients often experience complications, and the outcomes are not entirely satisfactory for either patients or clinicians. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gradually become a novel therapeutic option, with burgeoning preclinical evidence elucidating their multimodal therapeutic potential in peripheral nerve reconstruction. This research has produced promising outcomes, contributing to both fundamental research and translational medicine.

Furthermore, MSCs have the potential to differentiate into myelin-forming cell lineages and Schwann-like cells, thereby contributing to nerve repair [\nStem cells can be categorized into totipotent, pluripotent, and monopotent types based on their differentiation potential, with MSCs falling under the classification of pluripotent stem cells. MSCs are a unique type of stem cell known for their capacity to self-renew, quickly multiply, and transform into various cell types. Because they can modulate the immune system, reduce inflammation, prevent apoptosis, and promote angiogenesis, they are well-suited for regenerative medicine [\nBone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs), umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), dental mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are among the most extensively researched and applied stem cell types. These cells, along with their derivatives—such as exosomes, mitochondria, secretomes, organoids, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and microRNAs—are illustrated in\nSeveral common MSC types (mainly BMSCs, ADSCs, UCMSCs, DMSCs, and iPSCs) and their derivatives (mainly exosomes, mitochondria, the secretome, organoids, ECM, and microRNAs) used to promote peripheral nerve regeneration.\nDerived from animal bone marrow, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are among the most thoroughly studied cell types in relation to peripheral nerve injury [\nIsolated from the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue, ADSCs are considered an excellent source of MSCs due to their high availability, easy accessibility, and powerful immunomodulatory functions. Notably, their therapeutic potential remains unaffected by the donor age or anatomical harvesting site while maintaining stable phenotypic characteristics and long-term plasticity\nDerived from the umbilical cords of newborns, UCMSCs provide a safe and easily obtainable source of stem cells with notable therapeutic benefits. Compared with MSCs derived from adult tissues, UCMSCs exhibit a superior proliferative capacity, enhanced differentiation potential, and more potent immunomodulatory properties [\nThrough various mechanisms such as paracrine effects, vascular and synaptic regeneration, immune system modulation, and apoptosis inhibition, DMSCs may be crucial in treating neurological conditions. The isolation of dental stem cells from the pulp of permanent teeth was first achieved by Gronthos in 2002, who named them dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), indicating that dental tissues could potentially be a source of stem cells. The taxonomic delineation of odontogenic stem cells is fundamentally contingent upon their distinctive anatomical derivation. The following subpopulations have been identified: DPSCs, periodontal stem cells (PDLSCs), deciduous stem cells (SHEDs), and gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs). Furthermore, they are capable of differentiating into various cell lineages, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, myoblasts, and neuronal cells, among others. DPSCs, PDLSCs, and SHEDs all originate in the neural crest, which is a significant distinction from the source of BMSCs, which originate from the mesoderm [\nCompared with the majority of MSCs, DMSCs derived from the neural crest display enhanced proliferative and neural differentiation capabilities, exhibit remarkable anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and can be harvested in a manner that circumvents invasive surgical procedures while facilitating expeditious gingival tissue healing without scarring. Despite their disparate origins, they all exhibit analogous properties, including self-renewal, multidirectional differentiation, immunomodulation, and the expression of MSC surface markers [\nEmerging experimental evidence reveals that GMSC-differentiated Schwann-like cells possess dual-functional characteristics encompassing neurotrophic support and macrophage polarization regulation. Mechanistically, these biological attributes demonstrate marked therapeutic efficacy in potentiating axonal regrowth and functional neural restoration in rodent sciatic nerve injury models [\niPSCs, formally defined as reprogrammed pluripotent stem cells, constitute a specialized class of pluripotent cells generated through defined transcriptional factor-mediated epigenetic reprogramming of terminally differentiated somatic cells, ultimately possessing molecular and functional equivalency to embryonic stem cells. This genetically engineered cell lineage demonstrates embryonic stem cell-equivalent totipotency through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic modification, exhibiting congruent molecular signatures in cellular morphology, transcriptional profiles, proteomic expression patterns, and multilineage differentiation capacity that meet stringent equivalence criteria to their embryonic counterparts, thereby achieving functional equivalency in regenerative therapeutic applications. Its potential applications are nearly identical to those of embryonic stem cells. iPSCs offer multiple advantages. Primarily, they can be derived from a wide range of sources and can be artificially synthesized without ethical constraints. Second, iPSCs exhibit a robust regenerative differentiation capacity, which provides a novel avenue for advancement in the broader field of stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine research [\nOncomodulin (OCM) is a myeloid-derived growth factor that has been reported to promote axon regeneration following optic nerve injury or peripheral nerve injury.

In-depth studies of the mechanisms of action, modulation of signaling pathways, and cell–cell interactions are needed. The challenges include resolving the quality control issues of transplanted cells, immune rejection, and ethical issues. In clinical translation, a greater need is to identify accurate molecular mechanisms and assess their efficacy. The mechanisms of action, signaling pathways, and advantages and disadvantages of different MSCs for the treatment of nerve injury are summarized in\nThe therapeutic utilization of common stem cell types for peripheral nerve regeneration requires systematic analysis through cellular origin, signaling axis, therapeutic merits/limitations, and molecular effector pathways\nGuo\nCombinatorial cellular therapy with autologous MSCs and Schwann cells demonstrated significant neurological recovery in 106 complete SCI patients during therapeutic intervention and follow-up monitoring.

Subjects exhibited statistically significant enhancements in sensorimotor domains. Furthermore, anal sphincter control improvements with enhanced deep pressure perception were documented across cohorts, correlating with enhanced QoL metrics. Significantly, two Group B participants achieved complete bladder autonomy, eliminating catheterization dependence [\nContemporary research establishes MSCs as mediating therapeutic outcomes through exosomal secretion. These nanoscale extracellular vesicles (30–150 nm diameter) feature a lipid bilayer envelope. Their biogenesis initiates with plasma membrane invagination forming early endosomes, progressing through endosomal sorting complex required for transport-mediated maturation where intraluminal vesicle budding occurs. Subsequent membrane fusion enables exocytic secretion of these vesicles. Crucially, exosomes transport diverse cargo including regulatory RNAs, functional proteins, lipid signaling molecules, and bioactive metabolites [\nExosomes derived from stem cells present several advantages over MSCs, including their smaller size, good biocompatibility, low toxicity, stability, and ability to act as molecular carriers. These vesicles mediate intercellular signaling and modulate tissue-level homeostatic regulation [\nStem cell-derived extracellular vesicles can directly act on neurons and axons at the injury site to promote peripheral nerve regeneration. Moreover, they can promote peripheral nerve regeneration by stimulating Schwann cells to dedifferentiate into repair-type Schwann cells, inducing angiogenesis, stimulating proinflammatory macrophages to transform into anti-inflammatory macrophages, alleviating NP, and ultimately restoring neural reinnervation of the target organ. The figure was drawn by the author\nThe most intuitive method for restoring nerve integrity is axonal growth, which represents the primary objective of numerous therapeutic strategies for nerve injury. Emerging research establishes MSC-derived exosomes as innovative nanovesicle-based gene delivery systems that activate nerve regeneration-related pathways and promote nerve regeneration through the delivery of microRNAs (miRs) to target cells, thereby regulating gene expression [\nPost-exosomal internalization, Schwann cells acquire augmented functional competence. Hu\nThe development of the nervous system is supported by the formation of blood vessels. In addition to supplying oxygen and nutrients to peripheral neurons, which require an energy source, blood vessels also function as active signaling systems [\nA number of recent studies have revealed that exosomes can act as regulatory substances to promote vascular regeneration. Gong\nMSCs possess robust immunomodulatory capabilities, and their secreted exosomes have been shown to exert similar effects. Following the onset of peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells phagocytose and remove myelin debris, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and recruit immune cells when Wallerian degeneration occurs. First, the earliest cells recruited to the site of injury are granulocytes and neutrophils, which can prevent secondary infections from bacteria and other microorganisms. Eosinophils may also participate in tissue repair processes, as they can release various mediators that contribute to tissue remodeling [\nNP arises from neural lesions or aberrant neural signaling, manifesting as chronic pain. Peripheral nerve trauma (PNI) inducing sensory fiber lesions triggers NP, substantially compromising patient quality of life metrics. At present, no specific pharmacological agent is capable of completely treating NP. Some studies have indicated the potential existence of an association between NP and low-grade inflammation [\nMitochondria serve as the principal intracellular organelles for cellular energy production. Their structural architecture features a double-membrane system organized into four distinct compartments: outer membrane, inner membrane, intermembrane space, and mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane is populated with a multitude of respiratory chain complexes, which are instrumental in the oxidative phosphorylation process and facilitate the conversion of nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), thereby supplying the cell with energy [\nIntercellular mitochondrial transfer from MSCs modulates key cellular functions in recipient cells, encompassing proliferation, migration, differentiation, metabolic reprogramming, and phenotypic plasticity. The main pathways for the mitochondrial transfer of MSCs include tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) (Cx43, GAP43, and Rho-GTPase Miro1-dependent pathways), extracellular vesicles (Rab7-GDP-dependent pathway), gap junctions, and cell fusion. Furthermore, cells are also capable of ingesting free mitochondria that have been released by MSCs [\nStem cell-derived mitochondria mediate neural regeneration via molecular mechanisms including mitochondrial transfer, transplantation, and immunomodulatory pathways. Mitochondrial transfer primarily operates through intercellular proximity, utilizing dual transfer modalities: TNTs (Cx43/GAP43/Rho-GTPase Miro1-regulated) and Rab7-GDP-mediated vesicular transport. Mitochondrial transfer enhances peripheral nerve repair via bioenergetic support, ferroptosis suppression, neovascularization induction, and homeostatic microenvironment modulation. Mitochondrial transplantation involves extracting exosomes from stem cells through artificial techniques. After identification and concentration, they can be used to target muscles or directly for nerves at the injury site. In terms of immune regulation, mitochondria can enter recipient cells through PRRs; mitochondria can also activate the innate immune response of cells by releasing mtDNA into the cytoplasm, increasing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and causing chronic inflammation and functional decline through different signaling pathways. In addition, adipose tissue at the site of nerve injury can act on Schwann cells by secreting leptin, thereby increasing the ATP content inside the cells to support regeneration damage-associated molecular patterns. The figure was drawn by the author\nAfter nerve injury, mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in neurons. Healthy mitochondria can be transported into damaged neurons by exogenous implantation strategies to help restore the energy balance, rescue mitochondrial dysfunction, and support cell survival. Kuo\nIntercellular mitochondrial dynamics and exogenous mitochondrial engraftment within peripheral neural regenerative paradigms. (\nPNI pathogenesis induces an inflammatory microenvironment that partially compromises neural repair mechanisms. Mitochondria play pivotal roles in the inflammatory response, regulating oxidative stress and apoptosis. Additionally, they serve as a source of energy for immune cells through oxidative phosphorylation [\nIn the context of injury, damaged mitochondria can release mtDNA, proteins, and other substances into the cytosol. These molecules function as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), eliciting innate immune activation through pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling. The release of mitochondrial DNA and reactive oxygen species can stimulate an immune response within the host cell, which, in turn, causes inflammation. Mitochondria orchestrate phagocytic and apoptotic mechanisms to mitigate DAMP generation while preserving organellar homeostasis and functionality [\nMitochondrial dysfunction triggers cytoplasmic/extracellular compartmentalization of organellar components and byproducts, inducing inflammatory cascades. The cGAS-STING1 axis operates as the core regulatory hub for mitochondria-driven inflammation while concurrently serving as a central contributor to age-related chronic inflammation and physiological deterioration. Apoptotic and autophagic pathways constitute essential regulatory mechanisms in mitigating mitochondrial inflammatory pathogenesis [\nMitochondrial autophagy represents an intracellular protective mechanism for the removal of damaged or abnormally functioning mitochondria. This process maintains mitochondrial quality and function and, in tissues, prevents excessive inflammatory responses, which can be exacerbated when mitochondrial autophagy is impaired [\nWhile mitochondria are recognized as significant regulators of inflammation, additional research is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Although a substantial body of evidence linking inflammatory responses driven by mitochondrial dysfunction to disease exists, a clear mechanistic understanding is lacking [\nMesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium (MSC-CM)—comprising the MSC secretome—is enriched with bioactive molecules (e.g. cytokines and growth factors) released by MSCs. Notably, MSC-CM has emerged as a pivotal cell-free therapeutic modality in neuroregeneration, circumventing tumorigenic risks, immunological rejection, and ethical constraints inherent to MSC transplantation. Proteomic profiling of diverse MSC lineages identified secretomes abundant in neurotrophic factors—VEGF, IGF, PDGF, and HGF—and anti-inflammatory cytokines [\nIn peripheral nerve injury, the application of MSC-CM may act through neurotrophic factors to reduce cell death in neurons and satellite cells [\nThe secretome of DMSCs provides superior neuroprotection. DMSCs exhibit neurotrophic superiority over BMSCs and ADSCs through trophic factor enrichment. DMSCs orchestrate Schwann cell mitogenesis, chemotaxis, and lineage commitment via cytokines (IGF-1/BDNF), while PDGF/TGF-β signaling drives concurrent neurovascular regeneration. Collectively, DMSC-CM establishes a neuroprotective niche supporting axogenesis, myelin reformation, metabolic homeostasis, and antiapoptotic effects [\nThe secretome encompasses all cellularly secreted proteins into the extracellular milieu, comprising paracrine factors, microbubbles, and exosomes. Exosomes constitute a key constituent of this secretory repertoire. The role of exosomes is as described above, whereas the secretome, as a mixture, exerts a broader neuroregenerative effect.\nOrganoids are tissue analogs with a specific three-dimensional structure that are formed using adult stem cells or pluripotent stem cells in three-dimensional culture\nVan Lent\nThe manipulation of the ECM and gene regulation are highly important in the construction of organoids. Stem cell-derived organoids display the characteristics of the organ of origin, including cell types, functions, and tissue spatial structures. Furthermore, microfluidic systems, endothelial cell coverage modules, and vascular endothelial growth factor delivery systems have been shown to be effective in promoting the formation of blood vessels, thereby facilitating the transport of oxygen or nutrients to the interior of organoids. The study of organoids has evolved significantly over time, progressing from planar cell culture to 3D structured tissue culture and beyond. ECM research has been a key area of development, as has the creation of vascularization techniques and spatiotemporal regulation of signaling pathways [\nGuo\nNMJ formation between human fetal spinal stem cell-derived motoneurons and skeletal muscle stem cell-generated myofibers. (\nFor large segmental nerve defects, autologous nerve grafts remain the clinical gold standard. However, limitations persist with this method, prompting the development of tissue-engineered nerve grafts as emerging viable alternatives. From a bionics perspective, nerve grafts based on the ECM have unparalleled advantages over other synthetic grafts.\nThe ECM—a cell-secreted network extracellularly deposited in tissues—comprises two molecular classes: fibrous proteins (collagen, elastin) and glycoproteins (fibronectin, proteoglycans, and laminin) [\nSchematic of key ECM constituents: fibronectin, collagen, integrin, glycosaminoglycan, proteoglycans, and laminin, functioning as a tissue engineering scaffold. The figure was drawn by the author\nWith respect to tissue-derived ECM, research on decellularized porcine neurogenic ECM is more prevalent. This approach is employed to create hydrogels that are used to fill the gaps in nerves and enhance nerve regeneration. Previous research by our group has shown that the treatment of porcine peripheral nerves using supercritical extraction composite technology to maximize the removal of DNA and fat from NGs can facilitate enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation, thereby rendering it a decellularization method with considerable clinical applicability [\nCell-derived and multiple forms of tissue-derived ECM promote peripheral nerve regeneration. (\nThe ECM serves as neural conduits/graft scaffolds to modulate regenerative microenvironments during neural repair [\nAs previously stated, microRNAs (miRs) may be responsible for modulating the relevant regenerative signaling pathways in peripheral nerve regeneration therapy using MSCs. miRs are endogenous noncoding RNAs (~22 nt) mediating posttranscriptional regulation in organisms. Multiple miRs critically regulate post-injury nerve regeneration. Transcriptomics identified upregulated miR-21/132/29a/29b post-sciatic injury, modulating stress responses and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Upstream regulators (miRs, including let-7, miR-21 and miR-223) correlate with PNI-induced transcriptional dysregulation, demonstrating essential roles in peripheral nerve repair [\nThe involvement of miRs in myelin formation and synaptic plasticity has been documented. Ma\nmiRs critically regulate immune function and neuronal differentiation. Wang\nThe involvement of microRNAs (miRs) in myelin formation and nerve regeneration has been documented, and miRs can exert their regulatory functions by acting on Schwann cells. miR-21 overexpression downregulates PTEN and activates PI3K, driving Schwann cell phenotypic reprogramming to enhance axonal regeneration and post-injury functional recovery [\nNotably, the lifespan of miRs is relatively short, which may limit their continuous effects during treatment. However, through an appropriate carrier or drug delivery system, the duration of their effects can be prolonged to a certain extent, and their effectiveness in PNR can be improved [\nWhether derivatives synergistically promote nerve regeneration when used in combination is a question worth pondering. MSCs exert different effects under different conditions, and manual intervention, such as the simultaneous extraction of mitochondria and exosomes from MSCs, may be required if combination therapy is needed.\nECM and secretome collaboratively establish a pro-regenerative microenvironment. Secretome-derived growth factors/cytokines modulate ECM biosynthesis/secretion, while ECM reciprocally adsorbs/enriches the secretome’s bioactive molecules, creating localized high-concentration niches [\nMitochondria-secretome interplay sustains neuronal energy/functional support. Secretome-derived IGF-1 enhances mitochondrial internalization within neuronal populations, while mitochondria provide ATP to neuronal cells to maintain their energy requirements during regeneration [\nmiRs and exosomes cooperate to regulate gene expression in neuronal cells at the posttranscriptional level [\nMulticomponent synergy (MSC-exosomes/secretome/mitochondria/ECM/miRs derivatives) potentiates neural regeneration via establishing regenerative niches, sustaining neuronal homeostasis, and epigenetic modulation. While preclinical evidence demonstrates efficacy, clinical translation requires validation of these combinatorial mechanisms.\nStem cell transplantation emerges as a promising therapeutic strategy, with clinical trials demonstrating early-phase benefits in patient cohorts. Current studies indicate MSC derivatives (exosomes/mitochondria/ECM) elicit comparable therapeutic efficacy to parental MSCs. However, the current theories and techniques regarding cell therapy application and clinical translation have not yet fully matured, which has become an obstacle to the clinical translation of MSCs and their derivative therapies. Thus, MSC and derivative developmental trajectories center on these key aspects: (i) In-depth research must be conducted and standardized protocols optimized. Innovative extraction and purification techniques are needed. In the future, a pressing need is to develop more efficient and precise extraction and purification methods for MSCs and their derivatives. (ii) Research on cellular and molecular mechanisms is needed. Further exploration of the interactions between MSCs and their derivatives and the immune and vascular systems during neural regeneration is necessary. (iii) Exploring and implementing combined therapeutic strategies is a third approach. Synergistic therapeutic regimens for MSCs and other cells (e.g. neural stem cells and Schwann cells) or biologically active factors, along with rational combinations of MSCs with other cells with the potential to repair nerves (such as neural stem cells and Schwann cells) or biologically active factors, can achieve synergistic effects. (iv) These treatments should be integrated organically with traditional therapies. The modes of combined application of MSCs and their derivative treatments with surgical, physical, and pharmacological therapies and other traditional treatment modalities should be explored. Simultaneously, formulating clinical application guidelines is necessary to clarify issues such as cell sources, preparation processes, administration routes and dosages, and treatment timing.", "content_for_embedding": "Compared with other mesenchymal stem cells, dental mesenchymal stem cells originating from the neural crest have strong neurogenic and immunoregulatory abilities, thus showing promising application and transformation prospects in the field of PNI repair.\nExosomes play important roles in the repair process of PNI by activating Schwann cells, regulating neuroinflammation, promoting angiogenesis and axonal regeneration, and ameliorating neuropathic pain.\nDuring the PNI repair process, mitochondria transferred\nCell-derived and tissue-derived extracellular matrices (ECMs) can provide scaffolds for peripheral nerve tissue engineering, and cell-derived ECMs show great potential for clinical translation.\nPeripheral nerve injury (PNI)—induced by mechanical trauma or compressive forces—may precipitate varying degrees of sensorimotor deficits, with clinical manifestations ranging from transient neuralgia to irreversible neuromuscular impairment mediated through Wallerian degeneration pathways [\nMSCs demonstrate neuroregenerative potential through paracrine secretion of neurotrophins (e.g. brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF)) during peripheral nerve repair processes, establishing chemotactic gradients that guide axonal sprouting and elongation. Furthermore, MSCs have the potential to differentiate into myelin-forming cell lineages and Schwann-like cells, thereby contributing to nerve repair [\nStem cells can be categorized into totipotent, pluripotent, and monopotent types based on their differentiation potential, with MSCs falling under the classification of pluripotent stem cells. MSCs are a unique type of stem cell known for their capacity to self-renew, quickly multiply, and transform into various cell types. Because they can modulate the immune system, reduce inflammation, prevent apoptosis, and promote angiogenesis, they are well-suited for regenerative medicine [\nBone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs), umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), dental mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are among the most extensively researched and applied stem cell types. These cells, along with their derivatives—such as exosomes, mitochondria, secretomes, organoids, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and microRNAs—are illustrated in\nSeveral common MSC types (mainly BMSCs, ADSCs, UCMSCs, DMSCs, and iPSCs) and their derivatives (mainly exosomes, mitochondria, the secretome, organoids, ECM, and microRNAs) used to promote peripheral nerve regeneration.\nDerived from animal bone marrow, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are among the most thoroughly studied cell types in relation to peripheral nerve injury [\nIsolated from the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue, ADSCs are considered an excellent source of MSCs due to their high availability, easy accessibility, and powerful immunomodulatory functions. Notably, their therapeutic potential remains unaffected by the donor age or anatomical harvesting site while maintaining stable phenotypic characteristics and long-term plasticity\nDerived from the umbilical cords of newborns, UCMSCs provide a safe and easily obtainable source of stem cells with notable therapeutic benefits. Compared with MSCs derived from adult tissues, UCMSCs exhibit a superior proliferative capacity, enhanced differentiation potential, and more potent immunomodulatory properties [\nThrough various mechanisms such as paracrine effects, vascular and synaptic regeneration, immune system modulation, and apoptosis inhibition, DMSCs may be crucial in treating neurological conditions. The isolation of dental stem cells from the pulp of permanent teeth was first achieved by Gronthos in 2002, who named them dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), indicating that dental tissues could potentially be a source of stem cells. The taxonomic delineation of odontogenic stem cells is fundamentally contingent upon their distinctive anatomical derivation. The following subpopulations have been identified: DPSCs, periodontal stem cells (PDLSCs), deciduous stem cells (SHEDs), and gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs). Furthermore, they are capable of differentiating into various cell lineages, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, myoblasts, and neuronal cells, among others. DPSCs, PDLSCs, and SHEDs all originate in the neural crest, which is a significant distinction from the source of BMSCs, which originate from the mesoderm [\nCompared with the majority of MSCs, DMSCs derived from the neural crest display enhanced proliferative and neural differentiation capabilities, exhibit remarkable anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and can be harvested in a manner that circumvents invasive surgical procedures while facilitating expeditious gingival tissue healing without scarring. Despite their disparate origins, they all exhibit analogous properties, including self-renewal, multidirectional differentiation, immunomodulation, and the expression of MSC surface markers [\nEmerging experimental evidence reveals that GMSC-differentiated Schwann-like cells possess dual-functional characteristics encompassing neurotrophic support and macrophage polarization regulation. Mechanistically, these biological attributes demonstrate marked therapeutic efficacy in potentiating axonal regrowth and functional neural restoration in rodent sciatic nerve injury models [\niPSCs, formally defined as reprogrammed pluripotent stem cells, constitute a specialized class of pluripotent cells generated through defined transcriptional factor-mediated epigenetic reprogramming of terminally differentiated somatic cells, ultimately possessing molecular and functional equivalency to embryonic stem cells. This genetically engineered cell lineage demonstrates embryonic stem cell-equivalent totipotency through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic modification, exhibiting congruent molecular signatures in cellular morphology, transcriptional profiles, proteomic expression patterns, and multilineage differentiation capacity that meet stringent equivalence criteria to their embryonic counterparts, thereby achieving functional equivalency in regenerative therapeutic applications. Its potential applications are nearly identical to those of embryonic stem cells. iPSCs offer multiple advantages. Primarily, they can be derived from a wide range of sources and can be artificially synthesized without ethical constraints. Second, iPSCs exhibit a robust regenerative differentiation capacity, which provides a novel avenue for advancement in the broader field of stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine research [\nOncomodulin (OCM) is a myeloid-derived growth factor that has been reported to promote axon regeneration following optic nerve injury or peripheral nerve injury. Xie\nThe choice of cell type as well as the mode and quantity of cell transplant delivery will affect the final therapeutic effect. In-depth studies of the mechanisms of action, modulation of signaling pathways, and cell–cell interactions are needed. The challenges include resolving the quality control issues of transplanted cells, immune rejection, and ethical issues. In clinical translation, a greater need is to identify accurate molecular mechanisms and assess their efficacy. The mechanisms of action, signaling pathways, and advantages and disadvantages of different MSCs for the treatment of nerve injury are summarized in\nThe therapeutic utilization of common stem cell types for peripheral nerve regeneration requires systematic analysis through cellular origin, signaling axis, therapeutic merits/limitations, and molecular effector pathways\nGuo\nCombinatorial cellular therapy with autologous MSCs and Schwann cells demonstrated significant neurological recovery in 106 complete SCI patients during therapeutic intervention and follow-up monitoring. Targeted intrathecal delivery of BMSC-SC combinations enhanced urodynamic metrics while reducing urinary incontinence incidence and elevating quality of life (QoL) parameters in neurogenic bladder cases [\nThe clinical trial demonstrated favorable safety profiles for both MSC variants. Subjects exhibited statistically significant enhancements in sensorimotor domains. Furthermore, anal sphincter control improvements with enhanced deep pressure perception were documented across cohorts, correlating with enhanced QoL metrics. Significantly, two Group B participants achieved complete bladder autonomy, eliminating catheterization dependence [\nContemporary research establishes MSCs as mediating therapeutic outcomes through exosomal secretion. These nanoscale extracellular vesicles (30–150 nm diameter) feature a lipid bilayer envelope. Their biogenesis initiates with plasma membrane invagination forming early endosomes, progressing through endosomal sorting complex required for transport-mediated maturation where intraluminal vesicle budding occurs. Subsequent membrane fusion enables exocytic secretion of these vesicles. Crucially, exosomes transport diverse cargo including regulatory RNAs, functional proteins, lipid signaling molecules, and bioactive metabolites [\nExosomes derived from stem cells present several advantages over MSCs, including their smaller size, good biocompatibility, low toxicity, stability, and ability to act as molecular carriers. These vesicles mediate intercellular signaling and modulate tissue-level homeostatic regulation [\nStem cell-derived extracellular vesicles can directly act on neurons and axons at the injury site to promote peripheral nerve regeneration. Moreover, they can promote peripheral nerve regeneration by stimulating Schwann cells to dedifferentiate into repair-type Schwann cells, inducing angiogenesis, stimulating proinflammatory macrophages to transform into anti-inflammatory macrophages, alleviating NP, and ultimately restoring neural reinnervation of the target organ. The figure was drawn by the author\nThe most intuitive method for restoring nerve integrity is axonal growth, which represents the primary objective of numerous therapeutic strategies for nerve injury. Emerging research establishes MSC-derived exosomes as innovative nanovesicle-based gene delivery systems that activate nerve regeneration-related pathways and promote nerve regeneration through the delivery of microRNAs (miRs) to target cells, thereby regulating gene expression [\nPost-exosomal internalization, Schwann cells acquire augmented functional competence. Hu\nThe development of the nervous system is supported by the formation of blood vessels. In addition to supplying oxygen and nutrients to peripheral neurons, which require an energy source, blood vessels also function as active signaling systems [\nA number of recent studies have revealed that exosomes can act as regulatory substances to promote vascular regeneration. Gong\nMSCs possess robust immunomodulatory capabilities, and their secreted exosomes have been shown to exert similar effects. Following the onset of peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells phagocytose and remove myelin debris, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and recruit immune cells when Wallerian degeneration occurs. First, the earliest cells recruited to the site of injury are granulocytes and neutrophils, which can prevent secondary infections from bacteria and other microorganisms. Eosinophils may also participate in tissue repair processes, as they can release various mediators that contribute to tissue remodeling [\nNP arises from neural lesions or aberrant neural signaling, manifesting as chronic pain. Peripheral nerve trauma (PNI) inducing sensory fiber lesions triggers NP, substantially compromising patient quality of life metrics. At present, no specific pharmacological agent is capable of completely treating NP. Some studies have indicated the potential existence of an association between NP and low-grade inflammation [\nMitochondria serve as the principal intracellular organelles for cellular energy production. Their structural architecture features a double-membrane system organized into four distinct compartments: outer membrane, inner membrane, intermembrane space, and mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane is populated with a multitude of respiratory chain complexes, which are instrumental in the oxidative phosphorylation process and facilitate the conversion of nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), thereby supplying the cell with energy [\nIntercellular mitochondrial transfer from MSCs modulates key cellular functions in recipient cells, encompassing proliferation, migration, differentiation, metabolic reprogramming, and phenotypic plasticity. The main pathways for the mitochondrial transfer of MSCs include tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) (Cx43, GAP43, and Rho-GTPase Miro1-dependent pathways), extracellular vesicles (Rab7-GDP-dependent pathway), gap junctions, and cell fusion. Furthermore, cells are also capable of ingesting free mitochondria that have been released by MSCs [\nStem cell-derived mitochondria mediate neural regeneration via molecular mechanisms including mitochondrial transfer, transplantation, and immunomodulatory pathways. Mitochondrial transfer primarily operates through intercellular proximity, utilizing dual transfer modalities: TNTs (Cx43/GAP43/Rho-GTPase Miro1-regulated) and Rab7-GDP-mediated vesicular transport. Mitochondrial transfer enhances peripheral nerve repair via bioenergetic support, ferroptosis suppression, neovascularization induction, and homeostatic microenvironment modulation. Mitochondrial transplantation involves extracting exosomes from stem cells through artificial techniques. After identification and concentration, they can be used to target muscles or directly for nerves at the injury site. In terms of immune regulation, mitochondria can enter recipient cells through PRRs; mitochondria can also activate the innate immune response of cells by releasing mtDNA into the cytoplasm, increasing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and causing chronic inflammation and functional decline through different signaling pathways. In addition, adipose tissue at the site of nerve injury can act on Schwann cells by secreting leptin, thereby increasing the ATP content inside the cells to support regeneration damage-associated molecular patterns. The figure was drawn by the author\nAfter nerve injury, mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in neurons. Healthy mitochondria can be transported into damaged neurons by exogenous implantation strategies to help restore the energy balance, rescue mitochondrial dysfunction, and support cell survival. Kuo\nIntercellular mitochondrial dynamics and exogenous mitochondrial engraftment within peripheral neural regenerative paradigms. (\nPNI pathogenesis induces an inflammatory microenvironment that partially compromises neural repair mechanisms. Mitochondria play pivotal roles in the inflammatory response, regulating oxidative stress and apoptosis. Additionally, they serve as a source of energy for immune cells through oxidative phosphorylation [\nIn the context of injury, damaged mitochondria can release mtDNA, proteins, and other substances into the cytosol. These molecules function as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), eliciting innate immune activation through pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling. The release of mitochondrial DNA and reactive oxygen species can stimulate an immune response within the host cell, which, in turn, causes inflammation. Mitochondria orchestrate phagocytic and apoptotic mechanisms to mitigate DAMP generation while preserving organellar homeostasis and functionality [\nMitochondrial dysfunction triggers cytoplasmic/extracellular compartmentalization of organellar components and byproducts, inducing inflammatory cascades. The cGAS-STING1 axis operates as the core regulatory hub for mitochondria-driven inflammation while concurrently serving as a central contributor to age-related chronic inflammation and physiological deterioration. Apoptotic and autophagic pathways constitute essential regulatory mechanisms in mitigating mitochondrial inflammatory pathogenesis [\nMitochondrial autophagy represents an intracellular protective mechanism for the removal of damaged or abnormally functioning mitochondria. This process maintains mitochondrial quality and function and, in tissues, prevents excessive inflammatory responses, which can be exacerbated when mitochondrial autophagy is impaired [\nWhile mitochondria are recognized as significant regulators of inflammation, additional research is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Although a substantial body of evidence linking inflammatory responses driven by mitochondrial dysfunction to disease exists, a clear mechanistic understanding is lacking [\nMesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium (MSC-CM)—comprising the MSC secretome—is enriched with bioactive molecules (e.g. cytokines and growth factors) released by MSCs. Notably, MSC-CM has emerged as a pivotal cell-free therapeutic modality in neuroregeneration, circumventing tumorigenic risks, immunological rejection, and ethical constraints inherent to MSC transplantation. Proteomic profiling of diverse MSC lineages identified secretomes abundant in neurotrophic factors—VEGF, IGF, PDGF, and HGF—and anti-inflammatory cytokines [\nIn peripheral nerve injury, the application of MSC-CM may act through neurotrophic factors to reduce cell death in neurons and satellite cells [\nThe secretome of DMSCs provides superior neuroprotection. DMSCs exhibit neurotrophic superiority over BMSCs and ADSCs through trophic factor enrichment. DMSCs orchestrate Schwann cell mitogenesis, chemotaxis, and lineage commitment via cytokines (IGF-1/BDNF), while PDGF/TGF-β signaling drives concurrent neurovascular regeneration. Collectively, DMSC-CM establishes a neuroprotective niche supporting axogenesis, myelin reformation, metabolic homeostasis, and antiapoptotic effects [\nThe secretome encompasses all cellularly secreted proteins into the extracellular milieu, comprising paracrine factors, microbubbles, and exosomes. Exosomes constitute a key constituent of this secretory repertoire. The role of exosomes is as described above, whereas the secretome, as a mixture, exerts a broader neuroregenerative effect.\nOrganoids are tissue analogs with a specific three-dimensional structure that are formed using adult stem cells or pluripotent stem cells in three-dimensional culture\nVan Lent\nThe manipulation of the ECM and gene regulation are highly important in the construction of organoids. Stem cell-derived organoids display the characteristics of the organ of origin, including cell types, functions, and tissue spatial structures.

Acting as a partial agonist at the cannabinoid type 1 (CB\nHistorically, Δ9-THC was regarded as the primary driver of the behavioral and psychoactive effects of cannabis, with other chemical constituents considered to be largely inconsequential. As a result, early research predominantly focused on Δ9-THC due to its psychoactive properties, while research on other phytocannabinoids (e.g., cannabinol [CBN], cannabigerol [CBG]) and terpenes (e.g., d-limonene, β-myrcene, α-pinene) commonly found in the cannabis plant has been far more limited [\nThe entourage effect theory has influenced how cannabis products are cultivated, marketed, and consumed. For example, cannabis plants are being selectively bred to have specific cannabinoid and terpene profiles, driven by the belief that certain ratios of these compounds produce specific desired effects for the user [\nIn vitro receptor binding studies have shown mixed results, perhaps due to different methodological approaches, but there is evidence that some terpenes commonly found in cannabis have a CB\nα-Pinene, one of the most abundant terpenes found in cannabis and various other plant species, has gained interest due to its purported neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing properties [\nIn contrast to the cognitive-enhancing properties of α-pinene, Δ9-THC is well-documented for its acute deleterious effects on memory, particularly short-term and working memory impairments [\nThe present study utilized a double-blind, within-subjects crossover design. All participants completed a total of six outpatient drug administration sessions during which they inhaled α-pinene alone (15 mg), Δ9-THC alone (30 mg), Δ9-THC and α-pinene together (30 mg Δ9-THC + 0.5 mg α-pinene; 30 mg Δ9-THC + 5 mg α-pinene; 30 mg Δ9-THC + 15 mg α-pinene), or placebo (ambient air). The six experimental sessions were completed in a randomized order to minimize possible order effects and reduce bias [\nParticipants were recruited via internet advertisements and word-of-mouth communication. Interested individuals first completed a telephone or web-based screening questionnaire. Those who were eligible based on the initial screening were invited for an in-person evaluation consisting of written informed consent followed by a detailed medical history review and physical examination. A blood sample was taken for clinical chemistry testing and pregnancy testing for female volunteers, a urine sample was taken to test for recent illicit drug use (i.e., methamphetamine, PCP, cocaine, MDMA, oxycodone, morphine, amphetamine, methadone, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, buprenorphine, and Δ9-THC), a breath sample was taken to test for recent alcohol use, and the Timeline Follow-Back was used to assess non-medicinal drug and alcohol use over the past 90 days [\nStudy inclusion criteria were: (1) aged 18–55; (2) good health status as determined by in-person screening (e.g., medical exam, vital signs, blood clinical chemistry); (3) tested negative for drugs of misuse other than cannabis at screening and prior to each study visit; (4) not pregnant or breastfeeding; (5) body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 36 kg/m\nParticipants that met the above criteria were occasional cannabis smokers and were scheduled to complete the 6 drug exposure sessions. Upon arrival for each session, participants provided a urine sample to test for pregnancy/recent drug use, completed an alcohol breathalyzer, and self-reported their use of drugs/alcohol since their last visit via the Timeline Follow-Back (sessions were not conducted if the participant tested positive for pregnancy, alcohol use, or use of drugs aside from cannabis). Next, participants received a standard low-fat breakfast of toast and jam followed by baseline assessments of subjective effects, cognitive performance, and vital signs.\nAfter baseline assessments, participants were taken to a ventilated negative pressure chamber for drug self-administration under staff supervision. Participants inhaled either placebo (ambient air), α-pinene, Δ9-THC, or a combination of Δ9-THC and α-pinene using the Mighty Medic hand-held vaporizer (Storz and Bickel\nAll study drugs were prepared and dispensed by the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit (BPRU) Pharmacy. Synthetic Δ9-THC (>99% purity) was obtained from Δ9-THC Pharm GmbH (Frankfurt Am Main, Germany) and was dissolved in pharmacy-grade ethanol (190 proof; Spectrum Chemical, Gardena, CA, USA) to create a solution that was approximately 10% Δ9-THC/90% ethanol. Botanically derived α-pinene (>99% purity) was obtained from True Terpenes (Hillsboro, OR, USA). Prior to each experimental session, a pharmacist applied a precise amount of α-pinene and/or Δ9-THC using a micropipette to a steel wool dosing pad, which fit into a small dosing capsule (or “pod”) that was placed inside a hand-held vaporizer (Mighty Medic, Storz & Bickel, GmbH). Dosing pods containing Δ9-THC were kept out of the dosing chamber for approximately 30 min to allow the ethanol to dissipate prior to loading into the vaporizer.\nBecause there was no published safety or efficacy data related to the direct inhalation of α-pinene at the outset of the experiment, we conducted testing to ensure that α-pinene was effectively vaporized and not chemically altered by the vaporization process (GC/MS analysis of multiple test doses captured by a carbon filter). Doses of α-pinene were selected based on chemical analysis of 107 samples of cannabis, representing 29 unique cannabis cultivars, being sold by a licensed medical cannabis producer in Canada. Specifically, the two lower doses of α-pinene used in this study (0.5 mg and 5 mg) reflect the mean and max α-pinene doses contained in 1 g of cannabis flower based on the analyses of those cannabis samples. One gram is the amount of plant material commonly used to make a single cannabis cigarette (“pre-roll,” “joint,” or “blunt”). In addition to the 0.5 mg and 5 mg α-pinene doses, a 15 mg α-pinene dose was added into the study after pilot testing demonstrated safety at the two lower doses and a lack of overt impact of those doses on acute Δ9-THC exposure. Thus, doses used in this study were ecologically relevant and pilot testing demonstrated safety with respect to acute dosing via direct inhalation.\nSubjective drug effects, subjective ratings of mood, vital signs, and cognitive performance were assessed at baseline, immediately following drug exposure (i.e., time “0”), and 0.25, 0.5. 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h after drug exposure.

Change from baseline and peak change from baseline scores were calculated for subjective effects, cognitive performance, and vital signs. Change from baseline scores for each outcome were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the within subject factors of dose (placebo, 15 mg α-pinene, 30 mg Δ9-THC, 30 mg Δ9-THC + 0.5 mg α-pinene, 30 mg Δ9-THC + 5 mg α-pinene, 30 mg Δ9-THC + 15 mg α-pinene) and time (each post-dose assessment) (see online suppl.

Of those randomized, 19 (10 males, 8 females, and 1 non-binary individual) completed all six study conditions and were included in data analyses. Of the 14 who were excluded from data analyses, six participants completed pilot testing for initial safety and did not receive all final dose conditions), two participants were discontinued due to adverse effects associated with the study drug (both after 30 mg Δ9-THC + 15 mg α-pinene), four were lost to follow-up during study participation, one was discontinued due to reporting anxiety prior to dosing upon arrival for the 2nd study session, and one was discontinued due to failure to perform adequately on cognitive tests at baseline after repeated task instruction.\nThe racial/ethnic breakdown of the final study sample (\nMean topography values by THC dose\nIPI, Inter-puff interval.\nOutcomes of interest for subjective drug effects related to memory impairment included the DEQ item “trouble with memory” and the POMS domain “confusion/bewilderment.” Planned comparisons revealed a significant difference in peak-change from baseline scores between the placebo and Δ9-THC alone conditions for both items but did not detect any significant differences between the placebo and α-pinene conditions or the Δ9-THC alone and Δ9-THC + α-pinene combination conditions (see\nTime course for mean (SEM) subjective ratings of the Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ) item “Trouble with Memory” and Profile of Mood States (POMS) item “Confusion/Bewilderment”.

Gray bars indicate conditions with active THC administration.\nIn addition to these two items, planned comparisons revealed a significant difference in peak change from baseline scores between the placebo and Δ9-THC-alone conditions for 10 DEQ items, which included drug effect, pleasant drug effect, drug liking, heart racing, paranoia, sleepiness, increased appetite, dry mouth, dry eyes, and throat irritation (see online suppl. Table 1 for repeated-measures ANOVA results, which determined the planned comparisons conducted). However, no significant differences were observed on any additional POMS domains. Further, there were no differences between the placebo and α-pinene alone conditions or the Δ9-THC alone and Δ9-THC + α-pinene combination conditions for any of these variables (see\nOutcomes of interest for cognitive performance included ISLT retrieval and encoding, PASAT total number of correct trials, and DSST total number of correct trials.

Gray bars indicate conditions with active THC administration.\nIn total, there were 12 AEs spontaneously reported by participants in the study, none of which were considered unanticipated or serious. Participants experienced dizziness/lightheadedness (7 instances; three in the 30 mg Δ9-THC condition, two in the 30 mg Δ9-THC + 15 mg α-pinene condition, one in the 30 mg Δ9-THC + 5 mg α-pinene, and one in the 30 mg Δ9-THC + 0.5 mg α-pinene) and/or anxiety-like effects (7 instances; three in the 30 mg Δ9-THC condition, two in the 30 mg Δ9-THC + 15 mg α-pinene condition, one in the 30 mg Δ9-THC + 5 mg α-pinene, and one in the 30 mg Δ9-THC + 0.5 mg α-pinene). Two participants were withdrawn from the study due to AEs; one who experienced dizziness, shallow breath, and sedation following drug administration and the other who experienced dizziness, nausea, and emesis following drug administration (both in the 30 mg Δ9-THC + 15 mg α-pinene condition).\nDespite the widespread popularization of the “entourage effect” theory, little controlled clinical research has systematically evaluated the interactions between Δ9-THC and the specific terpenes frequently highlighted in cannabis industry marketing and product labeling. Results from this study showed that Δ9-THC alone induced cognitive and memory impairments compared to placebo, consistent with previous literature [\nThe null findings from the co-administration of α-pinene and Δ9-THC in this study have important implications for cannabis products, including their marketing (i.e., advertising of terpene profile), and formulation and usage recommendations. Notably, the doses of α-pinene tested in this study ranged from amounts that would be expected to be found in retail cannabis flower to amounts far exceeding those found in retail cannabis flower [\nThere are several limitations of the present study’s design that are important to consider in light of the observed null findings. First, this study used pure Δ9-THC and α-pinene rather than whole-plant cannabis, which often contains varying concentrations of additional terpenes and minor cannabinoids beyond α-pinene. It is possible that α-pinene alone may not exert significant effects in isolation but may instead contribute to synergistic interactions within whole-plant or “full-spectrum” cannabis products [\nIn summary, the present controlled human laboratory study was the first to examine whether the cannabis terpene α-pinene attenuated Δ9-THC-induced cognitive impairment in a dose-orderly fashion. Although Δ9-THC alone demonstrated cognitive impairments compared to placebo, these findings indicate that α-pinene did not mitigate Δ9-THC-induced cognitive impairments or influence other common acute subjective, cognitive, or physiological effects of Δ9-THC in this sample of healthy adult occasional cannabis users. Moreover, when inhaled alone, α-pinene did not produce any acute effects that differed from placebo, but this study did establish the safety of direct acute inhalation of α-pinene doses up to 15 mg in healthy adults using a vaporizer. Future research is needed to evaluate the modulatory effects of α-pinene under conditions that explore its interactions with other naturally occurring cannabis constituents, assess alternative methods of administration, include diverse user groups (e.g., regular users, abstinent individuals, users of synthetic cannabis or CBD), and incorporates more naturalistic use behavior (e.g., without masking exhaled vapor). Although α-pinene did not attenuate Δ9-THC-induced cognitive impairments in this study, the findings highlight the importance of using a controlled, dose-ranging approach to systematically assess entourage effects. By varying Δ9-THC and terpene exposure and examining their interaction on validated pharmacodynamic outcomes, this methodology provides a model for future research into Δ9-THC-terpene combinations and their potential therapeutic applications. As the use of cannabis expands for both medicinal and non-medicinal purposes, a deeper understanding of how individual cannabis constituents influence Δ9-THC’s effects – either by enhancing its safety profile (e.g., reducing acute cognitive and memory impairments), exacerbating adverse effects, or having no effect – is important for advancing the development of cannabinoids in medicine and protecting public health.\nWe thank the research, medical, nursing, and pharmacy support staff of the Johns Hopkins University Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit.

Acting as a partial agonist at the cannabinoid type 1 (CB\nHistorically, Δ9-THC was regarded as the primary driver of the behavioral and psychoactive effects of cannabis, with other chemical constituents considered to be largely inconsequential. As a result, early research predominantly focused on Δ9-THC due to its psychoactive properties, while research on other phytocannabinoids (e.g., cannabinol [CBN], cannabigerol [CBG]) and terpenes (e.g., d-limonene, β-myrcene, α-pinene) commonly found in the cannabis plant has been far more limited [\nThe entourage effect theory has influenced how cannabis products are cultivated, marketed, and consumed. For example, cannabis plants are being selectively bred to have specific cannabinoid and terpene profiles, driven by the belief that certain ratios of these compounds produce specific desired effects for the user [\nIn vitro receptor binding studies have shown mixed results, perhaps due to different methodological approaches, but there is evidence that some terpenes commonly found in cannabis have a CB\nα-Pinene, one of the most abundant terpenes found in cannabis and various other plant species, has gained interest due to its purported neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing properties [\nIn contrast to the cognitive-enhancing properties of α-pinene, Δ9-THC is well-documented for its acute deleterious effects on memory, particularly short-term and working memory impairments [\nThe present study utilized a double-blind, within-subjects crossover design. All participants completed a total of six outpatient drug administration sessions during which they inhaled α-pinene alone (15 mg), Δ9-THC alone (30 mg), Δ9-THC and α-pinene together (30 mg Δ9-THC + 0.5 mg α-pinene; 30 mg Δ9-THC + 5 mg α-pinene; 30 mg Δ9-THC + 15 mg α-pinene), or placebo (ambient air). The six experimental sessions were completed in a randomized order to minimize possible order effects and reduce bias [\nParticipants were recruited via internet advertisements and word-of-mouth communication. Interested individuals first completed a telephone or web-based screening questionnaire. Those who were eligible based on the initial screening were invited for an in-person evaluation consisting of written informed consent followed by a detailed medical history review and physical examination. A blood sample was taken for clinical chemistry testing and pregnancy testing for female volunteers, a urine sample was taken to test for recent illicit drug use (i.e., methamphetamine, PCP, cocaine, MDMA, oxycodone, morphine, amphetamine, methadone, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, buprenorphine, and Δ9-THC), a breath sample was taken to test for recent alcohol use, and the Timeline Follow-Back was used to assess non-medicinal drug and alcohol use over the past 90 days [\nStudy inclusion criteria were: (1) aged 18–55; (2) good health status as determined by in-person screening (e.g., medical exam, vital signs, blood clinical chemistry); (3) tested negative for drugs of misuse other than cannabis at screening and prior to each study visit; (4) not pregnant or breastfeeding; (5) body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 36 kg/m\nParticipants that met the above criteria were occasional cannabis smokers and were scheduled to complete the 6 drug exposure sessions. Upon arrival for each session, participants provided a urine sample to test for pregnancy/recent drug use, completed an alcohol breathalyzer, and self-reported their use of drugs/alcohol since their last visit via the Timeline Follow-Back (sessions were not conducted if the participant tested positive for pregnancy, alcohol use, or use of drugs aside from cannabis). Next, participants received a standard low-fat breakfast of toast and jam followed by baseline assessments of subjective effects, cognitive performance, and vital signs.\nAfter baseline assessments, participants were taken to a ventilated negative pressure chamber for drug self-administration under staff supervision. Participants inhaled either placebo (ambient air), α-pinene, Δ9-THC, or a combination of Δ9-THC and α-pinene using the Mighty Medic hand-held vaporizer (Storz and Bickel\nAll study drugs were prepared and dispensed by the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit (BPRU) Pharmacy. Synthetic Δ9-THC (>99% purity) was obtained from Δ9-THC Pharm GmbH (Frankfurt Am Main, Germany) and was dissolved in pharmacy-grade ethanol (190 proof; Spectrum Chemical, Gardena, CA, USA) to create a solution that was approximately 10% Δ9-THC/90% ethanol. Botanically derived α-pinene (>99% purity) was obtained from True Terpenes (Hillsboro, OR, USA). Prior to each experimental session, a pharmacist applied a precise amount of α-pinene and/or Δ9-THC using a micropipette to a steel wool dosing pad, which fit into a small dosing capsule (or “pod”) that was placed inside a hand-held vaporizer (Mighty Medic, Storz & Bickel, GmbH). Dosing pods containing Δ9-THC were kept out of the dosing chamber for approximately 30 min to allow the ethanol to dissipate prior to loading into the vaporizer.\nBecause there was no published safety or efficacy data related to the direct inhalation of α-pinene at the outset of the experiment, we conducted testing to ensure that α-pinene was effectively vaporized and not chemically altered by the vaporization process (GC/MS analysis of multiple test doses captured by a carbon filter). Doses of α-pinene were selected based on chemical analysis of 107 samples of cannabis, representing 29 unique cannabis cultivars, being sold by a licensed medical cannabis producer in Canada. Specifically, the two lower doses of α-pinene used in this study (0.5 mg and 5 mg) reflect the mean and max α-pinene doses contained in 1 g of cannabis flower based on the analyses of those cannabis samples. One gram is the amount of plant material commonly used to make a single cannabis cigarette (“pre-roll,” “joint,” or “blunt”). In addition to the 0.5 mg and 5 mg α-pinene doses, a 15 mg α-pinene dose was added into the study after pilot testing demonstrated safety at the two lower doses and a lack of overt impact of those doses on acute Δ9-THC exposure. Thus, doses used in this study were ecologically relevant and pilot testing demonstrated safety with respect to acute dosing via direct inhalation.\nSubjective drug effects, subjective ratings of mood, vital signs, and cognitive performance were assessed at baseline, immediately following drug exposure (i.e., time “0”), and 0.25, 0.5. 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h after drug exposure. Study measures were completed in the same order each time.\nA Drug Effect Questionnaire (DEQ [\nThe 35-item Profile of Mood States (POMS [\nCognitive performance was assessed using three tasks, the International Shopping List Test (ISLT [\nThe ISLT is a simple delayed verbal recall task that has been shown to be sensitive to acute cannabis exposure in prior controlled studies [\nThe PASAT is a task that predominantly assesses working memory, but also includes aspects of psychomotor ability and higher order cognition. In the task, participants viewed a string of single-digit numbers on a computer screen and were instructed to select the sum of the two numbers most recently presented on the computer screen by clicking on squares containing potential sum integers using the computer mouse. Numbers were presented at intervals ranging from 2.4 to 2.8 s for a total of 90 trials. The primary outcome for the PASAT was the total number of correct responses and secondary outcomes included percent correct responses and reaction time to both correct and incorrect responses.\nThe DSST is a task that predominantly assesses psychomotor ability, but also includes a working memory component of performance. In this task, participants were presented a series of patterns on the computer screen that needed to be replicated using the numerical keys on the computer keyboard as quickly and accurately as possible over a 90 s test period. The primary outcome for the DSST was the total number of correct responses and secondary outcome was the percent of correct responses.\nHeart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were measured in the seated position using an automated monitor.

This reversible and dynamic modification involves methyltransferases, demethylases, and reader proteins. Aberrant expression of m6A-related regulatory proteins in the nervous system significantly impacts neuronal physiology, contributing to mental disorders such as depression, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. This review summarizes the role of m6A methylation in the pathogenesis of mental disorders and highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target, providing a comprehensive reference for future research and clinical interventions.", "full_text": "Epigenetic modifications are heritable changes in gene expression driven by environmental factors or intracellular mechanisms that do not alter the DNA sequence.\nMental illnesses represent a significant global challenge, imposing substantial burdens on individuals, society, and economies.\nThe m6A modification is crucial for the normal development and physiological functioning of the nervous system, including its roles in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, synaptic transmission, and the cognitive function.\nGenetic loci regulating m6A levels as quantitative traits (m6A quantitative trait loci, or m6A-QTLs) have been identified in various human tissues, including the brain.\nIn this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying m6A methylation, its roles in psychiatric disorders, and its emerging potential as a therapeutic target. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature search of studies published before October 2024 using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We included original research articles and review papers investigating m6A methylation in the central nervous system and its association with mental disorders, based on human, animal, or cellular models. Articles were selected for their scientific relevance, methodological rigor, and novelty. Given the high prevalence of certain psychiatric conditions and the extent of related m6A research, this review focuses specifically on depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and substance addiction.\nThe m6A methylation modification is a dynamic and reversible process regulated by 3 core groups of factors: methyltransferases (“writers”), demethylases (“erasers”), and reader proteins (“readers”).\nOverview of the m6A RNA modification machinery. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is catalyzed by a multi-component writer complex comprising METTL3, METTL14, METTL16, WTAP, VIRMA (KIAA1429), RBM15/15B, and ZC3H13. These methyltransferases install m6A modifications on mRNA bases. The modification can be reversed by eraser enzymes such as FTO and ALKBH5, which mediate m6A demethylation. Reader proteins, including YTHDF1/2/3, YTHDC1/2, IGF2BP1/2/3, FMRP, PRRC2A, ELAVL1, eIF3, and HNRNPC/A2B1, recognize and bind to m6A-modified RNA to regulate various post-transcriptional processes, such as mRNA translation, degradation, and microRNA processing.\nThe biological functions of m6A methylation modification span a wide range of physiological processes, including hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, the cell cycle, and RNA metabolism.\nThe m6A modification is essential for nervous system development. The methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 play pivotal roles in neuronal differentiation; their deletion impairs the ability of neural stem cells to differentiate into neurons, disrupting neuronal formation and function.\nThe m6A modification also has effects on oligodendrocyte specialization and myelin formation. By recognizing the GGACU consensus motif in the Olig2-encoding sequence, the reading protein PRRC2A binds and stabilizes Olig2 mRNA in an m6A-dependent mechanism.\nThese findings underscore the diverse functions of m6A modification at various stages of nervous system development, including neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, glial cell maturation, and axonal growth. The dynamic regulation of m6A methylation highlights its critical importance as a fundamental mechanism underlying both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions.\nNeural plasticity, the remarkable ability of the nervous system to adapt to internal and external environmental changes, underpins advanced neural functions such as cognition and emotion. In neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, dysregulation of m6A is closely linked to synaptic protein dysfunction, impairing synaptic plasticity and contributing to deficits in learning and memory.\nIn the hippocampus, m6A methylation affects neural plasticity by modulating the miR-124-C/EBPα-FTO transcriptional axis, which regulates the expression of neural plasticity-related genes, such as\nMoreover, recent studies suggest that physical exercise can mitigate mental disorders by counteracting chronic stress-induced neural dysfunction.\nIn addition to stress factors, exposure to certain chemicals in the environment can also alter the level of m6A modification in neurons, thereby affecting neuroplasticity. For example, exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) results in an increase in m6A levels in hippocampal neurons, along with an upregulation of METTL3 expression. Treatment with STM2457, a selective METTL3 inhibitor, effectively suppresses BPA-induced m6A upregulation and restores normal synaptic transmission, further demonstrating the regulatory role of m6A in chemically induced changes in neural plasticity.\nCollectively, these findings highlight the indispensable role of m6A methylation in both the development and maintenance of neural plasticity. By regulating synaptic plasticity and neural function, m6A serves as a critical link between environmental stimuli, gene expression, and behavioral outcomes. Further investigation into the mechanisms of m6A in neural plasticity will deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of mental disorders, such as depression, and provide a strong theoretical foundation for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.\nStudies have highlighted that m6A modification plays a pivotal role in regulating neurotransmitter systems by modulating the expression of key genes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and receptor signaling. This is particularly evident in the dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems, both of which are closely linked to the pathophysiology of mental disorders.\nThe DA system is crucial for regulating emotions, motivation, and reward-related behaviors.\nFurther research has demonstrated that overexpression of FTO or the inhibition of m6A modification leads to a reduction in m6A levels within the striatum, resulting in decreased DA levels. This alteration in DA signaling may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD, suggesting that m6A could be a potential therapeutic target for DA-related disorders.\nSimilar to the DA system, the 5-HT system is vital for regulating mood, emotion, and behavior. m6A modification has been shown to influence 5-HT levels and neuronal transmission by regulating the expression of genes involved in 5-HT synthesis and metabolism.\nIncreasing evidence suggests that m6A methylation significantly influences the expression of inflammation-related genes and contributes to the development of various inflammation-associated diseases. For instance, FTO modulates the stability of cGAS mRNA by regulating m6A methylation levels, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.\nGiven the close correlation between neuroinflammation and the pathogenesis of mental disorders, as well as the role of m6A methylation in regulating neuroinflammatory processes, m6A methylation offers a promising target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating inflammation-related disorders.\nDepression is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, accompanied by intense feelings of guilt, changes in sleep and appetite, and other symptoms. In severe cases, cognitive dysfunction, abnormal behavior, and even hallucinations and delusions may occur.\nRecent studies have indicated that m6A methylation may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression (\nRoles and mechanisms of m6A modification in various mental disorders.\nPlasma or blood-derived population: *1: Patients with the first episode of schizophrenia (\nResearch on the Han Chinese population has revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the demethylase ALKBH5 may be risk factors for MDD in this group.\nFTO, another demethylase, is significantly downregulated in the hippocampus of both MDD patients and depressive mouse, leading to elevated methylation levels of Adrb2 mRNA. This methylation change mediates the development of depressive-like behaviors via the ADRB2-c-MYC-SIRT1 signaling pathway, which is also closely related to the therapeutic effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine.\nThe m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is highly expressed in CUS-induced depressive rat models, and silencing METTL3 improves cognitive deficits. Specifically, METTL3 mediates the m6A modification of pri-miR-221, promoting its maturation and upregulating miR-221-3p, which inhibits\nAs an important RNA modification, m6A methylation has shown potential as a biomarker in the diagnosis of various diseases, including cancers,\nPreclinical studies have demonstrated that modulating m6A levels can effectively reverse depressive-like behaviors in animal models. For instance, injecting cycloleucine, a compound that reduces m6A methylation by competitively inhibiting methionine adenosyltransferase (the enzyme responsible for synthesizing S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the primary methyl donor for DNA and RNA methylation) into a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors.\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by significant geographical and demographic variations. The incidence rate typically ranges from 0.5% to 1% in various countries and regions, although it may be higher in specific populations.\nResearch has demonstrated that dynamic changes in m6A modification are crucial for regulating neuronal function and are closely associated with the pathological mechanisms of schizophrenia. In the brain tissue of schizophrenia patients, abnormal levels of m6A modification may lead to dysregulated expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment and neuronal function, which subsequently affect neuronal morphology and functionality, potentially contributing to schizophrenia’s onset.\nThe development of schizophrenia is often associated with disrupted synaptic plasticity.\nIn addition to its role in disease onset, m6A modification is also implicated in the response to antipsychotic treatments. Studies have found significant changes in the methylation patterns of both DNA and RNA in schizophrenia patients following conventional drug treatment.\nThrough the analysis of m6A methylation patterns, researchers are gaining a deeper understanding of the biological basis of schizophrenia, thereby providing new approaches for early screening and personalized treatment.\nAutism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication skills, along with repetitive behaviors and restricted interests.\nIntegrated analysis of multi-omics data has revealed that abnormalities in m6A modification are closely linked to the onset of ASD,\nIn recent years, an increasing body of research has suggested that m6A methylation modification may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ASD. Through integrative multi-omics analyses, studies have found that abnormal m6A modification is closely associated with the onset of ASD.\nAnimal models and in vitro cell experiments have also confirmed the involvement of m6A modification in ASD pathogenesis. By manipulating m6A modification levels in cells using gene editing technologies, researchers observed gene expression changes associated with ASD, providing direct evidence for the role of m6A modification in the disorder.\nN6-methyladenosine modification contributes to the pathological process of ASD by regulating key signaling pathways. One critical m6A reader protein, YTHDF1, plays an essential role in axon and dendrite development. YTHDF1 regulates synaptic development and plasticity by promoting the translation of Robo3.1, an axon guidance protein. However, when mutations occur at the m6A modification sites, YTHDF1 loses its ability to regulate Robo3.1 translation, resulting in abnormal synaptic transmission and plasticity, which subsequently impairs memory consolidation.\nMoreover, research has found that in the hippocampal tissue of ASD patients or model mice, the expression of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is significantly downregulated, accompanied by downregulation of long non-coding RNA MALAT1 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while the expression of the inhibitory molecule SFRP2 is upregulated. These changes contribute to the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, exacerbating the pathological process of ASD.\nAbnormal m6A modification in ASD patients exhibits significant molecular characteristics, which could potentially serve as biomarkers for the disorder. By detecting m6A levels in peripheral blood, researchers could identify high-risk individuals for ASD before clinical symptoms appear, facilitating early intervention. Additionally, the combined use of m6A detection with other biomarkers, in conjunction with multi-omics data, could significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of ASD screening.\nCurrent research indicates that targeting m6A methylation regulation may provide new therapeutic strategies for ASD. For example, modulating METTL3 expression levels could repair the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, reduce hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and improve ASD-related behaviors. This highlights the important role of m6A modification in the pathogenesis of ASD and its potential as a therapeutic target. Future large-scale clinical studies and in-depth mechanistic investigations will provide further evidence to support this field.\nDrug addiction is a chronic and relapsing brain disorder, primarily characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, along with a loss of control over drug consumption.\nCocaine is a highly addictive stimulant. Research has shown that in a cocaine-induced mouse conditioned place preference (CPP) experiment, the expression of FTO in the hippocampus was significantly downregulated, while the expression of methyltransferases such as METTL3 and METTL14 did not show significant changes. This suggests that FTO may play a key role in the regulation of cocaine addiction. Further analysis through methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq), a technique that maps m6A-methylated RNA, revealed that the overall m6A modification levels in the hippocampus of cocaine-treated mice were significantly elevated when compared with control group, with changes in m6A peaks primarily involving genes related to glutamatergic synapses, long-term potentiation (LTP), axon guidance, and neuronal function. These findings indicate that the dynamic changes in FTO expression and m6A modification may mediate the onset of cocaine addiction by regulating synaptic maturation and localization.\nIn a separate study using opioids such as oxycodone to induce rewarding behaviors in mice, researchers observed a marked increase in the protein levels of METTL14 and overall m6A modification in striatal neurons. In contrast, the expression of PP1α, a protein phosphatase, was found to decrease. These results suggest a close relationship between m6A methylation and opioid addiction. Further investigation pointed to lncRNA HOTAIR as a potential mediator in this process.\nIn contrast to cocaine addiction, a study on morphine addiction in mice found that neither acute nor chronic morphine exposure significantly altered m6A modification levels or the expression of m6A methyltransferases (such as METTL3) in the brain. This suggests that m6A methylation modification may not be involved in the regulatory process of morphine addiction, or its mechanisms may differ from those involved in other addictive substances.\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is another prevalent form of addiction characterized by compulsive drinking, alcohol craving, increased tolerance, and severe withdrawal symptoms. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region involved in DA-mediated reward and pleasure, has been implicated in the development of alcohol addiction. In a mouse model of long-term alcohol consumption, RNA methylation changes were associated with specific gene expression alterations, leading to enhanced neural adaptation to alcohol. Through epigenomic microarray analysis, researchers identified 26 mRNAs and 4 lncRNAs in the NAc of AUD subjects that were highly methylated, while the methylation level of 3 mRNAs and 1 lncRNA was significantly reduced. These results suggest that m6A methylation may play a role in the neural adaptation processes underlying alcohol addiction. However, these findings need to be replicated in larger sample sizes, and future research should explore whether these changes are gender- or population-specific.\nThis review focused on 4 major psychiatric disorders—depression, schizophrenia, ASD, and drug addiction. Although other conditions such as anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorder also exhibit high prevalence and clinical importance, current research on m6A modification in these disorders remains limited. This gap underscores the need for future investigations, which may contribute to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets across a broader range of psychiatric conditions.\nThrough an integrated analysis of m6A modifications in the aforementioned disorders, we found that several key m6A-regulating enzymes, such as METTL3, ALKBH5, and FTO, exhibit similar patterns of dysregulation across different mental illnesses. Moreover, these enzymes are primarily involved in the onset and progression of psychiatric disorders by modulating similar processes, including neuroinflammation, neurodevelopment, and synaptic plasticity. These parallels not only reflect the presence of shared pathogenic mechanisms among various mental disorders but also underscore the indispensable role of m6A regulatory enzymes in initiating epitranscriptomic alterations that contribute to disease development.\nNevertheless, it is important to recognize that, although current studies on m6A modification in mental disorders remain limited, distinct brain region- or cell types-specific differences have been observed in the patterns of m6A modification and the expression of its regulatory enzymes across different psychiatric conditions. The specific RNAs undergoing m6A modification, as well as the downstream signaling pathways they modulate, also vary widely. Therefore, further elucidation of the downstream molecular networks governed by m6A modification is critically needed.\nLooking forward, this complexity poses an important question for therapeutic development: should strategies targeting m6A pathways adopt a broad-spectrum approach, or be tailored specifically to the molecular landscape of each disorder? Addressing this question will be essential for translating m6A-related findings into clinically meaningful interventions.\nFurthermore, the emergence of single-cell sequencing technologies provides new opportunities to investigate m6A methylation dynamics at high resolution. Future studies leveraging these approaches will enhance our understanding of m6A functions in distinct neuronal subtypes and disease-relevant cellular contexts.\nFinally, the development of small-molecule modulators—such as agonists or antagonists of m6A-associated proteins—holds great promise for therapeutic innovation. Such tools may enable precision medicine approaches tailored to individual molecular profiles. Continued research in this direction will not only deepen our understanding of m6A biology but also advance the design of effective, targeted treatments for psychiatric disorders.", "content_for_embedding": "Epigenetic modifications are heritable changes in gene expression driven by environmental factors or intracellular mechanisms that do not alter the DNA sequence.\nMental illnesses represent a significant global challenge, imposing substantial burdens on individuals, society, and economies.\nThe m6A modification is crucial for the normal development and physiological functioning of the nervous system, including its roles in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, synaptic transmission, and the cognitive function.\nGenetic loci regulating m6A levels as quantitative traits (m6A quantitative trait loci, or m6A-QTLs) have been identified in various human tissues, including the brain.\nIn this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying m6A methylation, its roles in psychiatric disorders, and its emerging potential as a therapeutic target. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature search of studies published before October 2024 using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We included original research articles and review papers investigating m6A methylation in the central nervous system and its association with mental disorders, based on human, animal, or cellular models. Articles were selected for their scientific relevance, methodological rigor, and novelty. Given the high prevalence of certain psychiatric conditions and the extent of related m6A research, this review focuses specifically on depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and substance addiction.\nThe m6A methylation modification is a dynamic and reversible process regulated by 3 core groups of factors: methyltransferases (“writers”), demethylases (“erasers”), and reader proteins (“readers”).\nOverview of the m6A RNA modification machinery. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is catalyzed by a multi-component writer complex comprising METTL3, METTL14, METTL16, WTAP, VIRMA (KIAA1429), RBM15/15B, and ZC3H13. These methyltransferases install m6A modifications on mRNA bases. The modification can be reversed by eraser enzymes such as FTO and ALKBH5, which mediate m6A demethylation. Reader proteins, including YTHDF1/2/3, YTHDC1/2, IGF2BP1/2/3, FMRP, PRRC2A, ELAVL1, eIF3, and HNRNPC/A2B1, recognize and bind to m6A-modified RNA to regulate various post-transcriptional processes, such as mRNA translation, degradation, and microRNA processing.\nThe biological functions of m6A methylation modification span a wide range of physiological processes, including hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, the cell cycle, and RNA metabolism.\nThe m6A modification is essential for nervous system development.

The three phytocompounds, phloridzin (−11.10 kcal/mol), rhapontin (−11.02 kcal/mol), and diosmetin 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (−10.96 kcal/mol), exhibited binding affinities comparable to or slightly lower than that of the native ligand, yet superior to those of the reference drugs. Despite this, their similar interaction profiles with other potent ligands suggests, they may still exhibit significant inhibitory potential against MAO-B. This is further explored in the subsequent section, where they are highlighted as additional promising candidates for further exploration in therapeutic applications targeting NDDs.\nThe chemical structures of the top-ranked phytochemicals identified through molecular docking analyses are presented in\nProtein-ligand interactions are fundamental to biological processes such as cell transduction, receptor modulation, enzyme action, and biochemical pathways, and even in drug discovery process [\nHydrophobic interactions involving key amino acid residues\nThe consistent involvement of key amino acid residues within the orthosteric site demonstrated by shared hydrophobic interactions observed with the native ligand and reference MAO-B inhibitors (rasagiline, L-deprenyl, and safinamide) highlights their fundamental role in ligand recognition and binding. Importantly, the top phytochemical candidates not only involved these conserved residues but also formed additional hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds with other surrounding amino acids. The presence of other interactions, including Pi-stacking, may enhance the overall binding affinity and stability of these ligands within the active site. This expanded interaction network may enhance the candidate phytochemicals’ capacity to effectively disrupt or inhibit MAO-B’s normal biological function by strengthening binding site occupancy [\nWhile hydrophobic interactions may play a key role in initial ligand binding, the inclusion of other types of interactions is likely to contribute to enhanced overall binding stability, specificity, and functional dynamics, making them essential considerations in molecular docking and drug design strategies [\nThe persistence of structural and geometrical stability of protein-ligand adducts can be inspected through multiple metrics extracted from MDS trajectories. The adduct is considered more stable if the ligand stays bound to the orthosteric site for a longer duration while maintaining its orientation and location relative to the protein backbone [\nA spatial examination of the ligand at the receptor’s orthosteric site was conducted using snapshots taken at various time points to assess its translational and rotational movements throughout the production phase. The stability and sustained binding of the ligand were evaluated to assess its potential as an effective inhibitor.\nIn first complex, beta-sitosterol exhibited only minor orientation changes at 50, 100, 150, and 200 ns compared to its position at 1 ns in the adduct. The ligand demonstrated the minimal translational movement, as evidenced by the consistently low and stable RMSD profile that is to be explored in more detail in the RMSD discussion section. While the core structures of both the protein and ligand remained largely unchanged, the inherent flexibility of the loops near the ligand facilitated their movement to avoid steric clashes and optimize interactions. This flexibility allowed the ligand to undergo slight orientation shifts within the binding pocket, most notably at 50 ns, as observed in the corresponding snapshot. In the second complex, minor loop repositioning and subtle adjustments in nearby alpha-helices were observed at 50 ns, accompanied by slight torsional changes in squalene to enhance binding. The same location of squalene at 100, 150, and 200 ns is further corroborated by the plateau observed in its RMSD curve, indicating stable binding. In the third complex, etretinate, remained at nearly the same location throughout the simulation, maintaining a consistent orientation at 50, 100, 150, and 200 ns, with a slight deviation observed at 1 ns, indicating an initial settling phase. The protein backbone maintained stable orientations until around 150 ns, after which movement in the alpha helices was observed, that led to minor adjustments to the protein structure. In the fourth complex, rhoifolin exhibited a minor change in its orientation at 50 ns, which was maintained until 100 ns. A further slight shift in orientation occurred at 150 ns, which remained stable until the end of simulation at 200 ns. The protein maintained a conserved position throughout, indicating stable ligand-protein interaction with minimal conformational changes towards the end of the simulation. In the fifth complex, both the protein and the ligand, swertisin, maintained a consistent orientation throughout the simulation from 1 ns to 200 ns. This stability indicated a persistent binding interaction throughout this time frame, as evidenced by the consistently smooth RMSD curve (\nThe snapshots confirmed stable ligand binding across all complexes, with minimal conformational changes. This indicates the conservation of orientation and location of the ligand in the complexes. Ligand-protein interactions remained consistent, and the protein structure displayed some flexibility in key regions to optimize binding, as further discussed in the subsequent sections. Quantitative details, including mathematical parameters, are presented to evaluate complex stability, complementing the visual insights from the snapshots taken at different time points of the MDS trajectory.\nRMSD is a crucial parameter for evaluating the stability of protein-ligand complexes. A higher RMSD suggests greater deviation from the reference conformation over time, while a stable RMSD suggests system equilibration, and persistent fluctuations may imply ongoing structural adjustments [\nBeta-sitosterol (violet) showed an initial rise around 8 ns as the ligand adjusted to the binding site, followed by a plateau until 175 ns with a negligible fluctuation at 175 ns, indicated nearing stabilization, supported by a low average RMSD of (0.26 nm ± 0.04 nm). This suggested minimal ligand movement and a stable binding pose. Squalene (green) exhibited an initial rise in RMSD within the first 10 ns, followed by a stable plateau, indicating consistent stability. Etretinate (red) showed a gradual rise with minor fluctuations toward the end, suggesting slight binding adjustments. The average RMSD were 0.66 ± 0.04 nm for squalene and 0.66 ± 0.05 nm for etretinate. Rhoifolin (cyan) exhibited an initial fluctuation in its RMSD curve, followed by a smooth decline until 145 ns, after which the curve elevated steadily, maintaining a smooth trajectory until the end of the simulation. The average RMSD for rhoifolin was 0.24 ± 0.06 nm. The upward shift in the RMSD after 145 ns could be attributed to the rotational motion of the ligand while swertisin (magenta) exhibited a smooth, stable curve with an average RMSD of 0.27 ± 0.03 nm with minimal fluctuation with no any orientation change of the ligand, as discussed above (\nFor the ligand-complexes with binding affinities (docking scores) slightly lower than the native ligand, phloridzin (blue) exhibited a moderate RMSD curve with minimal fluctuations up to 105 ns, yielding an average RMSD of 0.40 ± 0.03 nm. In contrast, rhapontin (orange) and diosmetin 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (maroon) displayed nearly flat RMSD curves with minimal fluctuations, with average RMSD of 0.26 ± 0.03 nm and 0.25 ± 0.05 nm, respectively.\nIn conclusion, based on the RMSD analysis, rhoifolin, beta-sitosterol, and swertisin demonstrated the most stable binding with low RMSD and minimal fluctuations, making them the strongest candidates for further study and potential inhibitors of receptor function. Squalene and etretinate exhibited slight flexibility but maintained stable binding, suggesting effective binding despite minor conformational adjustments. Rhapontin and diosmetin 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside showed stable binding, though with slightly higher RMSD than the top candidates. In contrast, phloridzin exhibited weaker binding with higher RMSD, indicating less stability in its complex. However, all ligands exhibited stable binding at the active site while maintaining their conserved poses, suggesting their potential to modulate the target protein.\nThe RMSD of apo protein (black) with respect to the protein backbone, showed a relatively stable trajectory with minimal fluctuations upto\nThe RMSD analysis of protein backbone demonstrates that it remained stable across all ligand complexes, with no significant geometric changes or structural deviations. This indicates that the protein maintained its overall stability, with its conformation largely unaffected by ligand binding. Consequently, the target protein is considered druggable, as it can effectively bind ligands at its catalytic site, leading to the formation of a stable adduct.\nRMSF quantifies the flexibility of individual atoms or residues in a molecular system by evaluating their variations from average positions over time in molecular dynamics simulations [\nAll the protein backbone of top eight complexes exhibited RMSF below\nThe solvent accessible surface area (SASA) represents the surface area of a macromolecule that is accessible to solvent molecules. It is a critical parameter in understanding molecular interactions, folding, and stability in protein-ligand complexes [\nThe absence of distinct upward or downward trends in the curves indicates that ligand binding does not induce significant conformational changes in the protein’s surface structure. SASA for the apo protein was calculated as 219.44 ± 4.31 nm\nRPDF serves as a statistical measure of spatial distribution of the ligand atoms around the protein, where g(r) indicates the probability of finding the ligand’s center of mass at a certain distance (r) from the protein’s center of mass [\nComplex 1 (0.96 nm), 2 (0.62 nm), 3 (1.79 nm), and 5 (1.44 nm) showed prominent, sharp peaks at relatively short distances in the RPDF plots, with Complex 2 showing the tallest spike at 0.62 nm, among the complexes. In contrast, Complex 3 displayed the shortest spike at 1.79 nm. This suggests that these ligands are tightly bound to the protein and maintain a consistent distance from it. Complexes 4 (1.08 nm), 6 (0.95 nm), 7 (0.97 nm), and 8 (1.26 nm) exhibited relatively broader peaks. This indicates that these ligands have a wider range of distances from the protein. They might be more flexible in their binding or have greater freedom of movement within the catalytic pocket.\nThe presence of a single distinct peak for each complex indicated that the ligands consistently occupied a specific spatial region relative to the protein, demonstrating their localized and conserved positioning within the orthosteric binding site throughout the simulation. This observation signifies the stability of their binding poses and highlights their sustained interaction with the protein over time.\nThe radius of gyration (R\nThe radius of gyration (R\nThese results suggest that the proteins in all complexes, as well as the apo protein, maintained a similar level of compactness, with only minor variations in R\nH-bonds play a vital role in establishing and maintaining the structural integrity of proteins and the complexes. These bonds continuously form and break as proteins adapt their structure, for example, when shifting from a non-functional to functional states [\nFor Complex 1, the count ranged from 1 to 2, indicating that at any given time, a maximum of two hydrogen bonds were observed. Most of the time, 1 hydrogen bond was consistently present, suggesting a relatively stable interaction. Occasional spikes to 2 hydrogen bonds were observed, indicating transient formation of additional interactions. Some brief instances of gap in the hydrogen bond count curve, might suggest that the ligand temporarily lost contact or reoriented itself within the binding pocket. For Complex 3, for most of the simulation time, 1 hydrogen bond was consistently observed. Occasional formation of 2 or 3 H-bonds was observed intermittently. The periodic formation of 2–3 hydrogen bonds could signify dynamic binding, where the ligand interacts with multiple residues depending on its orientation or the protein’s conformational changes. For Complex 4, the number of H-bonds exhibited the cause of significant fluctuations throughout the simulation. This was expected, as H-bonds are dynamic interactions that constantly form and break in molecular systems. The H-bond count appeared to oscillate between approximately 1 and 6. Similar nature was observed for Complex 5, with H-bond count ranged from 1 to 5. Similarly for complex 6, 7, and 8, the H-bond count ranged from 1–6, 1–6, and 1–7 respectively. S7 Fig in\nThe range in the plots observed was approximately 0.25 nm to 0.35 nm, which falls within the typical hydrogen bond range (2.5–3.5 Å or 0.25–0.35 nm). The single peak of the distribution curve for the complexes indicates low variability in the donor-acceptor distances.\nSimilarly, in the same complex, the amino acid residue TYR435 formed a moderately stable hydrogen bond, which persisted throughout the production run. The average donor-acceptor (D-A) distance was 0.32 ± 0.06 nm, with slight fluctuations at\nThe Gibbs free energy of binding change (ΔG) is a fundamental thermodynamic parameter that determines the stability and favorability of protein-ligand complex formation [\nWhere,\nThe formation of the complex is opposed by the Poisson-Boltzmann solvation energy, the only positive term. However, the negative contributions from van der Waals interactions (the predominant factor), electrostatic forces, and non-polar interactions surpass the Poisson-Boltzmann energy, ultimately favoring the complex formation. Additionally, S8 Fig in\nThe high failure rate of drug candidates in clinical trials is predominantly linked to inadequate pharmacokinetic properties or unacceptable toxicity profiles [\nBased on pkCSM’s validated ADMET prediction, beta-sitosterol and squalene demonstrated favorable absorption (HIA > 89%), significant blood-brain barrier penetration (logBB > 0.78; threshold >0.3), and adequate CNS permeability (logPS ≤ −1.70; threshold > −2), supporting their potential as CNS-targeted therapeutics. Both compounds exhibited no cytochrome P450 inhibition, reducing drug-interaction risks and displayed moderate to high metabolic clearance (logCL = 0.62 and 1.79 mL/min/kg, respectively; thresholds: > 1.0 = high, 0.3–1.0 = moderate), suggesting once to twice daily dosing feasibility. Critically, they showed no predicted hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity (hERG), mutagenicity (AMES), or skin sensitization. In contrast, rhoifolin and swertisin were found unsuitable for CNS targets due to poor absorption (HIA 24–51%), negligible brain exposure (logBB ≤ −1.56, logPS ≤ −3.90), and P-gp efflux liability. Etretinate, while well-absorbed (HIA 95.94%) and moderately brain-penetrant (logBB = 0.23), displayed hepatotoxicity risk. These predictions are consistent with the known pharmacokinetic and metabolic limitations approved MAO-B inhibitors; for instance, safinamide exhibited limited CNS permeability (logPS= −2.70) while rasagiline and L-deprenyl are documented inhibitors of CYP1A2, underscoring that even clinically utilized compounds are not devoid of ADMET-related constraints. Collectively, squalene and beta-sitosterol represent promising candidates with optimized ADMET properties for further development as MAO-B inhibitors, offering enhanced metabolic stability and safety over existing therapeutics like rasagiline (skin sensitizer) or deprenyl (hepatotoxic) (S3 Table in\nSqualene and beta-sitosterol were identified as optimal MAO-B inhibitor candidates, exhibiting superior CNS bioavailability, favorable clearance, and minimal toxicity or drug-interaction risks, compared to the existing drugs; safinamide, deprenyl, and rasagiline as validated by pkCSM-based ADMET profiling. Comparable conclusions have been reported in previous studies [\nNevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the inherent limitations of relying solely on computational methods in drug discovery. While these approaches provide valuable preliminary insights into molecular behavior, pharmacokinetics, and potential efficacy, they are subject to potential inaccuracies arising from model assumptions and simplifications. Molecular docking, in particular, has a limited ability to comprehensively represent the conformational flexibility of both receptors and ligands, which can affect the accuracy of predicted binding poses and affinities. MDS, although useful for exploring biomolecular dynamics, are constrained by short simulation timescales, computational demands, and sensitivity to initial conditions, potentially limiting their capacity to capture long-term conformational changes. Additionally, computational techniques face challenges in fully capturing the complexity and dynamic nature of biological systems.

The ligand demonstrated the minimal translational movement, as evidenced by the consistently low and stable RMSD profile that is to be explored in more detail in the RMSD discussion section. While the core structures of both the protein and ligand remained largely unchanged, the inherent flexibility of the loops near the ligand facilitated their movement to avoid steric clashes and optimize interactions.

In contrast, rhoifolin and swertisin were found unsuitable for CNS targets due to poor absorption (HIA 24–51%), negligible brain exposure (logBB ≤ −1.56, logPS ≤ −3.90), and P-gp efflux liability. Etretinate, while well-absorbed (HIA 95.94%) and moderately brain-penetrant (logBB = 0.23), displayed hepatotoxicity risk. These predictions are consistent with the known pharmacokinetic and metabolic limitations approved MAO-B inhibitors; for instance, safinamide exhibited limited CNS permeability (logPS= −2.70) while rasagiline and L-deprenyl are documented inhibitors of CYP1A2, underscoring that even clinically utilized compounds are not devoid of ADMET-related constraints. Collectively, squalene and beta-sitosterol represent promising candidates with optimized ADMET properties for further development as MAO-B inhibitors, offering enhanced metabolic stability and safety over existing therapeutics like rasagiline (skin sensitizer) or deprenyl (hepatotoxic) (S3 Table in\nSqualene and beta-sitosterol were identified as optimal MAO-B inhibitor candidates, exhibiting superior CNS bioavailability, favorable clearance, and minimal toxicity or drug-interaction risks, compared to the existing drugs; safinamide, deprenyl, and rasagiline as validated by pkCSM-based ADMET profiling. Comparable conclusions have been reported in previous studies [\nNevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the inherent limitations of relying solely on computational methods in drug discovery. While these approaches provide valuable preliminary insights into molecular behavior, pharmacokinetics, and potential efficacy, they are subject to potential inaccuracies arising from model assumptions and simplifications. Molecular docking, in particular, has a limited ability to comprehensively represent the conformational flexibility of both receptors and ligands, which can affect the accuracy of predicted binding poses and affinities. MDS, although useful for exploring biomolecular dynamics, are constrained by short simulation timescales, computational demands, and sensitivity to initial conditions, potentially limiting their capacity to capture long-term conformational changes. Additionally, computational techniques face challenges in fully capturing the complexity and dynamic nature of biological systems.

A log-linear association between the absolute magnitude of LDL-C exposure and ASD risk has been widely studied. High levels of LDL-C have been acknowledged as the predominant culprit. The previous research findings have demonstrated that PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) can remarkably diminish the risk of ASD. The current research has primarily focused on the relevance of PCSK9 to the cardiovascular system and lipid metabolism; however, an increasing body of evidence shows that PCSK9 is pivotal in pathogenic processes in other organ systems. Yet, PCSK9’s impact on the brain is complex and not fully clarified, although several recent studies emphasize a putative role of its impact on various neurodegenerative disorders. Among neurological disorders, not only stroke but neurogenesis, neural cell differentiation, central LDL receptor metabolism, neural cell apoptosis, neuroinflammation, alcohol use disorder (AUD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are related to PCSK9. PCSK9 expression in brain is low but greatly upregulated in neurological disorders. Therefore, PCSK9 is a promising pathway for the treatment of central nervous diseases. This review comprehensively describes evidence from the previous research on the effects of PCSK9i on the central nervous system, with a focus on the clinical potential of PCSK9i. We anticipate that this review will generate data that will help biomedical researchers or clinical workers develop treatments for the neurological diseases based on PCSK9i.", "full_text": "Atherosclerosis-related disease (ASD), a lipoprotein-driven disease that leads to plaque formation at specific sites of the arterial tree through intimal inflammation, necrosis, fibrosis, and calcification, causing clinical disease through luminal narrowing or by precipitating thrombin that obstruct blood flow to the heart (coronary heart disease), brain (ischemic stroke), or lower extremities (peripheral vascular disease) [\nInitially, atorvastatin, a well-known lipid-lowering drug, can decrease cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) to lower LDL-C levels [\nPCSK9-induced mechanism of peripheral and central oxidative stress.The role of PCSK9 in the regulation of circulating LDL-C levels is ascribed to binding of circulating PCSK9 to the LDLR and subsequent lysosomal degradation of LDLR. In the liver, PCSK9 binds to the LDL-C and LDLR complex, targeting subsequent lysosomal degradation of LDLR and increasing of plasma LDL-C in the blood vessel. Next, the accumulation and deposition of cholesterol form an atherosclerotic plaque within the artery wall that can narrow the blood vessel, activating and recruiting immune cells such as macrophages. PCSK9 directly binds to CD36 also activates the Nox2 pathway that interact with LDL-C to produce oxLDL in these active immune cells. The latter produces ROS, and oxLDL binds to both CD36 and LOX1, promoting Nox2 activation. In the brain, oxidative stress causing neuronal damage and endothelial cells death is mainly due to oxLDL-mediated excessive ROS production by activated immune cells. However, all these cascades are attenuated when the PCSK9 inhibitor is used.\nPCSK9i were discovered to be a novel kind of lipid-lowering drugs, which blocked the interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR, preventing LDLR degradation in hepatocytes [\nLinear structure, functional domains and key modifications of PCSK9. The structures of proPCSK9 contain the 3 distinct structural domains: the N-terminal domain (prodomain, amino acids 31–152), the catalytic subunit (amino acids 153–451), and the C-terminal domain (CHRD; amino acids 453–692), each playing critical roles in the regulation of PCSK9 and its intracellular traffic. The CHRD is composed of 3 tandem repeats rich in Cys and His residues (Cys/His-rich domain). The LDLR binds the catalytic domain of PCSK9, while the MHC-I complex interacts with the M2 repeat of the CHRD. On the other hand, CAP1 binds the M1 and M3 domains of the CHRD and enhances PCSK9 activity. Prior to the cleavage of the SP (residues 1–30), it was pre-proPCSK9.

We comprehensively collected and synthesized articles from previous research on the effects of PCSK9 on the central nervous system, with a focus on the clinical potential of PCSK9i to generate data that will help biomedical researchers or clinical workers develop treatments for the neurological diseases based on PCSK9i.\nThe PCSK9 gene in humans is located at chromosome 1p32, comprising 11 introns and 12 exons [\nRoles for PCSK9 and the underlying mechanisms that link PCSK9 activation and neurological diseases. Under physiological conditions, circulating PCSK9 does not cross into CNS because of the existence of BBB. In the CNS, locally produced PCSK9 may not only act on LDLR, LRP1, VLDLR, and apoER2 that are expressed by neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, but also on LRP1 and CD36 that are expressed by microglia. The PCSK9 can modulate these receptors and thereby regulate lipid homeostasis, neurogenesis, apoptosis, and inflammatory processes in the brain. However, central neurological diseases may be accumulated by known molecular pathways when dysfunction of certain receptors occurs.\nInterestingly, a variety of agents or processing and modulation can considerably determine its activation or inactivation via acting in their specific areas to achieve the aim of regulating expression levels of PCSK9. Øystein L. et al. described that the affinity of PCSK9 for the LDLR enhanced by tenfold and the degradation of the LDLR in endosomes or lysosomes of hepatocytes increased by fourfold when removing the prosegment stretch (N-terminal acidic stretch, amino acids 31–53) of PCSK9, resulting in faster endocytosis of the complex into lysosome-like compartments at the neutral pH [\nAlthough PCSK9 was first identified in 2003 in neurons of the cerebellum, originally called neural apoptosis-regulated convertase-1 (NARC-1) [\nThe reason PCSK9 named NARC-1 is it was initially discovered in an apoptotic cellular model in primary cerebellar neurons [\nThe tissue and cell lines of NARC-1 show unique patterns identical to those of other convertases [\nAs the most cholesterol-rich tissue/the tissue richest in cholesterol of the human body, the brain’s principal carrier of cholesterol is apoE [\nThe first critical explanation of the mechanism of how PCSK9 regulates LDL-C levels came from experimental reports of Maxwell and Breslow. In their study, PCSK9 overexpression in wild-type (WT) mice caused a twofold increase in plasma total cholesterol and a fivefold increase in nonhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol primarily due to the increase in LDL cholesterol, with a near absence of LDLR protein [\nFurthermore, Cohen et al. reported that subjects carried truncating Y142X or C679X heterozygote LOF mutations of PCSK9 showed about 40% reductions in LDL-C levels, confirming the fact that PCSK9 may be acting stoichiometrically on the LDLR [\nIn addition to the effect of PCSK9 on elevating blood LDL-C levels, a multitude of clinical studies clearly demonstrate that PCSK9 plays an important role in neuroinflammation. In the study of Apaijai, the association between PCSK9 inhibition and neuronal responses in a rat model of cardiac ischemic/reperfusion injury (I/R) injury was investigated for the first time. They first used confocal microscopy to observe microglia morphology, and found that cardiac I/R injury could increase astrocytic activation and only pretreatment with PCSK9i did restore the levels in astrocytic activation to the basal levels of the sham group following cardiac I/R. As we all know, amyloid plaque formation can be recognized as one phenomenon of neurodegeneration, which was assessed in these experiments as the expression of Aβ protein levels. And then, in the brains of rats with cardiac I/R injury and vehicle treatment, Aβ was significantly increased by 2.4‐fold (\nApoE has emerged as a pivotal anti-inflammatory agent in a number of neurodegenerative disorders (NDD), including AD, ischemic stroke [\nCharacterized by an impaired ability to control or stop alcohol intake, AUD is a chronic relapsing condition [\nAUD comorbid with liver disease is extremely common [\nALS is a fatal NDD that, by definition, is characterized by selective and progressive involvement of upper and lower motor neurons [\nTo the best of our knowledge, a successive accumulation of cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) is one peculiar hallmark of AD pathogenesis, which correlates with the progressive cognitive decline in AD. The clearance of cerebral Aβ exceeds its production rate in physiological conditions [\nIn the experiments of Mazura et al., FDA-approved monoclonal anti-PCSK9 antibodies were injected intraperitoneally into the AD mouse model 5xFAD to inhibit endogenous PCSK9 activity to achieve the aim of evaluating whether therapeutic targeting of peripheral PCSK9 would increase Aβ brain clearance in vivo. Finishing the above operations, they observed that treating 5 × FAD mice with low-concentrated Alirocumab for 10 weeks resulted in significantly reduced Aβ pathology compared to control-treated 5xFAD mice accompanied by unaffected general behavior [\nNTDs are severe congenital malformations affecting approximately 0.6–6 per 1000 pregnancies [\nIn clinical practice, PCSK9i are mainly used in the cardiovascular field. More recently, an involvement of PCSK9 in PD has been suggested. Jahed et al. found that LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol levels were significantly lower in PD patients [\nPCSK9i are a nonstatin preparation that can reduce LDL-C levels and lowering LDL-C levels can reduce ischemic complications. Therefore, there are some relevant reports in the field of neurology. In the studies of Oyama and colleagues, the second FDA-approved PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab reduced first acute arterial events [including acute coronary, cerebrovascular (ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or urgent cerebral revascularization), or peripheral vascular] by 19% [hazard ratio (HR): 0.81, 95% CI 0.74–0.88;\nPCSK9i are a group of drugs that controls LDL receptor expression at the plasma membrane, and PCSK9’s receptors are widely distributed in the brain, heart, immune systems, kidneys, liver, small intestine, vascular structure, and other organs. PCSK9 plays essential roles in hyperlipidemia and ASD and is also related to other diseases, including viral infections, sepsis, tumors, and immune checkpoint regulation in cancer, highlighting the potential therapeutic effects of PCSK9i in treating these diseases. This section will introduce their application in more detail.\nThe PCSK9 has a vital effect on the activation of a number of enveloped viruses [\nAlthough PCSK9 is the best known for regulating cholesterol metabolism, growing research indicates its involvement in cellular aging and the development of age-related diseases. Since cancer incidence increases with age, PCSK9 has recently emerged as a potential modulator of tumor progression and patient outcomes, warranting further investigation into its oncogenic role. As highly demanding anabolic steps, tumor growth and metastasis are especially relevant to PCSK9 [\nWe discussed the potential of PCSK9i beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, highlighting their benefits in various neurological conditions and their potential as a therapeutic target. However, there are several disadvantages or limitations in the information presented. This article mentions a wide range of neurological conditions (AD, AUD, ALS, NTDs, and PD) with lack of understanding the precise mechanisms of action. More and more clinical trials or studies are needed to draw strong conclusions to support the observed connection, which implies that current evidence may be insufficient or preliminary. The primary limitations of PCSK9 inhibitors in broader therapeutic applications include (1) incomplete understanding of their tissue-specific effects beyond hepatic cholesterol metabolism, (2) potential off-target impacts on immune cell function due to PCSK9’s pleiotropic roles, and (3) limited clinical data on long-term safety in noncardiovascular contexts. Future research should prioritize multi-omics approaches to elucidate PCSK9’s extra-hepatic mechanisms, develop targeted delivery systems to minimize systemic effects, and conduct well-designed clinical trials evaluating combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors or conventional chemotherapeutics. In addition, investigating isoform-specific modulation rather than global PCSK9 inhibition may yield more precise therapeutic strategies. In addition, we thought that findings from PCSK9i could be translated into therapeutic or preventive approaches for CNS disorders, but it does not address the challenges in translating preclinical or clinical trial results into approved therapies. The key challenges in translating preclinical PCSK9 inhibitor findings into clinical neurology therapies include (1) the blood–brain barrier (BBB) limiting CNS bioavailability of current monoclonal antibody inhibitors, (2) insufficient understanding of PCSK9’s cell-type-specific roles in neurons versus glia, (3) potential disruption of physiological cholesterol homeostasis required for synaptic plasticity, and (4) lack of validated biomarkers to assess target engagement in the human CNS. Future research should focus on developing BBB-penetrant small molecule inhibitors or nanoparticle delivery systems [\nThe FDA’s approval of PCSK9 inhibitors for indications beyond hypercholesterolemia will depend on robust clinical evidence demonstrating therapeutic efficacy, a favorable risk–benefit profile, validated biomarkers, and mechanistic insights linking PCSK9 to disease pathology. Pharmaceutical companies face challenges, such as high development costs, complex trial designs (especially for neurological disorders), market competition, and reimbursement uncertainties. In addition, optimizing drug formulations—particularly for blood–brain barrier penetration in CNS diseases—remains a key hurdle.\nPCSK9 inhibitors demonstrate superior LDL-C reduction efficacy (50–60% decrease) as compared to statins (30–50%) and ezetimibe (15–20%), with particularly strong benefits in statin–intolerant patients, while maintaining a favorable safety profile with mostly mild injection-site reactions. Unlike statins which exhibit pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects or ezetimibe’s intestinal cholesterol absorption blockade, PCSK9 inhibitors uniquely modulate LDL receptor recycling, offering potential advantages in broader applications including neuroprotection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer immunotherapy through their immunomodulatory effects on T-cells and tumor microenvironment. However, their current injectable administration and higher cost limit accessibility as compared to oral statins and ezetimibe, although emerging oral PCSK9-targeting drugs may bridge this gap in the future.\nThe most promising noncardiovascular research directions for PCSK9 inhibitors include: (1) neurodegenerative disorders, AD and PD, where modulating brain cholesterol metabolism may reduce amyloid/tau pathology and neuroinflammation; (2) oncology, particularly in enhancing immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy by optimizing T-cell function through LDLR-mediated mechanisms; (3) autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, leveraging PCSK9’s immunomodulatory effects on macrophage polarization; and (4) sepsis management, targeting PCSK9’s role in inflammatory cytokine regulation. Emerging evidence also suggests potential applications in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through hepatic lipid metabolism modulation and in diabetic complications via vascular protection mechanisms. The current research is actively exploring blood–brain barrier–penetrant formulations and combination therapies to maximize therapeutic potential across these diverse conditions.\nHowever, the cost and accessibility barriers limit widespread adoption. High pricing and prior authorization requirements restrict patient access, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Future strategies to improve affordability may include biosimilar development, value-based pricing models, and expanded insurance coverage. In addition, advancements in oral small-molecule PCSK9 inhibitors could enhance convenience and reduce costs as compared to injectable monoclonal antibodies. Looking ahead, interdisciplinary research, public–private partnerships, and innovative trial designs will be critical to fully realize the therapeutic potential of PCSK9 inhibition across diverse diseases while ensuring equitable patient access.\nIt is becoming clear that the reach of PCSK9i extends beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and its associated vascular complications. The function of PCSK9 inhibition in clinical trials has shown added benefits of AD, AUD, ALS, NTDs, and PD, leading to the design of efficacious strategies to reduce PCSK9 expression. Nevertheless, more clinical trials aimed at PCSK9 inhibition are expected to conclude effective and strong conclusions. PCSK9 inhibition is considered an attractive therapeutic target for therapy, especially in light of the fact that a large proportion of high-risk neurological diseases are associated with PCSK9. It remains to be determined whether FDA-approved PCSK9i and more findings can be translated into newly approved therapeutic approaches for targeted CNS disorders. It would be fascinating if such drugs could be designed, produced in large quantities, and become prescriptions for clinical practice application in the future. Thus, we expect more PCSK9i for the treatment to be approved by more countries’ FDA in the future. In this review, we mainly focus on introducing the roles of PCSK9 and its trials, and briefly describe the latest research progress of target drugs.

The current research is actively exploring blood–brain barrier–penetrant formulations and combination therapies to maximize therapeutic potential across these diverse conditions.\nHowever, the cost and accessibility barriers limit widespread adoption. High pricing and prior authorization requirements restrict patient access, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Future strategies to improve affordability may include biosimilar development, value-based pricing models, and expanded insurance coverage. In addition, advancements in oral small-molecule PCSK9 inhibitors could enhance convenience and reduce costs as compared to injectable monoclonal antibodies. Looking ahead, interdisciplinary research, public–private partnerships, and innovative trial designs will be critical to fully realize the therapeutic potential of PCSK9 inhibition across diverse diseases while ensuring equitable patient access.\nIt is becoming clear that the reach of PCSK9i extends beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and its associated vascular complications. The function of PCSK9 inhibition in clinical trials has shown added benefits of AD, AUD, ALS, NTDs, and PD, leading to the design of efficacious strategies to reduce PCSK9 expression. Nevertheless, more clinical trials aimed at PCSK9 inhibition are expected to conclude effective and strong conclusions. PCSK9 inhibition is considered an attractive therapeutic target for therapy, especially in light of the fact that a large proportion of high-risk neurological diseases are associated with PCSK9. It remains to be determined whether FDA-approved PCSK9i and more findings can be translated into newly approved therapeutic approaches for targeted CNS disorders. It would be fascinating if such drugs could be designed, produced in large quantities, and become prescriptions for clinical practice application in the future. Thus, we expect more PCSK9i for the treatment to be approved by more countries’ FDA in the future. In this review, we mainly focus on introducing the roles of PCSK9 and its trials, and briefly describe the latest research progress of target drugs. We anticipate that this study will help biomedical researchers or clinical workers treat PCSK9-related CNS diseases by providing ideas for developing novel drug strategies or scientific research ideas.", "topic": "Neuroinflammation"}

Overall, 73.3% of cases (responders and partial responders) showed a reduction in seizure frequency with CBD treatment; in particular, 46.7% of patients achieved a significant reduction (>50%) in seizures (7/15 responders), with two cases displaying seizure freedom. Notably, none of the patients reported worsening of seizure frequency. These data were consistent with those reported in the literature. Particularly, real-world studies highlighted a significantly reduction in seizure frequency, with rates ranging from 36.9 to 68.8% of the patients investigated (\nIn our sample, 8 patients were treated with a combination of clobazam and CBD, which demonstrated a good effectiveness in reducing seizure frequency. Specifically, 7/8 patients —comprising 3 with LGS, 1 with DS, and 3 with DRE — were identified as responders or partial responders. It has been proposed that the potential bidirectional drug interaction between CBD and clobazam may influence the overall effect and safety of CBD as an antiepileptic therapy, increasing the exposure to active metabolites of both drugs (\nAlthough the mechanisms underlying CBD effects in humans are still not fully understood, evidence suggested that its action is multimodal, involving both cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid pathways, which may account for its strong anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties (\nNoteworthy, malformations of cortical development were observed in 6 of our patients: patient 1 had bilateral subcortical band heterotopia; patient 3 displayed a malformative pattern, including abnormalities in cortical gyration of the occipital-temporo-mesial regions; patient 4 showed lissencephaly; patient 8 had cortical tubers, consistent with the typical TSC neuroimaging pattern; patient 9 presented with frontal polymicrogyria in the context of Aicardi syndrome; and patient 10 exhibited bilateral parietal focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). It is crucial to point out that all these patients showed a good response to CBD, with 66.6% (4 out of 6 cases) experiencing a > 50% reduction in seizures, representing 57.1% of all the “best” responders (4 out of 7 cases – patients 1, 8, 9, and 10); the remaining 2 patients (33.3%) showed a seizure reduction between 30 and 50%, accounting for 40% of all partial responders (2 out of 5 patients – patients 3 and 4) (\nIn addition to these molecular interactions, CBD has been shown to induce notable changes in brain connectivity. Specifically, studies have highlighted modifications in resting-state functional connectivity, particularly in inter-regional connections between the vermis, amygdala, hippocampus, and frontal cortex. Moreover, CBD appears to influence attentional processes by modulating the functional connectivity between the superior frontal gyrus and the insula/middle frontal gyrus (\nIn our series, CBD treatment was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse event was transient irritability/hyperactivity (33%), which was dose-dependent or occurred during the titration phase; gastrointestinal disturbances were recorded in only one case (6.7%).

The retrospective design may introduce biases related to data collection and the reliance on medical records and caregiver reports, potentially affecting the accuracy and consistency of the findings. The small sample size, which reduces statistical power, limits the further stratification by clinical variables (i.e., genetic etiology, epilepsy type) and affects the generalizability of our findings to the broader pediatric DRE population. Although improvements in seizure frequency and socio-environmental participation were documented, the assessment relied on subjective tools such as the CGI scale. In retrospective studies, this subjectivity—combined with potentially incomplete data—may increase the risk of bias. Another limitation lies in the heterogeneity of the cohort, including differences in genetic profiles and baseline characteristics, which complicates the interpretation of treatment response variability. Furthermore, the retrospective design also precluded monitoring of CBD metabolite serum levels (i.e., 7-OH-CBD, 7-COOH-CBD, 6-OH-CBD), limiting correlations between pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes (\nAlthough these results are based on a limited sample size, they support the implementation of CBD as an add-on treatment in pharmacoresistant epileptic syndromes. Future research should focus on exploring the use of CBD in DREs beyond the currently approved indications, such as LGS, DS, and TSC. Additionally, the existing literature on the effect of CBD in DREs involving malformations of cortical development is currently limited, and further studies should be conducted to confirm this correlation. Expanding the application of CBD to other forms of DRE, including those with malformations of cortical development or complex genetic etiologies, could uncover additional therapeutic benefits and broaden its clinical utility.\nFuture frontiers of research should focus on achieving the deep understanding of CBD-related effects on seizures, as well as its action on environmental participation and overall neuropsychiatric comorbidities that could positively affect also on behavioral and social skills outcomes.\nIn conclusion, CBD may represent a promising therapeutic option capable of enhancing the clinical management of DRE.

However, their limitations including sever side effects and lack of long‐term efficacy are significant concerns. There is an urgent need for disease‐modifying therapies that can prevent the progression of refractory PD.\nAltogether, our study highlights for the first time that FGF13 protects neurons against degeneration by restraining the transfer of stressful mitochondrial to adjacent glia, and thereby preventing irrepressible neuroinflammation. Of particular significance, Abacavir, which targets the elevation of neuronal FGF13, effectively combats mitochondria‐derived damage signals and demonstrates efficacy in relieving neurodegenerative phenotype in a mouse model for PD.\nAll animal‐related experiments were carried out in strict compliance with the institutional ethical guidelines for animal care at Nanjing Medical University (IACUC – 2008067).

Then the brains embedded in OCT were cut into 20 µm‐thick slices on coronal plane. Brain slices were simply washed three times in PBS. All slices were subsequently blocked with 5% BSA and 0.3% Triton X‐100 in PBS (5% BSA/PBST), and then incubated with primary antibody in 4 °C overnight followed by incubation of the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. In Diaminobenzidin (DAB)‐dependent IHC analysis, brain sections are incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity before blocking with 5% BSA/PBST.

All slices were subsequently blocked with 5% BSA and 0.3% Triton X‐100 in PBS (5% BSA/PBST), and then incubated with primary antibody in 4 °C overnight followed by incubation of the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. In Diaminobenzidin (DAB)‐dependent IHC analysis, brain sections are incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity before blocking with 5% BSA/PBST. After rinsing with PBS following horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‐labeled secondary antibody incubation, the slices were visualized by the DAB (Boster, Cat#AR1002) reaction for 5 min. IHC images were visualized under the microscope (Olympus) with stereo Investigator software, which was used to count the number of positive cells. Fluorescently labeled sections were visualized with the confocal scanning laser microscope (Carl Zeiss). The fluorescent area in each image was quantified in ImageJ software.

The slides were soaked in the mixture of solution A and B from nissl staining kit (KeyGEN, Cat#KGA4104) as the manufacture's instruction, and then dehydrated with alcohol and xylene. The images were visualized under the microscope (Olympus), and the stereo Investigator software was used to count the number of positive cells.\nCells and brain tissues were lysed in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher, Cat#A32961). After centrifugation, protein concentration of the lysate surpernatant was measured with BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#23250) and equal amount of protein was separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE) electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred from gel to 0.20 µm nitrocellulose membrane (Pall Corporation, Cat#66485).

It is characterized by age-inappropriate inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity levels that significantly impair daily functioning (\nNeuroinflammation is hypothesized to contribute to the etiology of ADHD by disrupting neurodevelopmental processes through early-life alterations in microglia, astrocytes, cytokines, chemokines, oxidative stress, and associated molecular pathways (\nDespite the significant emphasis on inflammation in ADHD research, most studies have primarily focused on biomarkers such as cytokines, chemokines, and oxidative stress markers. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of these biomarkers remains constrained by their limited availability, high costs, and the complexity of their measurement procedures (\nInterestingly, the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), a ratio initially developed for tumor assessment (\nMethylphenidate (MPH) is the first-line pharmacological treatment for ADHD in children and adolescents (\nThis study hypothesizes that children with ADHD exhibit a pro-inflammatory state compared to healthy individuals and that MPH treatment is associated with an anti-inflammatory profile. Therefore, the primary aim was to evaluate differences in NHR, MHR, LHR, PHR, and SII levels between untreated children with ADHD and healthy controls at baseline. Furthermore, we sought to assess changes in NHR, MHR, LHR, PHR, and SII levels before and after 12 weeks of treatment with long-acting MPH in children with ADHD. Lastly, we aimed to explore whether these inflammatory markers differed between ADHD subtypes before and after treatment.\nThis study was conducted in 2024 at the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry outpatient clinic of Ankara Etlik City Hospital. A total of 166 children (113 boys and 53 girls), aged between 6 and 12 years (mean age: 8.89 ± 1.79 years), were included in the study. The study employed a prospective and open-label design.\nADHD patients and healthy control groups were determined based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria for the patient group were as follows: (a) age between 6 and 12 years, (b) meeting the diagnostic criteria for ADHD according to the DSM-5, and (c) obtaining informed consent from both the child and their parents to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria included: (a) the presence of any psychiatric disorder other than oppositional defiant disorder, (b) the presence of a neurological or genetic disorder, (c) the presence of a chronic systemic disease (e.g., endocrinological, allergic, immunological, cardiac and hematologic disease), (d) the presence of liver or kidney failure or malignancy, (e) abnormal leukocyte and platelet values indicative of active infection (leukocytosis: >10 × 10\nThe control group comprised psychiatrically and physically healthy children who were age—and sex-matched to the ADHD group. These children were recruited from outpatients who presented to the child psychiatry clinic for consultation and volunteered to participate in the study. To ensure the absence of any psychiatric disorder, they were screened through clinical psychiatric interviews based on DSM-5 criteria. The same exclusion criteria applied to the ADHD group were also implemented for the healthy control group.\nFlowchart of the study enrollment protocol.\nThe Ethics Committee of Ankara Etlik City Hospital approved the study (Protocol No: AEŞH-2024-0076). By the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, all parents and children were informed about the study, and consent forms were signed.\nAn informative psychoeducational session was held for all participants and their parents, focusing on the effects of ADHD and its treatment on attention and behavioral control. During the session, treatment options for ADHD, including the effects and potential side effects of medications, were all explained in detail Subsequently, a demographic information form (age, gender, grade level, etc.) was completed by the ADHD and control groups. Height and weight measurements were recorded, and body mass index (BMI, kg/m²) was calculated. A semi-structured clinical interview using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children–Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) was administered to all participants and their parents to assess psychiatric comorbidities. Parents of children diagnosed with ADHD completed the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form (CPRS-R:S) and the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS).\nBlood samples from all participants were collected the following morning between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM (after 12 hours of fasting), provided there were no acute or severe illnesses.\nAt recruitment, all patients were naive to any type of MPH and had received no other pharmacologic or psychological treatment. In the study, only long-acting MPH was used in the ADHD group. Parents were advised to administer the medication daily, including on weekends. The initial dose was set at 0.5 mg/kg/day, and dose adjustments were made based on treatment response and tolerability (absence of adverse symptoms).\nAfter initiating medication, patients were assessed biweekly. In-person evaluations were conducted at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 in the clinic, while interim assessments were conducted via telephone. At each visit, parents were queried regarding medication adherence. Participants who missed more than three doses throughout the study were classified as non-adherent and subsequently excluded from the analyses.\nBlood samples were collected from ADHD patients at baseline and week 12 to evaluate NHR, LHR, MHR, PHR, and SII levels. At these time points, clinicians assessed ADHD symptom severity and anxiety and depression symptom levels using the CPRS-R: S (\nVenous blood samples were analyzed to measure total cholesterol, HDL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), and CBC-derived values, including monocyte, neutrophil, platelet, and lymphocyte counts. Hemogram parameters were recorded in x10\nThe NHR was determined by dividing the neutrophil count by the HDL level. At the same time, the MHR, LHR, and platelet-to-HDL ratio (PHR) were similarly calculated by dividing respective cell counts by HDL levels. SII, a novel indicator of immune activity and inflammatory status, was calculated using the formula: (Platelet count) × (Neutrophil count/Lymphocyte count).\nBMI (kg/m²) was calculated, and age-specific percentiles were determined based on the World Health Organization (WHO) growth reference curves (\nThe CPRS-R:S (\nThe Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS), developed by Chorpita et al.

The mean age of the ADHD group was 8.8 ± 1.76 years (range: 6–12 years), with 79 (69.3%) males and 35 (30.7%) females. The control group had a mean age of 9.05 ± 1.84 years (range: 6–12 years), comprising 34 (65.4%) males and 18 (34.6%) females. There were no statistically significant differences in mean age (p = 0.450) or gender distribution (p = 0.747) between the ADHD and control groups. Similarly, BMI and BMI percentiles showed no significant differences between the groups (p = 0.667 and p = 0.583, respectively). Prior to treatment, 27.2% (n = 31) of the ADHD group were categorized as having the inattentive subtype, 2.4% (n = 4) as the hyperactive-impulsive subtype, and 69.3% (n = 79) as the combined subtype.\nDuring the pre-treatment evaluation, the ADHD group exhibited significantly higher levels of NHR, LHR, MHR, and PHR than controls (p = ≤ 0.001, p = 0.005, p = 0.003, and p = ≤ 0.001, respectively). In addition, a significant difference in the SII levels was observed between the two groups (p = 0.031).

However, post-treatment LHR levels were significantly higher in the combined presentation subtype compared to the inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity subtypes (p = 0.015) (\nThe values of NHR\nThis 12-week, open-label, single-center observational prospective study examined the levels of a group of novel CBC-derived inflammatory markers, including NHR, LHR, MHR, PHR, and SII, in ADHD patients compared to healthy controls, and investigated the impact of long-acting methylphenidate treatment on these markers in children aged 6–12 years. As far as we know, this is the first study to longitudinally evaluate various common hematologic parameters related to inflammation in children with ADHD. Baseline comparisons revealed significant differences in NHR, LHR, MHR, PHR and SII levels between patients with ADHD and healthy controls. After 12 weeks of long-acting methylphenidate treatment, significant reductions in NHR, LHR, MHR, PHR and SII levels were observed in patients with ADHD. Following treatment, LHR levels were found to be higher in ADHD-C compared to other subtypes. However, no significant differences were observed in other markers either before or after treatment among ADHD subtypes.\nNHR, LHR, MHR, and PHR are comprehensive markers of systemic inflammation derived from routine CBC parameters, incorporating measurements such as HDL, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets. These components are closely linked to inflammation and oxidative stress (\nRecent studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder exhibit significantly higher NHR, LHR, MHR, and PHR values compared to healthy adults (\nThe SII has increasingly been recognized as a practical biomarker for systemic inflammation. Previous studies have demonstrated the significant role of SII in predicting the prognosis of patients with physical conditions such as tumors, neurological and cardiac diseases, and acute pancreatitis (\nIn our study, no significant relationship was found between pre-treatment NHR, LHR, MHR, PHR, and specific ADHD subtypes. Our findings align with previous research on inflammatory markers in ADHD. For instance, studies conducted on adults with ADHD have demonstrated no significant differences in IL-6, TNF-α, and morning cortisol levels between the combined and inattentive subtypes (\nIn this study, post-treatment levels of NHR, LHR, MLR, PHR, and SII in the ADHD group were significantly lower compared to pre-treatment levels. The existing literature underscores the importance of further research to evaluate changes in these biomarkers before and after pharmacological treatment in patients with ADHD, aiming to enhance our understanding of the role of inflammation in its etiology (\nThis study should be evaluated in light of its strengths and limitations. Among its strengths, the prospective design employed for children with ADHD, the use of standardized and validated assessment tools (CPRS-R:S, RCADS), and the evaluation of biological parameters (lipid profile, inflammatory markers) are notable. In addition, including a control group allowed for comparative analyses, enhancing the study’s methodological rigor. However, several limitations should also be considered. First, the study was conducted in a single center and employed an open-label design, which may limit the generalizability and introduce potential observer bias. Second, the narrow age range of the sample and the exclusion of psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., disorders other than oppositional defiant disorder) and chronic medical conditions ensured a focus on a homogeneous ADHD group but simultaneously excluded the common real-world occurrence of ADHD with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions. This may limit the applicability of the findings to routine clinical practice. Furthermore, the reliance solely on parent-reported measures, without incorporating teacher or self-reported assessments, increases the risk of single-source bias. The 12-week duration of this study may have been insufficient to assess the long-term effects of extended-release MPH on inflammation comprehensively. Additionally, this study did not include several promising inflammatory biomarkers, and there was an absence of measurement for potential confounding variables such as dietary habits and physical activity, which may have influenced the outcomes.\nThis study provides significant insights into the relationship between ADHD and systemic inflammation. It demonstrated that a 12-week treatment with long-acting MPH significantly reduced inflammatory markers such as NHR, LHR, MHR, PHR, and SII. These findings suggest that MPH not only alleviates core symptoms of ADHD but also modulates inflammatory processes, highlighting the potential role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Furthermore, the study emphasizes that hematologic ratios derived from routine blood tests can serve as accessible and cost-effective biomarkers for assessing systemic inflammation in ADHD. However, these findings should be considered preliminary and insufficient to support clinical application without further validation.\nThese findings hold important implications for both research and clinical practice. Associating ADHD treatment with changes in inflammatory markers contributes to the growing evidence supporting the role of immune dysregulation in ADHD. The observed anti-inflammatory effects of MPH underline the necessity of exploring its broader biological impacts and its potential long-term effects on ADHD outcomes.\nFuture studies should address the limitations of this research by focusing on the long-term effects of MPH on inflammation. In addition, incorporating advanced biomarkers such as cytokines, oxidative stress indicators, and neuroinflammatory markers could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Research examining the relationship between systemic inflammation and ADHD subtypes, as well as the potential impact of comorbid conditions, will further enhance our understanding of these complex interactions.", "content_for_embedding": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition affecting approximately 5.3% of the pediatric population.

The same exclusion criteria applied to the ADHD group were also implemented for the healthy control group.\nFlowchart of the study enrollment protocol.\nThe Ethics Committee of Ankara Etlik City Hospital approved the study (Protocol No: AEŞH-2024-0076). By the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, all parents and children were informed about the study, and consent forms were signed.\nAn informative psychoeducational session was held for all participants and their parents, focusing on the effects of ADHD and its treatment on attention and behavioral control. During the session, treatment options for ADHD, including the effects and potential side effects of medications, were all explained in detail Subsequently, a demographic information form (age, gender, grade level, etc.) was completed by the ADHD and control groups. Height and weight measurements were recorded, and body mass index (BMI, kg/m²) was calculated. A semi-structured clinical interview using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children–Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) was administered to all participants and their parents to assess psychiatric comorbidities. Parents of children diagnosed with ADHD completed the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form (CPRS-R:S) and the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS).\nBlood samples from all participants were collected the following morning between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM (after 12 hours of fasting), provided there were no acute or severe illnesses.\nAt recruitment, all patients were naive to any type of MPH and had received no other pharmacologic or psychological treatment. In the study, only long-acting MPH was used in the ADHD group. Parents were advised to administer the medication daily, including on weekends. The initial dose was set at 0.5 mg/kg/day, and dose adjustments were made based on treatment response and tolerability (absence of adverse symptoms).\nAfter initiating medication, patients were assessed biweekly. In-person evaluations were conducted at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 in the clinic, while interim assessments were conducted via telephone. At each visit, parents were queried regarding medication adherence. Participants who missed more than three doses throughout the study were classified as non-adherent and subsequently excluded from the analyses.\nBlood samples were collected from ADHD patients at baseline and week 12 to evaluate NHR, LHR, MHR, PHR, and SII levels. At these time points, clinicians assessed ADHD symptom severity and anxiety and depression symptom levels using the CPRS-R: S (\nVenous blood samples were analyzed to measure total cholesterol, HDL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), and CBC-derived values, including monocyte, neutrophil, platelet, and lymphocyte counts. Hemogram parameters were recorded in x10\nThe NHR was determined by dividing the neutrophil count by the HDL level. At the same time, the MHR, LHR, and platelet-to-HDL ratio (PHR) were similarly calculated by dividing respective cell counts by HDL levels. SII, a novel indicator of immune activity and inflammatory status, was calculated using the formula: (Platelet count) × (Neutrophil count/Lymphocyte count).\nBMI (kg/m²) was calculated, and age-specific percentiles were determined based on the World Health Organization (WHO) growth reference curves (\nThe CPRS-R:S (\nThe Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS), developed by Chorpita et al. (\nData were analyzed using SPSS\nThis study included 114 patients with ADHD and 52 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The mean age of the ADHD group was 8.8 ± 1.76 years (range: 6–12 years), with 79 (69.3%) males and 35 (30.7%) females. The control group had a mean age of 9.05 ± 1.84 years (range: 6–12 years), comprising 34 (65.4%) males and 18 (34.6%) females. There were no statistically significant differences in mean age (p = 0.450) or gender distribution (p = 0.747) between the ADHD and control groups. Similarly, BMI and BMI percentiles showed no significant differences between the groups (p = 0.667 and p = 0.583, respectively). Prior to treatment, 27.2% (n = 31) of the ADHD group were categorized as having the inattentive subtype, 2.4% (n = 4) as the hyperactive-impulsive subtype, and 69.3% (n = 79) as the combined subtype.\nDuring the pre-treatment evaluation, the ADHD group exhibited significantly higher levels of NHR, LHR, MHR, and PHR than controls (p = ≤ 0.001, p = 0.005, p = 0.003, and p = ≤ 0.001, respectively). In addition, a significant difference in the SII levels was observed between the two groups (p = 0.031). Detailed demographic and blood count parameters for both groups are provided in\nComparison of demographic and complete blood count parameters between ADHD patients and healthy controls.\nPearson Chi-square (χ2), Mann-Whitney U test (Z) and student’s t test (t) were used for between-group analyses.

The variables included in the model were NHR, LHR, MHR, and PHR. The SII marker was excluded from the analysis due to its high correlation with NHR and LHR, indicating potential multicollinearity. Model fit was evaluated using Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistics (p = 0.439). The model’s explanatory power was assessed using Cox & Snell R² and Nagelkerke R² (0.127 and 0.179, respectively).

However, post-treatment LHR levels were significantly higher in the combined presentation subtype compared to the inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity subtypes (p = 0.015) (\nThe values of NHR\nThis 12-week, open-label, single-center observational prospective study examined the levels of a group of novel CBC-derived inflammatory markers, including NHR, LHR, MHR, PHR, and SII, in ADHD patients compared to healthy controls, and investigated the impact of long-acting methylphenidate treatment on these markers in children aged 6–12 years. As far as we know, this is the first study to longitudinally evaluate various common hematologic parameters related to inflammation in children with ADHD. Baseline comparisons revealed significant differences in NHR, LHR, MHR, PHR and SII levels between patients with ADHD and healthy controls. After 12 weeks of long-acting methylphenidate treatment, significant reductions in NHR, LHR, MHR, PHR and SII levels were observed in patients with ADHD. Following treatment, LHR levels were found to be higher in ADHD-C compared to other subtypes. However, no significant differences were observed in other markers either before or after treatment among ADHD subtypes.\nNHR, LHR, MHR, and PHR are comprehensive markers of systemic inflammation derived from routine CBC parameters, incorporating measurements such as HDL, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets. These components are closely linked to inflammation and oxidative stress (\nRecent studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder exhibit significantly higher NHR, LHR, MHR, and PHR values compared to healthy adults (\nThe SII has increasingly been recognized as a practical biomarker for systemic inflammation. Previous studies have demonstrated the significant role of SII in predicting the prognosis of patients with physical conditions such as tumors, neurological and cardiac diseases, and acute pancreatitis (\nIn our study, no significant relationship was found between pre-treatment NHR, LHR, MHR, PHR, and specific ADHD subtypes. Our findings align with previous research on inflammatory markers in ADHD. For instance, studies conducted on adults with ADHD have demonstrated no significant differences in IL-6, TNF-α, and morning cortisol levels between the combined and inattentive subtypes (\nIn this study, post-treatment levels of NHR, LHR, MLR, PHR, and SII in the ADHD group were significantly lower compared to pre-treatment levels. The existing literature underscores the importance of further research to evaluate changes in these biomarkers before and after pharmacological treatment in patients with ADHD, aiming to enhance our understanding of the role of inflammation in its etiology (\nThis study should be evaluated in light of its strengths and limitations. Among its strengths, the prospective design employed for children with ADHD, the use of standardized and validated assessment tools (CPRS-R:S, RCADS), and the evaluation of biological parameters (lipid profile, inflammatory markers) are notable. In addition, including a control group allowed for comparative analyses, enhancing the study’s methodological rigor. However, several limitations should also be considered. First, the study was conducted in a single center and employed an open-label design, which may limit the generalizability and introduce potential observer bias. Second, the narrow age range of the sample and the exclusion of psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., disorders other than oppositional defiant disorder) and chronic medical conditions ensured a focus on a homogeneous ADHD group but simultaneously excluded the common real-world occurrence of ADHD with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions. This may limit the applicability of the findings to routine clinical practice. Furthermore, the reliance solely on parent-reported measures, without incorporating teacher or self-reported assessments, increases the risk of single-source bias. The 12-week duration of this study may have been insufficient to assess the long-term effects of extended-release MPH on inflammation comprehensively. Additionally, this study did not include several promising inflammatory biomarkers, and there was an absence of measurement for potential confounding variables such as dietary habits and physical activity, which may have influenced the outcomes.\nThis study provides significant insights into the relationship between ADHD and systemic inflammation. It demonstrated that a 12-week treatment with long-acting MPH significantly reduced inflammatory markers such as NHR, LHR, MHR, PHR, and SII. These findings suggest that MPH not only alleviates core symptoms of ADHD but also modulates inflammatory processes, highlighting the potential role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Furthermore, the study emphasizes that hematologic ratios derived from routine blood tests can serve as accessible and cost-effective biomarkers for assessing systemic inflammation in ADHD. However, these findings should be considered preliminary and insufficient to support clinical application without further validation.\nThese findings hold important implications for both research and clinical practice. Associating ADHD treatment with changes in inflammatory markers contributes to the growing evidence supporting the role of immune dysregulation in ADHD. The observed anti-inflammatory effects of MPH underline the necessity of exploring its broader biological impacts and its potential long-term effects on ADHD outcomes.\nFuture studies should address the limitations of this research by focusing on the long-term effects of MPH on inflammation. In addition, incorporating advanced biomarkers such as cytokines, oxidative stress indicators, and neuroinflammatory markers could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Research examining the relationship between systemic inflammation and ADHD subtypes, as well as the potential impact of comorbid conditions, will further enhance our understanding of these complex interactions.", "topic": "Neuroinflammation"}

While there has been substantial progress in the development of therapeutic strategies for relapsing disease, the field has lagged behind in its understanding and management of progressive stages of the disease, including secondary progressive and primary progressive MS, respectively. It is now thought that distinct but temporally overlapping mechanisms underlie relapsing and progressive aspects of the disease. Relapsing disease is characterized by waves of peripheral immune cell activation and CNS infiltration leading to focal destruction of the white matter, while progressive disease is thought to be driven by chronic, low-grade multifocal inflammation contained within the CNS compartment. Specifically, peripheral B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells take up residence within niches of the inflamed CNS, such as the leptomeninges and the Virchow-Robin spaces, where complex interactions between peripheral and CNS resident cells serve to maintain these cellular aggregates and further propagate CNS injury. In particular, immune infiltrates within the meninges are tightly associated with a specific form of cortical injury, termed subpial cortical demyelination, which is thought to be a key pathologic driver of disease progression. Cortical injury in the MS brain likely occurs via a combination of multiple immune-mediated and degenerative processes, perhaps including the production of diffusible toxic mediators by peripheral immune cells retained within the meninges. A better understanding of the interplay between peripheral immune and CNS resident cells is not only relevant to our concept of the disease process, but also represents a novel target for therapeutic intervention that is more specific to progressive disease biology. This review will focus on the role of CNS-compartmentalized inflammation in the development of cortical injury in MS, with a particular emphasis on the importance of immune-CNS crosstalk in disease progression.", "full_text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with variable clinical course and rates of progression of neurological disability.

As will be described in greater detail below, leukocortical/intracortical lesions are thought to reflect mechanisms of perivascular inflammatory injury that are likely shared with classic WMLs. In contrast, the subpial component of cortical injury is thought to reflect progressive, non-relapsing disease biology\nFour types of demyelinated lesions have been described in the cortex of MS patients: leukocortical (type I), intracortical (type II), and subpial (type III, sometimes further divided into types III and IV)\nPrior to discussing the potential mechanisms underlying the development and clinical consequence of these different cortical lesions, there are several challenges to studying cortical lesions in general that should be considered. First, correlating clinical outcomes with pathological findings requires tissue samples that are generally obtained via either post-mortem autopsy or by clinically indicated stereotactic brain biopsy. In either case, the individuals studied may not be representative of the general MS population. Post-mortem tissue typically originates from patients at the latest stages of disease and may fail to capture key mechanisms involved in prior tissue injury. In turn, biopsy specimens are obtained from a group of individuals with enough atypical lesional activity to warrant tissue sampling\nLeukocortical lesions are demyelinating plaques that involve the subcortical white matter and adjacent cortex. Pathologically, leukocortical lesions appear to originate around a central vein or venule in the subcortical white matter and spread out radially to involve part of the overlying cortex\nThe frequency of leukocortical lesions in MS brains largely depends on the population studied. Leukocortical lesions were shown to represent anywhere from 15% to 34% of the total cortical lesion burden in post-mortem tissue\nA few studies have investigated the relative contribution of different cortical lesions to disease outcomes, and it is interesting to note that several have demonstrated a robust association between leukocortical lesions and cognitive impairment even at early phases of disease\nThe presumed white matter origin of leukocortical lesions (as focal perivascular inflammatory plaques) is thought to be driven, like other WMLs, by CNS infiltration of autoreactive T cells, which are subsequently reactivated in the meninges, CSF, or perivascular spaces\nThough the full spectrum of active, mixed active-inactive, and inactive lesions has been described in the cortex of MS patients\nIntracortical lesions are similar to both leukocortical and typical WMLs in that they also form around post-capillary veins or venules, though they tend to be much smaller and, like the cortical components of leukocortical lesions, less inflammatory\nBBB permeability is an important feature of focal demyelination in the MS CNS.

A recent study using archival MS tissue specimens demonstrated that meningeal inflammation was associated with selective loss of\nBeyond traditionally implicated molecules, a series of studies have demonstrated that products released into the medium by cultured MS patient-derived B cells were selectively cytotoxic\nAnother potential mechanism by which B cells may be involved in cortical injury relates to the description of EBV-infected plasma cells in both the MS meninges and parenchyma and their association with cytotoxic T cells in the perivascular cuffs of actively demyelinating lesions\nPro-inflammatory factors released into the CSF may also indirectly lead to cortical damage by activating CNS-resident cells, such as microglia and astrocytes\nOverall, multiple mechanisms are likely to drive cortical injury in MS, and the heterogeneity of progression observed in patients both clinically and pathologically suggests that the predominant process(es) at play may differ across patients as well as within any given patient over time.\nWhile axonal transections and neuronal loss are associated with demyelination in WMLs\nThe question then remains as to what additional pathogenic mechanisms are at play that culminate in the profound degree of cortical atrophy observed in MS patients over time. Demyelination itself may contribute to cortical neurodegeneration to a certain extent via loss of trophic support to axons\nSeveral lines of evidence support the concept that CNS-resident cells and infiltrating immune cells, whether contained within the perivascular spaces or meninges, communicate bidirectionally to both propagate CNS-compartmentalized inflammation and incite damage in the cortical parenchyma. Regarding the compartmentalized immune response, meningeal immune cell collections have been associated with more pronounced perivascular inflammation in the cortex, which may reflect greater meningeal inflammation solicited in response to more perivascular inflammation in the subjacent tissue, or alternatively, may indicate that more meningeal inflammation promotes greater immune cell perivascular infiltration in the underlying cortex via upregulation of certain chemokines and/or adhesion molecules on brain or endothelial cells\nNext, with regard to cortical damage, B cells and other immune cells in the meninges (or in Virchow-Robin spaces) may produce factors that diffuse into the parenchyma and indirectly or directly induce cortical demyelination and neurodegeneration\nNonetheless, the communication between meningeal immune collections and CNS cells is likely bidirectional in that activated cells within the CNS, including microglia, astrocytes, and perivascular infiltrates, signal back to both immune and stromal cells in the meninges to promote lymphocyte retention within the meningeal compartment\nThe literature often refers to relapsing MS disease mechanisms as “inflammatory” and progressive disease mechanisms as “degenerative”. However, the now well-documented association between meningeal inflammation, cortical injury, and clinical progression in MS points to underlying inflammatory mechanisms that may be viable targets for therapeutic intervention in progressive MS. This does not preclude an effort to further study as well as target degenerative disease mechanisms, but suggests that different types of inflammation, playing out in different anatomic compartments, contribute to distinct processes of CNS injury throughout the MS course.\nWith the recent approval of three drugs for the treatment of progressive forms of MS -ocrelizumab for PPMS and siponimod and cladribine for SPMS - it is of interest to consider the mechanisms by which these therapeutic benefits are mediated and, in particular, whether their ability to limit disease progression reflects, at least in part, targeting of CNS-compartmentalized immune responses relevant to cortical injury. A major challenge to establishing this is that each treatment has a robust effect on relapsing MS biology, which would be expected to limit relapse-related progression of disability. Here, we briefly consider how each agent may impact non-relapsing disease mechanisms.\nOcrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD20, was shown to have a modest but significant beneficial effect on limiting confirmed disability progression in both RRMS and PPMS patients\nSiponimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, was approved for the treatment of active SPMS\nAs with siponimod, the oral agent cladribine is approved for use in active SPMS patients\nEfforts are ongoing to better understand how current and emerging therapies may beneficially impact both the CNS-compartmentalized immune response and neurodegeneration, wherein therapies could either interfere with detrimental cell processes or promote remyelination and repair of neural elements", "content_for_embedding": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with variable clinical course and rates of progression of neurological disability.

Demyelination itself may contribute to cortical neurodegeneration to a certain extent via loss of trophic support to axons\nSeveral lines of evidence support the concept that CNS-resident cells and infiltrating immune cells, whether contained within the perivascular spaces or meninges, communicate bidirectionally to both propagate CNS-compartmentalized inflammation and incite damage in the cortical parenchyma. Regarding the compartmentalized immune response, meningeal immune cell collections have been associated with more pronounced perivascular inflammation in the cortex, which may reflect greater meningeal inflammation solicited in response to more perivascular inflammation in the subjacent tissue, or alternatively, may indicate that more meningeal inflammation promotes greater immune cell perivascular infiltration in the underlying cortex via upregulation of certain chemokines and/or adhesion molecules on brain or endothelial cells\nNext, with regard to cortical damage, B cells and other immune cells in the meninges (or in Virchow-Robin spaces) may produce factors that diffuse into the parenchyma and indirectly or directly induce cortical demyelination and neurodegeneration\nNonetheless, the communication between meningeal immune collections and CNS cells is likely bidirectional in that activated cells within the CNS, including microglia, astrocytes, and perivascular infiltrates, signal back to both immune and stromal cells in the meninges to promote lymphocyte retention within the meningeal compartment\nThe literature often refers to relapsing MS disease mechanisms as “inflammatory” and progressive disease mechanisms as “degenerative”. However, the now well-documented association between meningeal inflammation, cortical injury, and clinical progression in MS points to underlying inflammatory mechanisms that may be viable targets for therapeutic intervention in progressive MS. This does not preclude an effort to further study as well as target degenerative disease mechanisms, but suggests that different types of inflammation, playing out in different anatomic compartments, contribute to distinct processes of CNS injury throughout the MS course.\nWith the recent approval of three drugs for the treatment of progressive forms of MS -ocrelizumab for PPMS and siponimod and cladribine for SPMS - it is of interest to consider the mechanisms by which these therapeutic benefits are mediated and, in particular, whether their ability to limit disease progression reflects, at least in part, targeting of CNS-compartmentalized immune responses relevant to cortical injury. A major challenge to establishing this is that each treatment has a robust effect on relapsing MS biology, which would be expected to limit relapse-related progression of disability. Here, we briefly consider how each agent may impact non-relapsing disease mechanisms.\nOcrelizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD20, was shown to have a modest but significant beneficial effect on limiting confirmed disability progression in both RRMS and PPMS patients\nSiponimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, was approved for the treatment of active SPMS\nAs with siponimod, the oral agent cladribine is approved for use in active SPMS patients\nEfforts are ongoing to better understand how current and emerging therapies may beneficially impact both the CNS-compartmentalized immune response and neurodegeneration, wherein therapies could either interfere with detrimental cell processes or promote remyelination and repair of neural elements", "topic": "Neuroinflammation"}
