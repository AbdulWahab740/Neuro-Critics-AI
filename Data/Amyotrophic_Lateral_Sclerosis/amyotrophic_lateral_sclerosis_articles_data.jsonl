Despite extensive research efforts, the exact pathological cascade leading to progressive motor neuron degeneration remains elusive. Recent evidence highlights significant modifications in lipid metabolism during ALS progression, even before the onset of motor symptoms. Glycerophospholipids, the primary components of cellular membranes, are frequently altered in ALS patients and models. These lipids not only play a structural role in membranes, but also contribute to cellular metabolism, signaling pathways, and cell type-specific processes such as neuronal transmission and muscle contraction. In this review, we discuss glycerophospholipid physiological functions in the motor system and review recent studies demonstrating their alterations and the possible underlying pathological mechanisms in ALS.

Remarkably, some changes emerge during the early phase of the disease, suggesting their possible role in initiating neurodegeneration. Furthermore, these alterations persist and evolve at later stages and might exacerbate ALS pathology. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to unravel the mechanistic link between GPL metabolism alterations and neurodegeneration. Future investigations will not only enhance our understanding of ALS pathogenesis but also offer novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive approach involving the joint analysis of multiple models, tissues, ans biofluids will be necessary to reveal the complete fingerprint of GPL alterations in ALS.

Mutated proteins associated with ALS, such as SOD1, TPD-43, FUS, and C9ORF72, interact with mitochondria and accumulate within the organelle, causing defects in respiration and ATP production [\nMAM activity is involved in multiple pathological mechanisms disrupted in ALS, highlighting its potential as a critical hub for neurodegeneration and disease progression [\nUsing a genome-wide screening approach in Drosophila we recently identified Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) as a novel modifier of FUS-ALS pathology [\nIn a therapeutic approach targeting the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) using antisense oligonucleotides or with pharmacological inhibitors (Tubastatin A and ACY-738), we demonstrated the successful rescue of MAM integrity and PC levels in MNs derived from FUS-ALS patient iPSCs [\nPUFAs emerged as promising therapeutic candidates in ALS due to their neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Multiple large epidemiological studies showed that higher dietary intake and plasma levels of specific PUFAs, particularly alpha-linolenic acid, are associated with a lower risk of developing ALS, prolonged survival, and slowed functional decline in patients [\nCurrently, only a limited number of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets related to GPL metabolism were identified, but they certainly hold promise for future research endeavors (Fig.\nLink between GPL functions and ALS pathological mechanisms. Lipidomic analyses of the nervous system, skeletal muscles, and biofluids demonstrated the alterations of GPL metabolism. The perturbation of GPL homeostasis in ALS influences various pathological mechanisms, including inflammation, synaptic transmission, myelin disruption, muscle atrophy, neuromuscular junction dismantlement, membrane properties alterations, oxidative stress, mitochondrial defects, and autophagy dysfunctions. Created with Biorender.com\nLipidomic technologies have made significant advances in recent years, but several challenges persist. The limited availability of isotope-labeled internal standards for all lipid classes prevents accurate quantification and exhaustive mapping of entire lipidomes [\nThe lack of standardized protocols for sample preparation, data acquisition and analysis led to poor cross-platform reproducibility [\nThis variability is further exacerbated by the heterogeneous nature of ALS, where patients exhibit considerable discrepancies in age and site of onset, motor manifestations, degree of frontotemporal involvement, spreading patterns, and disease duration [\nMany existing lipidomic studies suffer from limitations such as small sample sizes (\nIn mice, these factors also influence directly the lipid profile of the animals, in addition to the genetic background. A comparative study of α-synuclein mouse models of Parkinson’s disease revealed age, gender, and gene dosage as factors modifying brain lipid profiles [\nA significant challenge in analyzing lipidomic data from brain tissue lies in the complexity of the samples, which encompass diverse regions and a variety of cell types. Given that glial cells outnumber neurons in most brain areas, the resulting lipid profiles are largely influenced by the glial metabolism. Despite this, the findings are often interpreted in the context of neuronal functions. Recent advances in mass spectrometry technologies enable cellular profiling at unprecedented resolution, down to the level of single cells and even individual organelles, facilitating the identification of cell-type-specific pathological mechanisms associated with lipid metabolism [\nThe cell culture medium also dramatically influences the lipid profile since it is generally not designed to maintain the in vivo cellular lipid composition. Cultured cells are often exposed to high glucose concentrations coupled with a lipid deficit, leading to accelerated rates of lipogenesis and higher rates of\nTo advance the field, it is crucial to validate in vitro lipid-related findings in vivo models and to develop standardized protocols that account for the complex interplay of factors influencing lipidomic profiles in both research and clinical settings.\nIncreasing pre-clinical and clinical data demonstrate consistently the involvement of GPL alterations in ALS disease pathology. Remarkably, some changes emerge during the early phase of the disease, suggesting their possible role in initiating neurodegeneration. Furthermore, these alterations persist and evolve at later stages and might exacerbate ALS pathology. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to unravel the mechanistic link between GPL metabolism alterations and neurodegeneration. Future investigations will not only enhance our understanding of ALS pathogenesis but also offer novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive approach involving the joint analysis of multiple models, tissues, ans biofluids will be necessary to reveal the complete fingerprint of GPL alterations in ALS. In clinical settings, results must be validated across independent large-scale cohorts of patients with standardized procedures to ensure reliability and reproducibility. The recent findings underscore the critical importance of investigating GPLs in greater detail to fully harness their potential in ALS research and treatment.", "topic": "Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis"}

This search identified five studies–four prospective cohort studies and one randomised controlled trial–reporting on the use of riluzole in the context of spinal cord injury (SCI). Pooled results showed a modest, non-significant improvement in American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) motor score at 6 months with riluzole. Two studies also reported trends towards Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) improvement, though not statistically significant. These findings, based on univariate analyses, however, have inherent limitations, particularly for rare or orphan conditions such as SCI. The recently concluded NISCI trial (Nogo Inhibition in SCI) reinforced the interdependence of neurological and functional recovery. This highlights the value of integrated methods like the Global Statistical Test (GST), which can better capture treatment benefit.\nMultidimensional outcome assessment has long been advocated in SCI trials evaluating neuroprotective and neuroregenerative interventions. Yet, more than a decade after recommendations from an expert consensus panel in 2007, adoption of such frameworks remains limited. Our re-analysis of RISCIS data using GST demonstrates a feasible and statistically rigorous approach to assessing integrated clinical outcomes. By estimating a Global Treatment Effect (GTE), GST allows clinicians and stakeholders to determine the likelihood of treatment benefit across neurological, functional, and patient reported quality-of-life outcomes. Rather than relying on isolated endpoints, GST reflects how decisions are made in real-world clinical practice–by synthesising a global impression of patient recovery. This multidimensional lens has the potential to improve the design, interpretation, and clinical relevance of future trials.\nClinical trials in SCI face considerable obstacles, including recruitment difficulty, small sample size, heterogeneity in injury characteristics and recovery trajectory, as well as uncertainty regarding the most appropriate primary endpoint. In this study, we report the first application of GST in SCI research, demonstrating its enhanced ability to detect treatment effects through a multidimensional analytical framework. By integrating multiple outcome measures that trend consistently in favour of riluzole, GST enables a more comprehensive and unified assessment of therapeutic benefit. Our findings show that riluzole is associated with motor improvements that translate into meaningful functional gains and enhanced quality of life in severe SCI. The role of riluzole in acute SCI warrants re-evaluation, and its consideration in future clinical guidelines should be revisited in light of this evidence.\nTranslating spinal cord injury (SCI) research from bench to bedside remains a formidable challenge. Despite decades of clinical trials, no FDA-approved treatment has conclusively demonstrated effectiveness in mitigating secondary injury to the spinal cord and improving functional outcome. SCI clinical trial challenges are similar to those in traumatic brain injury, including being underpowered due to recruitment difficulties and unclear definitions of appropriate follow-up and suitable trial endpoints.\nPhase III clinical trials are focused on a primary endpoint based on FDA guidelines to assess intervention superiority compared to placebo or standard of care controls. However, SCI trial success should not be defined on one metric alone as this does not represent patients' defined success. Evaluating efficacy requires consideration of multiple outcomes due to patients' varied values and their impacts on their individual lives. Thus, analysis evaluating multiple endpoints provides for a more thorough evaluation of intervention effectiveness and enhances the trial's ability to detect genuine effects statistically.\nThe RISCIS Trial (Safety and Efficacy of Riluzole in Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study), reported in 2023, highlights the potential limitations of relying exclusively on a singular study endpoint. Despite being unable to achieve statistical significance in its primary outcome of upper extremity motor score (UEMS) improvement and being prematurely terminated due to sponsor withdrawal during the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial demonstrated efficacy across various secondary endpoints.\nSelecting the most appropriate method for analysing data on multiple endpoints depends on various factors, including study design, objectives, and endpoint characteristics. Commonly used multiple comparison tests, such as Bonferroni correction, Holm's step-down,\nGlobal statistical tests (GSTs) address these issues by providing a single, unified statistical test to determine whether the new treatment is preferable to the control based on multiple equally important endpoints.\nIn this study, the GST approach was used to better represent the overall treatment impact of riluzole using data from the RISCIS trial.\nWe utilised data from the RISCIS trial to investigate the properties of the GST. The study design and primary results of the trial have been reported elsewhere.\nThe original RISCIS trial was approved by institutional review boards at each participating site, and all patients provided written informed consent before enrolment.\nTo integrate information from various outcomes and determine whether a treatment confers a global benefit, O'Brien (1984) introduced two least square-based tests and a rank-sum type test, collectively known as global statistical tests (GSTs). However, the least square-based GSTs have been criticised as “untenable” when some endpoints are negatively correlated.\nConsider a randomised clinical trial with\nA statistical test is developed to determine if a hypothesised statement is likely to be supported by the observed data. Mathematically, the hypothesis is represented by an expression involving a parameter. For example, the hypothesis of a one-sided two-sample t-test is δ > c or δ < c, where the parameter δ represents the difference in mean values between the two comparison groups, and c is a pre-specified constant. GTE is a parameter introduced by Huang et al. to measure treatment superiority when\nWhen analysing only a single continuous outcome, testing GTE is equivalent to testing the parameter\nIf the probability of tied outcomes is low, say\nIn contrast, if tied outcomes are frequent, say\nThis ambiguity introduced by ties does not happen to the GTE from Huang et al. The net probability difference\nGTE ranges from −1 to 1. As a nonparametric measure, its value remains unaffected by the measurement scale. Unlike effect size measures (e.g., standardised mean difference), which can be changed after data transformations (such as log transformations), GTE maintains its consistency. Since it is a probability-based measure, GTE does not strictly quantify magnitude of treatment difference but rather answers the important question “what is the chance that a patient will improve more on riluzole than on placebo” by giving a probability estimate.\nThe treatment preference can be mathematically represented by the value of the GTE. Specifically, GTE = 0 implies no preference between treatment and control; a positive GTE indicates that the treatment is globally better than the control, and a negative GTE suggests that the control is globally better than the treatment. Larger positive GTE values correspond to stronger treatment preference. Therefore, hypotheses for no global preference, treatment preference, and control preference can be mathematically expressed as follows:\nNo global preference: GTE = 0\nTreatment preferred: GTE > 0\nControl preferred: GTE < 0\nGTE can be estimated using formula:\nAs GTE is an average of individual\nThe primary outcome in this GST analysis was a composite of three measurement scales:\nThe six-month change (final minus baseline) was calculated for each outcome scale. Since higher values for all three outcomes indicated better results, the requirement for applying the GST was fulfilled and further data processing was not needed.\nWe obtained GST estimates using R Statistical Software (version 4.2.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Continuous data were listed as means and standard deviations (SD), while categorical variables were described as counts and percentages. Scatterplots and forest plots were generated using the ‘ggplot2’ package. The significance level was set at 0.025 (one-sided), in alignment with the original RISCIS trial protocol.\nNo funding was received for the present work. No funding body had any role in study design, data collection, data analyses, interpretation, or writing of this report.\nA total of 131 patients were included in the modified complete case RISCIS cohort, with a mean age of 45.8 years and 82% being male. Among these, 66 out of the 69 patients originally randomised to placebo and 65 out of the 68 patients in the riluzole group had available imputed data for the three outcome scales at six months. The baseline distribution of covariates was generally well-balanced between the two groups (\nBaseline demographic and clinical characteristics in the modified complete case population of the RISCIS\nAIS—ASIA Impairment Scale; SCIM—Spinal Cord Independence Measure; SF-36 PCS—Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Score.\nThe GST analysis using the three outcome scales in the complete SCI cohort (n = 131) revealed a median rank sum of 207 (IQR: 166–246) for the riluzole group and 185 (IQR: 146–236) for the placebo group.

However, due to smaller sample sizes in these subgroups, the GST did not detect statistically significant differences between riluzole and placebo groups (AIS B: t-statistics = 0.6951, df = 25, p = 0.26; AIS C: t-statistics = 0.1583, df = 37, p = 0.44) (\nIn this analysis of the RISCIS randomised controlled trial data, the GST approach revealed a significant improvement in global outcomes with riluzole treatment. Riluzole-treated patients with SCI demonstrated a higher median rank sum on a composite outcome measure encompassing motor function, functional capacity, and quality of life, indicating a small-to-medium treatment effect size. This study pioneers the application of GST methodology to an SCI trial, highlighting the established benefits of combining endpoints for a comprehensive assessment of multiple outcome scales in a cohesive analysis.\nThe GST approach evaluates the hypothesis of treatment superiority by simultaneously assessing multiple endpoints.\nGST's effectiveness depends on the careful selection of its component scales. While there is no consensus on the most optimal outcomes tool for SCI research, there is broad agreement on the necessity of a multidimensional approach that aligns with patient-reported priorities.\nIndividual measurement scales are unsuitable for independent assessment because certain interventions may disproportionately improve one aspect while others may not be sensitive to therapeutic drug interventions.\nGST effectively captures the heterogeneity of patients with SCI in clinical trials, summarising treatment effects in a clinically meaningful and powerful analysis. By identifying significant results using a broad array of patient outcomes with riluzole, GST allows for better evaluation of its efficacy and enhances the understanding of its beneficial impact across multiple recovery areas, in contrast to the conventional single endpoint analysis currently perpetuated for regulatory approval.\nRiluzole modulates glutaminergic neurotransmission, reducing excitotoxicity, a key secondary injury mechanism in SCI.\nOur study has some limitations, including the post hoc nature of the data analysis. Additionally, the threshold for the GTE that reflects a clinically meaningful change to clearly delineate spontaneous neurological recovery from that of riluzole treatment remains undefined. Nevertheless, a statistically significant higher GTE value indicates a beneficial treatment signal in riluzole-treated patients with AIS A injuries. While the present analysis treats outcomes equally in statistical rank-based comparisons, in practise, their clinical impact differs. Specifically, TOTM may be valued differently than improvement in functional or perceived well-being depending on clinical context. While not equally “weighted” in clinical relevance, the GST provides a method to synthesise changes across these domains. GST is applicable to all types of continuous and ordinal outcomes as far as each of them can be ranked … Additionally, while the GTE provides a valuable summary measure, it represents a probabilistic estimate of overall benefit, rather than a direct quantification of treatment magnitude, offering a clinically interpretable yet distinct perspective on treatment efficacy. If magnitude-based comparisons are needed, they can be conducted on individual outcome components, as we have shown in our results. Despite these limitations, our study has several strengths, including the use of data derived from a large randomised multicentre clinical trial with prospectively and blindly evaluated outcomes, minimising bias. The selection of outcomes scales followed consensus guidelines in SCI research, reducing endpoint selection bias.\nThis patient-centric analysis of the RISCIS trial with the GST approach noted a significant treatment benefit with riluzole, demonstrated by simultaneous improvement in neurological, functional, and quality of life outcomes among severe cervical patients with SCI at six months. Riluzole, with its neuroprotective properties, established safety profile, and ease of administration, may be a viable therapeutic option in SCI; however, additional high-quality studies are needed to substantiate this potential. GST provides a probabilistic estimate of the likelihood that treatment yields better outcomes across multiple domains, rather than quantifying the absolute magnitude of benefit. Its value lies in integrating diverse endpoints to capture the complexity of patient outcomes, which is a key methodological challenge in SCI research. Careful selection of clinically meaningful outcomes is crucial to ensure that GST-derived probabilities reflect improvements with true clinical and patient-centred relevance.\nConception and design: MGF, KMP.\nAcquisition of data: MGF, AM, JSH, RS, JB, BA, PMA, JDG, SNK, JMS, ANN, KMS, FUA, AY, WZR, NPB, JW, DSB, DSLC, EGT, JRW.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: PH, JH, KET, KMP, MAA.\nStatistical analysis: PH, JH, KMP, MAA.\nDrafting of the manuscript: KMP, PH, MGF, MAA.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: MGF, JSH, RS, JB, BA, PMA, JDG, SNK, JMS, ANN, KMS, FUA, AY, WZR, NPB, JRW, JW, DSB, DSLC, EGT.\nObtaining funding: MGF.\nAdministrative, technical or material support: MGF.\nSupervision: MGF, KET, PH.\nAll authors have read and approved the final version of the manuscript.\nMGF and KMP accessed and verified the underlying data.\nDeidentified data available from the corresponding author Dr. Michael Fehlings upon reasonable request—\nThe authors have no relevant conflicts to disclose.

This search identified five studies–four prospective cohort studies and one randomised controlled trial–reporting on the use of riluzole in the context of spinal cord injury (SCI). Pooled results showed a modest, non-significant improvement in American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) motor score at 6 months with riluzole. Two studies also reported trends towards Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) improvement, though not statistically significant. These findings, based on univariate analyses, however, have inherent limitations, particularly for rare or orphan conditions such as SCI. The recently concluded NISCI trial (Nogo Inhibition in SCI) reinforced the interdependence of neurological and functional recovery. This highlights the value of integrated methods like the Global Statistical Test (GST), which can better capture treatment benefit.\nMultidimensional outcome assessment has long been advocated in SCI trials evaluating neuroprotective and neuroregenerative interventions. Yet, more than a decade after recommendations from an expert consensus panel in 2007, adoption of such frameworks remains limited. Our re-analysis of RISCIS data using GST demonstrates a feasible and statistically rigorous approach to assessing integrated clinical outcomes. By estimating a Global Treatment Effect (GTE), GST allows clinicians and stakeholders to determine the likelihood of treatment benefit across neurological, functional, and patient reported quality-of-life outcomes. Rather than relying on isolated endpoints, GST reflects how decisions are made in real-world clinical practice–by synthesising a global impression of patient recovery. This multidimensional lens has the potential to improve the design, interpretation, and clinical relevance of future trials.\nClinical trials in SCI face considerable obstacles, including recruitment difficulty, small sample size, heterogeneity in injury characteristics and recovery trajectory, as well as uncertainty regarding the most appropriate primary endpoint. In this study, we report the first application of GST in SCI research, demonstrating its enhanced ability to detect treatment effects through a multidimensional analytical framework. By integrating multiple outcome measures that trend consistently in favour of riluzole, GST enables a more comprehensive and unified assessment of therapeutic benefit. Our findings show that riluzole is associated with motor improvements that translate into meaningful functional gains and enhanced quality of life in severe SCI. The role of riluzole in acute SCI warrants re-evaluation, and its consideration in future clinical guidelines should be revisited in light of this evidence.\nTranslating spinal cord injury (SCI) research from bench to bedside remains a formidable challenge. Despite decades of clinical trials, no FDA-approved treatment has conclusively demonstrated effectiveness in mitigating secondary injury to the spinal cord and improving functional outcome. SCI clinical trial challenges are similar to those in traumatic brain injury, including being underpowered due to recruitment difficulties and unclear definitions of appropriate follow-up and suitable trial endpoints.\nPhase III clinical trials are focused on a primary endpoint based on FDA guidelines to assess intervention superiority compared to placebo or standard of care controls. However, SCI trial success should not be defined on one metric alone as this does not represent patients' defined success. Evaluating efficacy requires consideration of multiple outcomes due to patients' varied values and their impacts on their individual lives. Thus, analysis evaluating multiple endpoints provides for a more thorough evaluation of intervention effectiveness and enhances the trial's ability to detect genuine effects statistically.\nThe RISCIS Trial (Safety and Efficacy of Riluzole in Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study), reported in 2023, highlights the potential limitations of relying exclusively on a singular study endpoint. Despite being unable to achieve statistical significance in its primary outcome of upper extremity motor score (UEMS) improvement and being prematurely terminated due to sponsor withdrawal during the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial demonstrated efficacy across various secondary endpoints.\nSelecting the most appropriate method for analysing data on multiple endpoints depends on various factors, including study design, objectives, and endpoint characteristics. Commonly used multiple comparison tests, such as Bonferroni correction, Holm's step-down,\nGlobal statistical tests (GSTs) address these issues by providing a single, unified statistical test to determine whether the new treatment is preferable to the control based on multiple equally important endpoints.\nIn this study, the GST approach was used to better represent the overall treatment impact of riluzole using data from the RISCIS trial.\nWe utilised data from the RISCIS trial to investigate the properties of the GST. The study design and primary results of the trial have been reported elsewhere.\nThe original RISCIS trial was approved by institutional review boards at each participating site, and all patients provided written informed consent before enrolment.\nTo integrate information from various outcomes and determine whether a treatment confers a global benefit, O'Brien (1984) introduced two least square-based tests and a rank-sum type test, collectively known as global statistical tests (GSTs). However, the least square-based GSTs have been criticised as “untenable” when some endpoints are negatively correlated.\nConsider a randomised clinical trial with\nA statistical test is developed to determine if a hypothesised statement is likely to be supported by the observed data. Mathematically, the hypothesis is represented by an expression involving a parameter. For example, the hypothesis of a one-sided two-sample t-test is δ > c or δ < c, where the parameter δ represents the difference in mean values between the two comparison groups, and c is a pre-specified constant. GTE is a parameter introduced by Huang et al. to measure treatment superiority when\nWhen analysing only a single continuous outcome, testing GTE is equivalent to testing the parameter\nIf the probability of tied outcomes is low, say\nIn contrast, if tied outcomes are frequent, say\nThis ambiguity introduced by ties does not happen to the GTE from Huang et al. The net probability difference\nGTE ranges from −1 to 1. As a nonparametric measure, its value remains unaffected by the measurement scale. Unlike effect size measures (e.g., standardised mean difference), which can be changed after data transformations (such as log transformations), GTE maintains its consistency. Since it is a probability-based measure, GTE does not strictly quantify magnitude of treatment difference but rather answers the important question “what is the chance that a patient will improve more on riluzole than on placebo” by giving a probability estimate.\nThe treatment preference can be mathematically represented by the value of the GTE. Specifically, GTE = 0 implies no preference between treatment and control; a positive GTE indicates that the treatment is globally better than the control, and a negative GTE suggests that the control is globally better than the treatment. Larger positive GTE values correspond to stronger treatment preference. Therefore, hypotheses for no global preference, treatment preference, and control preference can be mathematically expressed as follows:\nNo global preference: GTE = 0\nTreatment preferred: GTE > 0\nControl preferred: GTE < 0\nGTE can be estimated using formula:\nAs GTE is an average of individual\nThe primary outcome in this GST analysis was a composite of three measurement scales:\nThe six-month change (final minus baseline) was calculated for each outcome scale. Since higher values for all three outcomes indicated better results, the requirement for applying the GST was fulfilled and further data processing was not needed.\nWe obtained GST estimates using R Statistical Software (version 4.2.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Continuous data were listed as means and standard deviations (SD), while categorical variables were described as counts and percentages. Scatterplots and forest plots were generated using the ‘ggplot2’ package.

Among these, 66 out of the 69 patients originally randomised to placebo and 65 out of the 68 patients in the riluzole group had available imputed data for the three outcome scales at six months.

Consequently, the associated electronic health records (EHR) are often unstructured and complex, posing challenges for systematic data analysis.Methods and procedures: In this study, we employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to automatically analyze clinical narratives and extract diagnostic information from a diverse set of EHRs. Our dataset includes medical records from 486 patients, representing a group with diverse dysphagic conditions. We analyze diagnoses provided in unstructured free text that do not follow a standardized structure. We utilize clustering algorithms on the extracted diagnostic features to identify distinct groups of patients who share similar pathophysiological swallowing dysfunctions.Results: We found that basic NLP techniques often provide limited insights due to the high variability of the data. In contrast, LLMs help to bridge the gap in understanding the nuanced medical information about dysphagia and related conditions. Although applying these advanced LLM models is not straightforward, our results demonstrate that leveraging closed-source models can effectively cluster different categories of dysphagia.Conclusion: Our study provides therefore evidence that LLMs are highly promising in future dysphagia research.Clinical impact: Dysphagia is a symptom associated with various diseases, though its underlying relationships remain unclear. This study demonstrates how analyzing large volumes of electronic health records can help clarify the causes of dysphagia and identify contributing factors. By applying natural language processing, we aim to enhance both understanding and treatment, supporting clinical staff in improving individualized care by identifying relevant patient cohorts.

However, one of the challenges in the medical literature and patient-associated reports lies in the diverse and sometimes inconsistent terminology and abbreviations used to describe similar pathological conditions. This problem is especially evident in the area of dysphagia, where various terms may describe the same or similar clinical situations. Dysphagia refers to any difficulty in swallowing, involving the transport of food or liquids from the mouth to the stomach. These difficulties may impact sensory or motor functions during the swallowing process. Therefore, dysphagia is more a symptom, associated with a range of underlying diseases, than a standalone diagnosis\nData mining in EHRs is a common strategy to understand the course of diseases. In contrast to the structured nature of, for instance, blood parameters, unstructured free text information is harder to analyze. Hence, research focuses on exploring NLP and LLMs for this task, which has been shown promising: improving patient outcomes\nLLMs have shown significant promise in extracting and summarizing key information from unstructured clinical texts. Models such as FLAN-T5 and Mistral-Instruct have been tailored for medical applications by training on extensive datasets of medical literature and clinical notes\nHowever, the application of NLP and LLMs in the broad area of dysphagia is largely underexplored. NLP methods have been utilized to analyze esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedures, as outlined by recent work (e.g.,\nIn the broader sense, the analysis of EHRs from dysphagia patients with machine learning tools could identify dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia\nThe study analyzes a comprehensive, fully anonymized, monocentric EHR dataset comprising only dysphagic pathological cases. Among other detailed information, the patient’s records of interest are stored in unstructured free text and cover diagnostic information as well as symptomatic reports of the patient. We want to analyze whether there are similarities between dysphagic patients stored in the EHR, i.e., by similar diagnoses, and summarize them on this basis.\nOur EHR dataset consists of 486 dysphagic patients, who all reported dysphagic symptoms or were diagnosed with dysphagia and presented for instrumental swallowing assessment. The dataset contains information about the patient’s year of birth, age, gender, race, ethnicity, category of the disease primarily responsible for the patient’s dysphagia, medical diagnoses associated with the instrumental exam of the visit, medications, comorbidities, number of videofluoroscopy studies, and whether the person received a service from a speech-language pathologist (SLP) or not. The patients were all treated and recorded at the clinic Our Lady Of The Lake in Baton Rouge, USA. All data were acquired in accordance with IRBAM-21-0625. Additionally, the data was labeled by two experienced SLP experts, who agreed on one category for the patient’s source of dysphagia is neurogenic, neurodegenerative, cancer, and none of the aforementioned. Since a patient may have more than one diagnosis, we manually categorized the main cause of the patient’s presentation into one of the four categories. In this study, we only use the information about the associated medical diagnoses, which is written in unstructured free text. This implies that this information varies in length, level of detail, and information content. To verify the categorization ability of our NLP algorithms, we use the information about the manually labeled category from our medical experts as ground truth.\nNLP incorporates techniques to understand human languages, which can range from simple counting techniques to semantic parsing\nLLMs demonstrate strong performance in NLP tasks due to their architecture, which enables them to capture long-distance relationships. Their training on large datasets establishes a comprehensive knowledge base that these models can effectively utilize\nAn overview of the process including two approaches of mining the text information of the patient diagnoses. The first approach only covers the preprocessing of the text data and uses the embeddings for clustering. In the second stream, we add an LLM and cluster based on the LLM-generated output.\nFirst prompt to categorize dysphagic patients in neurogenic, neurodegenerative, cancer, or none of the aforementioned categories.\nSecond prompt to categorize dysphagic patients by including a definition for each category.\nThe dataset used in this study comprises records from 486 patients, each presenting a variety of pathological impairments. Since the diagnoses are presented as unstructured free text, there is high variability in their formulation. To familiarize ourselves with the data, we initially analyzed its structural properties. We analyzed these diagnoses by examining the total number of words and characters, as well as the structural format of the diagnostic text, as shown in\nAnalysis of our dataset, specifically of the associated medical diagnoses. a) represents the number of patients sharing the same number of words for the diagnoses. b) shows the variety of characters a diagnosis can contain. c) describes the number of patients, who share the symptom GERD in their diagnoses at any but also on the relative position in the text.\nTo enhance our understanding of the recorded data, we employed various text embedding techniques, including three variants of BERT and one W2V model. These embeddings convert the preprocessed medical texts into mathematical vectors that represent the textual data, where one dot in\nAnalysis of the clustering ability of the patient’s diagnoses of four different embeddings after applying UMAP for dimensionality reduction and DBSCAN for class assignment. a) represents the text-to-vector conversion done with CB, b) with MB, c) with BERT, and d) with a W2V approach.\nCorrelation matrix of the IoU score of patients among the clusters of different embeddings. Each clustered group was used to calculate the IoU with all of the other embeddings.\nThe text-based clustering approach showed limited correlation among the clusters, which is why we asked if we could enhance the output of the embeddings and leverage their full potential. To improve the distinguishability of different dysphagic pathologies through the embeddings, we incorporated a cognitive preprocessing stage to enhance the quality of the input data. Consequently, we used the patients’ primary associated diagnoses as input for four distinct LLMs. The LLMs present summarized versions of the patient’s symptoms and diagnoses by prioritizing primary impairments. Therefore, we utilized three open-source LLMs: Llama2, PMC, Mixtral, and one proprietary, continually refined LLM, namely GPT from OpenAI.\nAnalysis of diagnoses output generated with 4 different LLM models (Llama2, PMC, Mixtral and GPT). The cluster were build with UMAP after applying CB embedding.\nCorrelation matrix of the IoU score of patients among the clusters of different LLMs. Each clustered group was used to calculate the IoU with all of the other clusters of the LLMs.\nThe evaluation of the preprocessing method, particularly the diagnoses summarization, proved some effect for the closed-source LLM but showed huge disparities among other LLMs. This observation suggests that the efficacy of clustering may be hindered by inconsistencies in the integration of dysphagic diagnoses across LLMs, as well as the diversity of diagnoses themselves. Consequently, we aimed to categorize patients based on their primary associated disease, particularly focusing on what likely caused dysphagia symptoms. Here, we delineated four primary categories: neurogenic, neurodegenerative, cancer, and other for patients not fitting into the aforementioned categories. A ground truth was generated by experts. First, we tasked our LLMs with generating a category following the first prompt, as detailed in\nAnalysis of the categories neurogenic, neurodegenerative, and all others assigned by the four different LLMs (Llama2, PMC, Mixtral, and GPT) based on the patient’s medical diagnoses. a) to d) present the performance of the respective LLMs to categorize without additional prior knowledge and fine-tuning of the models. e) to f) show the performance of the model including definitions for the single categories to support the category decision.\nThe limited ability of LLMs to differentiate between neurogenic and neurodegenerative diagnoses led us to investigate whether adding category definitions to the prompt, as shown in\nProviding category definitions did not significantly enhance performance. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the number of similarly categorized patients to establish a primary categorization.

Future studies could investigate specific attributes that improve patient differentiation and thus improve both within-class and between-class categorization.\nWe found that embeddings solely were not powerful enough to distinguish dysphagic patients into distinct and meaningful groups. LLMs were also not able to identify relationships between diagnoses to enhance patient information, which made diagnosis clustering challenging. To address this, we adopted a category-based clustering approach, where explicitly medical-trained LLMs could not compete with closed-source models.\nLLMs are not yet mature enough to be applied lightly to medical data, as they are still challenged by the different terminology and abbreviations used in medical diagnoses. Our analysis showed that clustering methods by leveraging embeddings could be applied to free unstructured data, but it did not yield clear distinctions between different underlying pathologies. This may be due to the multiple diagnoses associated with dysphagia\nTo overcome the limitations of embeddings, we used LLMs (i) to preprocess diagnoses by filling in missing understanding and (ii) to assign categorizations. In both approaches, the LLMs showed different degrees of drifting focus in text generation\nThe answers vary greatly between the models and in some cases no longer have anything to do with the task. This limited performance is partly due to the fundamental complexity of the medical data but is also known to be a general limitation of LLMs. This phenomenon is commonly known as hallucination in the context of large language models (LLMs). It occurs when the model generates information that cannot be verified by reliable sources or that has no factual basis in the training data\nFollowing a disease-specific clustering by using NLP as well as more sophisticated language processing using LLMs showed weak performance. Category-driven decision-making approaches with LLMs rather showed promising results, particularly for the closed-source model GPT. This shows that LLMs can be used for mining EHR and downstream applications but under very limited circumstances due to hallucination.\nCui et al. show the integration of a collaborative approach in the disease prediction task of the LLM. This covers an agent approach, which consists of two parts: to learn from its mistakes and to adapt to the challenges of the medical data\nShi et al. additionally propose the EHR-Agent, which enriches the learning and guiding approach of LLMs by including a long-term memory to learn from the past\nHowever, the most important aspect that needs to be improved when applying LLMs in a medical context is the limitation of the hallucination factor. One form of addressing this problem is shown in\nThis and further future advancements in LLMs and their expanding capabilities present an opportunity to handle EHR data more efficiently. This will be crucial as medical big data, particularly EHRs, continues to grow, necessitating robust tools for data analysis and categorization.

Hence, research focuses on exploring NLP and LLMs for this task, which has been shown promising: improving patient outcomes\nLLMs have shown significant promise in extracting and summarizing key information from unstructured clinical texts. Models such as FLAN-T5 and Mistral-Instruct have been tailored for medical applications by training on extensive datasets of medical literature and clinical notes\nHowever, the application of NLP and LLMs in the broad area of dysphagia is largely underexplored. NLP methods have been utilized to analyze esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedures, as outlined by recent work (e.g.,\nIn the broader sense, the analysis of EHRs from dysphagia patients with machine learning tools could identify dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia\nThe study analyzes a comprehensive, fully anonymized, monocentric EHR dataset comprising only dysphagic pathological cases. Among other detailed information, the patient’s records of interest are stored in unstructured free text and cover diagnostic information as well as symptomatic reports of the patient. We want to analyze whether there are similarities between dysphagic patients stored in the EHR, i.e., by similar diagnoses, and summarize them on this basis.\nOur EHR dataset consists of 486 dysphagic patients, who all reported dysphagic symptoms or were diagnosed with dysphagia and presented for instrumental swallowing assessment. The dataset contains information about the patient’s year of birth, age, gender, race, ethnicity, category of the disease primarily responsible for the patient’s dysphagia, medical diagnoses associated with the instrumental exam of the visit, medications, comorbidities, number of videofluoroscopy studies, and whether the person received a service from a speech-language pathologist (SLP) or not. The patients were all treated and recorded at the clinic Our Lady Of The Lake in Baton Rouge, USA. All data were acquired in accordance with IRBAM-21-0625. Additionally, the data was labeled by two experienced SLP experts, who agreed on one category for the patient’s source of dysphagia is neurogenic, neurodegenerative, cancer, and none of the aforementioned. Since a patient may have more than one diagnosis, we manually categorized the main cause of the patient’s presentation into one of the four categories. In this study, we only use the information about the associated medical diagnoses, which is written in unstructured free text. This implies that this information varies in length, level of detail, and information content. To verify the categorization ability of our NLP algorithms, we use the information about the manually labeled category from our medical experts as ground truth.\nNLP incorporates techniques to understand human languages, which can range from simple counting techniques to semantic parsing\nLLMs demonstrate strong performance in NLP tasks due to their architecture, which enables them to capture long-distance relationships. Their training on large datasets establishes a comprehensive knowledge base that these models can effectively utilize\nAn overview of the process including two approaches of mining the text information of the patient diagnoses. The first approach only covers the preprocessing of the text data and uses the embeddings for clustering. In the second stream, we add an LLM and cluster based on the LLM-generated output.\nFirst prompt to categorize dysphagic patients in neurogenic, neurodegenerative, cancer, or none of the aforementioned categories.\nSecond prompt to categorize dysphagic patients by including a definition for each category.\nThe dataset used in this study comprises records from 486 patients, each presenting a variety of pathological impairments. Since the diagnoses are presented as unstructured free text, there is high variability in their formulation. To familiarize ourselves with the data, we initially analyzed its structural properties. We analyzed these diagnoses by examining the total number of words and characters, as well as the structural format of the diagnostic text, as shown in\nAnalysis of our dataset, specifically of the associated medical diagnoses. a) represents the number of patients sharing the same number of words for the diagnoses. b) shows the variety of characters a diagnosis can contain. c) describes the number of patients, who share the symptom GERD in their diagnoses at any but also on the relative position in the text.\nTo enhance our understanding of the recorded data, we employed various text embedding techniques, including three variants of BERT and one W2V model. These embeddings convert the preprocessed medical texts into mathematical vectors that represent the textual data, where one dot in\nAnalysis of the clustering ability of the patient’s diagnoses of four different embeddings after applying UMAP for dimensionality reduction and DBSCAN for class assignment. a) represents the text-to-vector conversion done with CB, b) with MB, c) with BERT, and d) with a W2V approach.\nCorrelation matrix of the IoU score of patients among the clusters of different embeddings. Each clustered group was used to calculate the IoU with all of the other embeddings.\nThe text-based clustering approach showed limited correlation among the clusters, which is why we asked if we could enhance the output of the embeddings and leverage their full potential. To improve the distinguishability of different dysphagic pathologies through the embeddings, we incorporated a cognitive preprocessing stage to enhance the quality of the input data. Consequently, we used the patients’ primary associated diagnoses as input for four distinct LLMs. The LLMs present summarized versions of the patient’s symptoms and diagnoses by prioritizing primary impairments. Therefore, we utilized three open-source LLMs: Llama2, PMC, Mixtral, and one proprietary, continually refined LLM, namely GPT from OpenAI.\nAnalysis of diagnoses output generated with 4 different LLM models (Llama2, PMC, Mixtral and GPT). The cluster were build with UMAP after applying CB embedding.\nCorrelation matrix of the IoU score of patients among the clusters of different LLMs. Each clustered group was used to calculate the IoU with all of the other clusters of the LLMs.\nThe evaluation of the preprocessing method, particularly the diagnoses summarization, proved some effect for the closed-source LLM but showed huge disparities among other LLMs. This observation suggests that the efficacy of clustering may be hindered by inconsistencies in the integration of dysphagic diagnoses across LLMs, as well as the diversity of diagnoses themselves. Consequently, we aimed to categorize patients based on their primary associated disease, particularly focusing on what likely caused dysphagia symptoms. Here, we delineated four primary categories: neurogenic, neurodegenerative, cancer, and other for patients not fitting into the aforementioned categories. A ground truth was generated by experts. First, we tasked our LLMs with generating a category following the first prompt, as detailed in\nAnalysis of the categories neurogenic, neurodegenerative, and all others assigned by the four different LLMs (Llama2, PMC, Mixtral, and GPT) based on the patient’s medical diagnoses. a) to d) present the performance of the respective LLMs to categorize without additional prior knowledge and fine-tuning of the models. e) to f) show the performance of the model including definitions for the single categories to support the category decision.\nThe limited ability of LLMs to differentiate between neurogenic and neurodegenerative diagnoses led us to investigate whether adding category definitions to the prompt, as shown in\nProviding category definitions did not significantly enhance performance. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the number of similarly categorized patients to establish a primary categorization. In\nAnalysis of the categorization ability of dysphagia diagnoses into other, neurogenic, neurodegenerative, and cancer of four different LLMs, e.g., Llama2, PMC, Mixtral and GPT.\nAnalysis of the categorization ability of dysphagia diagnoses into other, neurogenic, neurodegenerative, and cancer against ground truth (gt, i.e., classification of our medical experts). The overlap of the LLMs and the ground truth is measured using the IoU.\nIn this study, we explored different approaches for mining EHR data, e.g., dysphagic diagnoses, initially using so-called embeddings alone and later with cognitive preprocessing through LLMs.\nThe data attributes were limited to the information provided, and so we did not include additional details about the patients’ underlying conditions in our study. Future studies could investigate specific attributes that improve patient differentiation and thus improve both within-class and between-class categorization.\nWe found that embeddings solely were not powerful enough to distinguish dysphagic patients into distinct and meaningful groups. LLMs were also not able to identify relationships between diagnoses to enhance patient information, which made diagnosis clustering challenging. To address this, we adopted a category-based clustering approach, where explicitly medical-trained LLMs could not compete with closed-source models.\nLLMs are not yet mature enough to be applied lightly to medical data, as they are still challenged by the different terminology and abbreviations used in medical diagnoses. Our analysis showed that clustering methods by leveraging embeddings could be applied to free unstructured data, but it did not yield clear distinctions between different underlying pathologies. This may be due to the multiple diagnoses associated with dysphagia\nTo overcome the limitations of embeddings, we used LLMs (i) to preprocess diagnoses by filling in missing understanding and (ii) to assign categorizations. In both approaches, the LLMs showed different degrees of drifting focus in text generation\nThe answers vary greatly between the models and in some cases no longer have anything to do with the task. This limited performance is partly due to the fundamental complexity of the medical data but is also known to be a general limitation of LLMs. This phenomenon is commonly known as hallucination in the context of large language models (LLMs). It occurs when the model generates information that cannot be verified by reliable sources or that has no factual basis in the training data\nFollowing a disease-specific clustering by using NLP as well as more sophisticated language processing using LLMs showed weak performance. Category-driven decision-making approaches with LLMs rather showed promising results, particularly for the closed-source model GPT. This shows that LLMs can be used for mining EHR and downstream applications but under very limited circumstances due to hallucination.\nCui et al. show the integration of a collaborative approach in the disease prediction task of the LLM. This covers an agent approach, which consists of two parts: to learn from its mistakes and to adapt to the challenges of the medical data\nShi et al. additionally propose the EHR-Agent, which enriches the learning and guiding approach of LLMs by including a long-term memory to learn from the past\nHowever, the most important aspect that needs to be improved when applying LLMs in a medical context is the limitation of the hallucination factor. One form of addressing this problem is shown in\nThis and further future advancements in LLMs and their expanding capabilities present an opportunity to handle EHR data more efficiently. This will be crucial as medical big data, particularly EHRs, continues to grow, necessitating robust tools for data analysis and categorization. Such tools could enhance treatment strategies for dysphagic patient cohorts and other groups.", "topic": "Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis"}

The disease manifests with progressive muscle weakness and wasting in both upper and lower limbs, along with bulbar involvement leading to dysarthria and dysphagia. Eventually, it leads to respiratory failure, typically resulting in death within 2 to 3 years following diagnosis. The median survival period ranges from 1.5 to 4 years,\nThe mechanism underlying degeneration of motor neurons in ALS remains unclear; however, oxidative stress has been widely accepted to play a prominent role. Various other contributing mechanisms include accumulation of intranuclear and cytoplasmic protein and RNA aggregates, impairments in protein degradation pathways, defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanisms, mitochondrial function impairment, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and altered excitability of neurons that disrupt axonal transport associated with motor degeneration. However, excessive oxidative stress reduces the capability of regeneration and scavenging properties and has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of ALS.\nFurthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause genetic mutations by changing the actions of superoxide dismutase and glutamate synthetase\nMany drugs gained insight in delaying the progression and improving the survival span, Riluzole is one.

Patients with clinically definitive/probable ALS were extensively worked up for ruling out mimics, through medical records and family history. A physical examination as a part of the neurologic work-up, along with neuroimaging and relevant blood laboratory workup of cerebrospina fluid (CSF) analysis including autoimmune and paraneoplastic profile were analysed in relevant cases. Electromyography (EMG) confirming LMN signs consisted of neurogenic potentials, incomplete interference pattern and presence of spontaneous activities such as fasciculations and fibrillations. The Patients were divided based on the onset of clinical symptoms into limb-onset, bulbar-onset and respiratory onset types.\nThey were grouped into patients that received IV Edaravone therapy (cases) and those who did not receive Edaravone therapy (controls). They were matched for similarities with respect to demographic and clinical parameters including race, age, region, sex, duration of illness, Riluzole prescription, ventilation support (invasive/non-invasive) and all-cause hospitalisation.

ALSFRS-R scores were calculated at baseline and post IV Edaravone treatment after each cycle. This was also done for the non-Edaravone group.\nThe scores were calculated at the same time when the intervention group received Edaravone and were compared. The difference in longevity (survival rate) were also compared and analysed. These details were retrieved from the medical records.\nOut of the 62 patients of ALS enrolled, 50 patients of clinically definite/probable ALS were matched for baseline characteristics at 1 month of the diagnosis. They were selected based on 25 in each group (IV Edaravone therapy group and non-IV Edaravone therapy group) (\nALS patients’ phenotype was grouped as limb onset/bulbar onset or respiratory onset. Symptom severity was compared between the ALS patients who were administered IV Edaravone therapy and those who did not receive IV Edaravone therapy, using the ALSFRS score, which was applied at the baseline in both the groups (IV Edaravone therapy recipient group and IV Edaravone therapy non-recipient group). The scoring was done at the end of each cycle in the recipient group and at the same time in the non-recipient group. Edaravone was given in a dosage of 60 mg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes once daily for fourteen consecutive days for initial treatment cycle and provided a drug-free interval of 2 weeks. In the subsequent cycles, patients were administered the drug for 10 days as per the standard protocol.\nDescriptive analyses of demographics and clinical variables were performed using counts and percentages for categorical variables, and measures of central tendency (mean, median, SD, interquartile range) for continuous variables.

None reported hyperglycaemia, anaemia or myalgias.\nThis retrospective observational open label study compared the effect of IV Edaravone in definite or probable ALS patients using R-El Escorial criteria and found no significant benefit of adding IV Edaravone, nor did it improve the survival rates. Various studies have shown preserved functional status in Edaravone recipient patients using Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALS-FRS-R)]. Hiide Yoshino et al., in their 2006 phase 2 study, demonstrated a reduction in ALSFRS-R scores over a 6-month treatment period with the administration of 60 mg of Edaravone as per the standard protocol, suggesting that Edaravone may delay the progression of functional disturbances in ALS patients.\nA small retrospective, open-label study demonstrated a modest reduction of ALSFRS-R scores without any significant reported adverse events. The study also suggested a significant slowing of ALSFRS-R score decline, regardless of gender, site of onset or ethnicity. Furthermore, it highlighted the importance of initiating Edaravone treatment early, particularly in patients with a forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥60%, to observe optimal therapeutic efficacy.\nA phase 3 randomised, double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Edaravone (60 mg/day administered intravenously for 2 weeks each month) in patients with early-stages of ALS. The study demonstrated a reduction in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) scores in favour of Edaravone compared to the placebo group. In 2020, Shefner et al. reported the long-term benefits of Edaravone in ALS patients through a phase 3 open-label study involving 123 participants—65 received Edaravone for 48 weeks, while 58 initially received a placebo for 24 weeks before switching to Edaravone for the subsequent 24 weeks. The analysis suggests that Edaravone remains beneficial even when initiated after receiving a placebo for 6 months while also being able to maintain the efficacy for 1 year.\nThey used the definition efficacy-expected subpopulation (EESP), FVC ≥ 80% and a score ≥2 for all items of ALSFRS-R at baseline and post treatment. The MCI186-19 study phase 3 clinical trial in 2017 showed efficacy of Edaravone but only in selected subgroups comprising those who had an independent living status and had a preserved functional status.\nThe authors conclude that Edaravone did not improve the functional scores in definite/probable ALS patients, nor did it show survival benefits when tried as 6 cycle regimes.\nIt is a safe and tolerable drug. More research at molecular and cellular levels to identify the causative factors related to ALS and role of Edaravone needs to be re-explored apart from its ‘free radical scavenging property’. Limitations-We did not include patients with respiratory involvement, and vital capacity (FVC) was not measured in contrast to other studies who took it as at least 80%. Instead, we relied on clinical respiratory function assessment parameters such as single breath count, Breath Holding Time and chest expansion, which were measured in all patients of ALS and were compared at baseline and at end of each cycle in both intervention and non-intervention group.

For each scenario, we generated 500 datasets under each of the three trial designs investigated.\nIn this work, we considered two reference scenarios. The slow progression reference scenario (A) used the parameters previously estimated on the ARSACS population (Table\nDE was simulated at 0 and 0.5 (for the type 1 error and power assessment, respectively).

First, we investigated the influence of the duration of the trial, by using a shorter trial for the slow progression reference (2 years) and a longer trial for the fast progression reference (5 years). We also considered a lower magnitude of the residual error (\nTime Since Onset (TSO) at inclusion was assumed to follow a uniform distribution between 0 and 30 years [\nSimulated data set with a parallel (left), crossover (middle) or delayed start (right) design, with a duration of 5 years,\nEach simulated trial was analysed using all observed data with 2 models, the logistic model used for the simulation and a simpler model assuming a linear evolution of the SARA score. For the logistic model, DE was estimated with no random effect and it was fixed to 0 for the crossover and delayed start designs when patients were untreated. Also, to ensure the identifiability of all parameters,\nIn the slow progression reference scenario, we also assessed the performance of a sparser linear model, which we call sparse linear model. In this approach, we used the same linear model, but only the first, mid-trial and last observations were kept for each patient. It was made to mimic an end-of-study approach, while keeping the mid-trial point, which is needed for the crossover and delayed start designs.\nFor each scenario, we evaluated the empirical type 1 error of the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) comparing a model with and without treatment effect (type I error of 0.05), in a simulation where DE = 0. We also evaluated the power based on the LRT, corrected for the empirical type 1 error (i.e., with a statistical significance threshold chosen such that the type 1 error is 5% at that threshold), by simulating a drug effect of 50% (DE = 0.5). For each estimated proportion of significant LRT over the 500 replicates, its 95% confidence interval was constructed using an exact binomial test (using the Pearson-Clopper method).\nSimulations were performed using NONMEM 7.5.0 [\nFigure\nType 1 error for the three designs and three analysis models on the slow progression scenario without a drug effect (DE = 0%),\nCorrected power for the three designs and three analysis models on the slow progression scenario assuming a drug effect DE = 50%,\nWe then investigated the influence of a smaller magnitude of residual error (\nType 1 error for the slow progression reference and the scenarios with duration = 5 years/\nCorrected power for the slow progression reference and the scenarios with duration = 5 years/\nIn the fast progression reference scenario, the type 1 error was controlled for all designs for both the logistic and the linear models (Fig.\nType 1 error for the fast progression reference and the scenarios with duration = 5 years/\nCorrected power for the fast progression reference and the scenarios with duration = 5 years/\nVarying the magnitude of residual error (\nIn this work, we performed a simulation study to evaluate the type 1 error and power to detect a treatment effect through longitudinal modelling for different designs, progression rates, durations and magnitudes of residual error. The settings for the simulation study were derived from a model describing the evolution of SARA scores in patients with ARCA [\nIn our settings, we used a sparse linear model to mimic an end-of treatment analysis, adding the mid trial point required for the crossover and delayed start designs to keep the same number of observations for all designs. The sparse linear model was outperformed by the logistic model. For the parallel design, using longitudinal modelling with non-linear mixed effect models enabled the power of the trial to go from 50 to 88% (and from 38 to 88% with a two-sample t-test with a change from baseline). The linear mixed effect model that uses all individual observations also performed worse than the logistic model, even when informing the base and slope parameters with the time since onset at inclusion in the study, although, in most scenarios, the power of the linear model was still relatively high when using a parallel design. This shows that part of the loss of power is attributable to model misspecification since data was simulated using a logistic model.\nIn this study, we found that, in both the slow and fast progression case, the parallel design performs the best, followed by the delayed start design which had almost identical power in all scenarios. The crossover design had lower power than the other two. The poor performance of the crossover design was unexpected, as, in some settings, such as bioequivalence studies, it was shown to have better performance in terms of power than a parallel design [\nIn our settings, the delayed start design performed almost as well as the parallel design. An advantage is that all patients eventually get treated, just like in single arm trial, while preserving the ability to identify untreated progression within the trial. A delayed start design was evaluated by Wang et al. [\nIn this work, we based our simulation settings on natural disease progression in the ARSACS population of the ARCA registry assuming a disease modifying treatment effect on disease progression. Even though there are currently no disease-modifying treatments for most ARCAs, several clinical trials are ongoing for molecular therapies or gene therapies. For example, FDA just approved the use of levacetylleucine for Niemann-Pick disease type C [\nThe parameters we used in the slow progression scenario correspond to the estimates found when modelling the change in SARA score in the ARSACS patients of the ARCA registry [\nIn the simulation framework, we chose the SARA score as the primary endpoint to assess treatment efficacy. SARA score is the currently most widely used outcome to assess disease severity in ataxia patients. We chose the SARA score because it is included in most clinical trials, at least as a secondary endpoint or used in the inclusion criterion. It is a composite score comprised of 8 subitems evaluating gait, stance, sitting, speech, and 4 other items for fine motor movements. It was shown in Weyer al. [\nIn our work, the simulation framework for clinical trial designs was built upon a previously built non-linear mixed effect model [\nIn this work, we primarily focused on the simulation framework for clinical trial designs, but in the event of the analysis of a real data set, additional steps would be required to handle model misspecification. For example, other models could be tested (other forms of logistic models, exponential model, Gompertz models, IRT models) and selected according to their BIC or goodness of fits. If the performance of several models is comparable, model averaging could be implemented as in [\nIn this work, we proposed a simulation framework to compare clinical trial designs and settings in the context of rare neurological diseases, using as showcase basis for the simulations the disease group of ARCAs, characterised by small sample sizes (less than 100), patient heterogeneity (in terms of disease severity at inclusion), use of real-world data, lack of curative/efficient treatments. We studied the influence of using longitudinal models versus more standard statistical analyses, the influence of disease progression rate, trial duration and magnitude of residual error on the type 1 error and power on a clinical trial that would quantify a disease-modifying treatment effect. In our settings the parallel performed best. The delayed start design had similar performance with the advantage that all patients are treated in this design. In our framework, the crossover design had lower power, mainly due to the slow disease progression coupled with high residual error, requiring to observe disease progression for a longer time (at least in a disease-modifying treatment setting, as tested here). This work showed the complex interaction between trial settings and power. In a practical situation, different approaches could be used to predict power, such as simulations using the design of the planned study as we did in this work. Such a framework could be implemented in a simulation platform to assess the suitability of a given of trial settings for future trials. Alternatively, we could use optimal design approaches based on the Fisher Information Matrix to evaluate the power of a design, which are implemented in different softwares [\n\nSupplementary Material 1.", "content_for_embedding": "Randomized parallel designs are the gold standard used for clinical trials, and the statistical analysis is then usually a comparison of change from baseline or end of treatment measurements [\nAutosomal recessive Cerebellar Ataxias (ARCA) are a group of ultra-rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorders.

We investigated several settings, such as the design, the estimation model, the number of patients, the magnitude of residual error and the duration of the trial.\nData was simulated using a previously published NLMEM [\nThe structural model for the evolution of the SARA score, f was a four-parameter logistic model [\nA Drug Effect (DE) parameter was introduced on\nParameters of the logistic model on the ARSACS population on the ARCA registry used in the simulation study for the slow progression scenario in the control (untreated) group. For the fast progression scenario,\nThree clinical trial designs were investigated: 1, parallel design where patients are randomized to the control (untreated) group or treatment (treated) group; 2, cross-over, where patients switch group mid-trial; 3, delayed start, where patients are randomized in control or treatment group, and the patients in the control group receive the treatment at mid-trial, as shown in Fig.\nSchematic representation of the parallel, crossover and delayed start designs for a trial, with a change mid-trial in the cross-over and delayed start designs\nWe define a simulation scenario as a combination between the parameters of the model used for the simulation, the duration of the trial and the number of patients in the trial. For each scenario, we generated 500 datasets under each of the three trial designs investigated.\nIn this work, we considered two reference scenarios. The slow progression reference scenario (A) used the parameters previously estimated on the ARSACS population (Table\nDE was simulated at 0 and 0.5 (for the type 1 error and power assessment, respectively). Figure\nEvolution of Sara score versus time since onset with the logistic model using the population parameters. Each panel represents a time since onset at inclusion (5, 15 and 25 years), full or dashed lines represent two different progression rates (\nIn each of the reference scenarios, we varied other settings to study the impact on the type 1 error and power of such trials. First, we investigated the influence of the duration of the trial, by using a shorter trial for the slow progression reference (2 years) and a longer trial for the fast progression reference (5 years). We also considered a lower magnitude of the residual error (\nTime Since Onset (TSO) at inclusion was assumed to follow a uniform distribution between 0 and 30 years [\nSimulated data set with a parallel (left), crossover (middle) or delayed start (right) design, with a duration of 5 years,\nEach simulated trial was analysed using all observed data with 2 models, the logistic model used for the simulation and a simpler model assuming a linear evolution of the SARA score. For the logistic model, DE was estimated with no random effect and it was fixed to 0 for the crossover and delayed start designs when patients were untreated. Also, to ensure the identifiability of all parameters,\nIn the slow progression reference scenario, we also assessed the performance of a sparser linear model, which we call sparse linear model. In this approach, we used the same linear model, but only the first, mid-trial and last observations were kept for each patient. It was made to mimic an end-of-study approach, while keeping the mid-trial point, which is needed for the crossover and delayed start designs.\nFor each scenario, we evaluated the empirical type 1 error of the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) comparing a model with and without treatment effect (type I error of 0.05), in a simulation where DE = 0. We also evaluated the power based on the LRT, corrected for the empirical type 1 error (i.e., with a statistical significance threshold chosen such that the type 1 error is 5% at that threshold), by simulating a drug effect of 50% (DE = 0.5). For each estimated proportion of significant LRT over the 500 replicates, its 95% confidence interval was constructed using an exact binomial test (using the Pearson-Clopper method).\nSimulations were performed using NONMEM 7.5.0 [\nFigure\nType 1 error for the three designs and three analysis models on the slow progression scenario without a drug effect (DE = 0%),\nCorrected power for the three designs and three analysis models on the slow progression scenario assuming a drug effect DE = 50%,\nWe then investigated the influence of a smaller magnitude of residual error (\nType 1 error for the slow progression reference and the scenarios with duration = 5 years/\nCorrected power for the slow progression reference and the scenarios with duration = 5 years/\nIn the fast progression reference scenario, the type 1 error was controlled for all designs for both the logistic and the linear models (Fig.\nType 1 error for the fast progression reference and the scenarios with duration = 5 years/\nCorrected power for the fast progression reference and the scenarios with duration = 5 years/\nVarying the magnitude of residual error (\nIn this work, we performed a simulation study to evaluate the type 1 error and power to detect a treatment effect through longitudinal modelling for different designs, progression rates, durations and magnitudes of residual error. The settings for the simulation study were derived from a model describing the evolution of SARA scores in patients with ARCA [\nIn our settings, we used a sparse linear model to mimic an end-of treatment analysis, adding the mid trial point required for the crossover and delayed start designs to keep the same number of observations for all designs. The sparse linear model was outperformed by the logistic model. For the parallel design, using longitudinal modelling with non-linear mixed effect models enabled the power of the trial to go from 50 to 88% (and from 38 to 88% with a two-sample t-test with a change from baseline). The linear mixed effect model that uses all individual observations also performed worse than the logistic model, even when informing the base and slope parameters with the time since onset at inclusion in the study, although, in most scenarios, the power of the linear model was still relatively high when using a parallel design. This shows that part of the loss of power is attributable to model misspecification since data was simulated using a logistic model.\nIn this study, we found that, in both the slow and fast progression case, the parallel design performs the best, followed by the delayed start design which had almost identical power in all scenarios. The crossover design had lower power than the other two. The poor performance of the crossover design was unexpected, as, in some settings, such as bioequivalence studies, it was shown to have better performance in terms of power than a parallel design [\nIn our settings, the delayed start design performed almost as well as the parallel design. An advantage is that all patients eventually get treated, just like in single arm trial, while preserving the ability to identify untreated progression within the trial. A delayed start design was evaluated by Wang et al. [\nIn this work, we based our simulation settings on natural disease progression in the ARSACS population of the ARCA registry assuming a disease modifying treatment effect on disease progression. Even though there are currently no disease-modifying treatments for most ARCAs, several clinical trials are ongoing for molecular therapies or gene therapies. For example, FDA just approved the use of levacetylleucine for Niemann-Pick disease type C [\nThe parameters we used in the slow progression scenario correspond to the estimates found when modelling the change in SARA score in the ARSACS patients of the ARCA registry [\nIn the simulation framework, we chose the SARA score as the primary endpoint to assess treatment efficacy. SARA score is the currently most widely used outcome to assess disease severity in ataxia patients. We chose the SARA score because it is included in most clinical trials, at least as a secondary endpoint or used in the inclusion criterion. It is a composite score comprised of 8 subitems evaluating gait, stance, sitting, speech, and 4 other items for fine motor movements. It was shown in Weyer al. [\nIn our work, the simulation framework for clinical trial designs was built upon a previously built non-linear mixed effect model [\nIn this work, we primarily focused on the simulation framework for clinical trial designs, but in the event of the analysis of a real data set, additional steps would be required to handle model misspecification. For example, other models could be tested (other forms of logistic models, exponential model, Gompertz models, IRT models) and selected according to their BIC or goodness of fits. If the performance of several models is comparable, model averaging could be implemented as in [\nIn this work, we proposed a simulation framework to compare clinical trial designs and settings in the context of rare neurological diseases, using as showcase basis for the simulations the disease group of ARCAs, characterised by small sample sizes (less than 100), patient heterogeneity (in terms of disease severity at inclusion), use of real-world data, lack of curative/efficient treatments. We studied the influence of using longitudinal models versus more standard statistical analyses, the influence of disease progression rate, trial duration and magnitude of residual error on the type 1 error and power on a clinical trial that would quantify a disease-modifying treatment effect. In our settings the parallel performed best. The delayed start design had similar performance with the advantage that all patients are treated in this design. In our framework, the crossover design had lower power, mainly due to the slow disease progression coupled with high residual error, requiring to observe disease progression for a longer time (at least in a disease-modifying treatment setting, as tested here). This work showed the complex interaction between trial settings and power. In a practical situation, different approaches could be used to predict power, such as simulations using the design of the planned study as we did in this work. Such a framework could be implemented in a simulation platform to assess the suitability of a given of trial settings for future trials. Alternatively, we could use optimal design approaches based on the Fisher Information Matrix to evaluate the power of a design, which are implemented in different softwares [\n\nSupplementary Material 1.", "topic": "Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis"}

We also highlight the emerging technologies and interdisciplinary trends that are poised to shape the future of RLS research and clinical management. By integrating recent discoveries with foundational knowledge, this review aims to provide a broad, yet critical resource for both clinicians and researchers in the field.\nRLS is a globally prevalent disorder with notable disparities observed across regions and populations. A systematic review and modeling analysis published in 2019 estimated the global prevalence of RLS among adults aged 20–79 years at 7.12%, corresponding to approximately 356.07 million affected individuals worldwide.\nDespite these comprehensive estimates, epidemiological studies in several regions remain underrepresented. In Asia, reported prevalence varies from 1.0% to 7.2%,\nThe prevalence varies significantly across demographic and clinical populations. For instance, during pregnancy, symptom onset frequently occurs in the third trimester.\nAlthough RLS has been observed across various age groups, its incidence varies significantly. Research indicates a notable prevalence among children and adolescents. For instance, a study conducted on students aged 10 to 19 years in Turkey revealed a definitive diagnosis rate of RLS of 2.74%, with a higher prevalence in females (3.42%) than in males (2.04%).\nThe elderly population is also at a heightened risk for RLS.\nResearch indicates a notable sex disparity in the prevalence of RLS, with a higher incidence observed in females, with numerous studies demonstrating that women are approximately twice as likely to develop RLS as men.\nAlthough the body of research on racial differences is limited, existing studies have suggested variability in the prevalence and clinical manifestations of RLS across different racial groups. A study involving 359 patients with RLS in China indicated that subjective experiences reported by patients differed from those documented in Western populations, with Chinese patients describing less pain, increased soreness, and a higher prevalence of iron deficiency, along with seasonal fluctuations and absence of anemia.\nRLS exhibits significant familial aggregation, with over 50% of affected individuals reporting a family history of the condition.\nHowever, the genetic underpinnings of RLS are complex and cannot be attributed to a straightforward single-gene inheritance model. GWAS has identified several genetic loci associated with an increased risk of RLS; however, these common variants account for only a minor portion of the overall disease risk.\nNumerous genes associated with RLS have been identified through GWAS, with MEIS1, BTBD9, and PTPRD recognized as the most significantly correlated candidate genes.\nBTBD9 has garnered considerable interest in the scientific community, with research indicating that knockout of this gene in murine models produces a phenotype analogous to RLS.\nThe prevalence of RLS is attributed to the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Various genetic variants that increase an individual’s susceptibility to RLS have been identified.\nMoreover, additional environmental factors, such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and sleep disorders, may interact with genetic predispositions.\nGWAS have identified several genetic regions that increase the risk of RLS, with MEIS1, BTBD9, and PTPRD being the most consistently reported in both European and Asian populations.\nBTBD9 is another key gene identified by GWAS that has been validated in both human and animal studies.\nDespite these findings, the known genetic variants account for only a small fraction of the overall genetic contribution to RLS (less than 10%).\nThe central nervous system (CNS) is an integral part of RLS pathophysiology. Numerous studies have identified various CNS abnormalities in individuals with RLS, including alterations in nerve excitability, neurotransmitter imbalances, and modifications to both brain structure and function.\nRegarding brain structure and function, iron deficiency has been observed in the brains of individuals with RLS, correlating with decreased myelination.\nDysfunction of the dopamine system is a significant hypothesis for the pathophysiology of RLS. Numerous studies have demonstrated that dopaminergic medications can alleviate RLS symptoms, whereas dopamine receptor antagonists tend to exacerbate these symptoms, indicating critical involvement of the dopamine system in RLS.\nFurther investigations have revealed alterations in dopamine transporter (DAT) levels in patients with RLS.\nIn addition to the dopamine system, imbalances in other neurotransmitters contribute to morbidity associated with RLS. Notably, disruption of glutamatergic neurotransmission has garnered significant attention.\nMoreover, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, is gaining recognition.\nThe pathophysiology of RLS is now increasingly understood as a result of complex interactions among multiple neurotransmitter systems rather than isolated dopaminergic dysfunction, with players in this neurochemical network including the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and adenosinergic systems, whose coordinated imbalance contributes to the heterogeneous manifestations of RLS.\nIron deficiency plays a central upstream role in neurotransmitter synthesis, transport, and synaptic regulation. As a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, iron is essential for dopamine synthesis, and its deficiency reduces dopamine production and DAT activity, thereby disrupting synaptic dopamine homeostasis.\nGABAergic pathways, which are essential for motor inhibition, may fail to counterbalance this excitatory drive.\nThis integrative framework highlights iron deficiency as a converging pathogenic factor that disrupts neurochemical balance across multiple axes. This also explains why monotherapies targeting a single neurotransmitter often yield incomplete symptom control, thereby supporting the rationale for multimodal therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring iron homeostasis and neurotransmitter equilibrium.\nThe diagnostic framework for RLS has undergone multiple revisions over the past few decades, paralleling advances in clinical characterization and mechanistic understanding. Early diagnostic efforts were largely based on subjective symptom reports with significant variability in terminology and clinical interpretation. A major milestone was achieved in 1995 when the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) introduced a formal set of diagnostic criteria aimed at standardizing clinical recognition.\nSubsequent revisions in 2003 and 2012 aimed to improve diagnostic specificity and reduce misclassification, particularly in the research context. The 2012 update reaffirmed the four essential criteria and added guidance for distinguishing RLS from clinical mimics, such as positional discomfort, myalgia, or peripheral neuropathy. To enhance diagnostic confidence, a set of supportive clinical features was introduced, including a positive family history, presence of PLMs during sleep, response to dopaminergic therapy, and absence of sensory deficits on neurological examination.\nThe diagnostic criteria for RLS have also been extended to pediatric populations, where symptom descriptions are often vague or behaviorally inferred.\nImaging modalities are crucial tools for diagnosing and understanding morbidity associated with RLS. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been extensively employed in research on RLS.\nfMRI studies have revealed functional abnormalities in the brain of patients with RLS. Research indicates that these individuals exhibit pathological activation across various regions of the sensorimotor and limbic networks, implying that these areas may significantly contribute to the morbidity of RLS by influencing the manifestation of sensory and motor symptoms as well as emotional regulation.\nThe identification of effective biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring of RLS is of paramount importance. Current research has investigated the potential of various biomarkers in the diagnosis of RLS. For instance, glycomic analysis conducted on serum samples from RLS patients identified 24 N-glycan biomarker candidates that exhibited significant differences when compared to control subjects, as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\nFurthermore, the neurofilament light chain (NfL) has emerged as a biomarker with diagnostic relevance in various neurological disorders. In the context of RLS, research has indicated that while serum levels of NfL did not show significant differences between RLS patients and control groups, nor were they significantly correlated with disease duration or severity, larger-scale studies are needed to further elucidate its role in RLS.\nPharmacological interventions for RLS are primarily focused on alleviating symptoms and enhancing the overall quality of life of the affected individuals. Currently, first-line therapeutic agents predominantly consist of dopamine receptor agonists and α2δ calcium channel ligands.\nIn recent years, the therapeutic potential of α2δ calcium channel ligands such as gabapentin and pregabalin has gained prominence in the treatment of RLS. Research indicates that these agents are effective in alleviating RLS symptoms and may offer superior safety and tolerability profiles compared to dopamine agonists.\nNonpharmacological interventions play a supportive role in the management of RLS, particularly for patients with mild symptoms, those intolerant to pharmacologic agents, and individuals seeking adjunctive treatments.\nIn addition, certain behavioral therapies, such as massage and warm water baths, have shown symptom-alleviating effects.\nFurthermore, neuromodulatory physical therapy modalities, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcutaneous direct current spinal cord stimulation (tsDCS), are being explored for their utility in RLS treatment.\nDespite encouraging findings, most nonpharmacological therapies remain in the exploratory phase. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate their efficacy, establish standardized protocols, and better define their role in integrated treatment strategies for RLS.\nOwing to variability in symptoms, severity, genetic predispositions, and treatment responses among patients with RLS, it is essential to investigate personalized treatment strategies. When formulating a treatment plan, comprehensive assessment of various patient-specific factors is necessary. For instance, in individuals with iron deficiency, iron replacement therapy may serve as a critical component of treatment, and iron supplementation can rectify abnormal iron metabolism and alleviate RLS symptoms in certain patients, indicating that iron-deficient patients with RLS often experience significant symptom relief after iron supplementation.\nMoreover, treatment customization based on the genetic profiles of patients has garnered increasing attention. Advances in the genetic understanding of RLS have revealed that certain genetic variations may influence patients’ responses to pharmacological interventions. For example, individuals with specific genetic variants may exhibit varying degrees of efficacy when treated with dopamine agonists.\nTCM operates within a unique theoretical framework that differs from the Western biomedical paradigms. Central to TCM is the concept of qi, which refers to the vital energy circulating through the meridians of the body and is essential for maintaining physiological balance.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on the Shaoyao Gancao Decoction indicated that this traditional formulation may help alleviate RLS symptoms; however, the overall quality of evidence was low, highlighting the need for further rigorous validation.\nTaking Shaoyao Gancao Decoction as a case study, some reports indicate that patients experienced significant relief from leg discomfort and improved sleep quality following its administration.\nTCM is generally regarded as a safe treatment option for RLS. Studies examining various TCM prescriptions for RLS have reported relatively fewer adverse reactions.\nRecent consensus guidelines published by the IRLSSG provide a structured algorithm for the pharmacological treatment of RLS, with an emphasis on risk stratification, iron status, and augmentation prevention.\nDopamine receptor agonists, including pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine, are effective for short-term symptom control, but are associated with a well-documented risk of augmentation.\nWhen augmentation occurs, management includes dose reduction, switching to α2δ ligands, or use of long-acting opioids in refractory cases.\nIron deficiency is a key factor that can be modified. IRLSSG and subsequent clinical studies recommend initiating iron replacement therapy when serum ferritin is <75 ng/mL and <100 ng/mL if symptoms are severe or refractory, respectively. Intravenous iron formulations, such as ferric carboxymaltose or iron sucrose, are preferred over oral iron for patients with gastrointestinal intolerance or insufficient response. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant symptom reduction with IV iron administration in patients with serum ferritin levels <75 ng/mL, supporting this approach.\nTaken together, these evidence-based strategies reinforce the importance of individualized therapy based on symptom severity, iron status, and risk of augmentation. Incorporating guideline-informed decision making may improve long-term outcomes and reduce adverse treatment effects.\nEmerging technologies present novel opportunities for investigating RLS. Recent studies have indicated that electronic stimulation may serve as a promising nonpharmacological intervention for RLS. A randomized, single-blind trial involving 46 patients with RLS assessed the efficacy of electronic stimulation (ES) by dividing the participants into active and sham stimulation groups. Utilizing a handheld ES device, the lower legs were stimulated bilaterally in a 3 Hz tapping pattern. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in symptom severity within the active group accompanied by a notable interaction between time and group. These findings suggest that ES may enhance symptom relief when applied at optimal stimulation intensities, positioning it as a potential non-pharmacological treatment alternative for RLS.\nNoninvasive high-frequency peroneal nerve stimulation (NPNS) offers an innovative approach for RLS management. Research involving 20 patients with moderate-to-severe RLS revealed that NPNS effectively alleviated symptoms by activating the leg muscles without disrupting sleep. This study indicated that NPNS could sustain tonic electromyographic (EMG) activity over time, with evoked EMG responses serving as predictors of treatment efficacy. Notably, improvements in the IRLS scores were more pronounced in patients with lower motor thresholds. Additionally, NPNS treatment frequently enhances patients’ self-reported sleep onset.\nResearch on RLS has demonstrated a notable interdisciplinary trend. Given that RLS encompasses various domains including neurology, psychology, and genetics, it is challenging to fully elucidate the mechanisms of morbidity and identify effective treatment modalities within a single discipline. For instance, integration of neuroscience and psychology can enhance our understanding of how psychosocial factors influence RLS. A qualitative analysis of 15 patients with RLS revealed that stigma associated with the loss of physical control and insufficient professional recognition contributed to psychological distress, underscoring the significance of psychosocial elements in the diagnosis and treatment of RLS as well as the necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration in patient care.\nFurthermore, epidemiological-genetic crossover studies utilizing extensive population studies and genetic analyses can provide more precise insights into the genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors associated with RLS. Additionally, interdisciplinary research fosters the amalgamation of diverse technologies and methodologies, such as the integration of imaging techniques with molecular biology, facilitating a comprehensive investigation of the relationships between brain structure, function, neurotransmitter activity, and gene expression in individuals with RLS. Interdisciplinary research is anticipated to yield significant advancements in our understanding of RLS and contribute to the development of effective treatment strategies.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in the understanding of RLS, several important challenges remain in research and clinical practice. From an epidemiological perspective, RLS is known to affect a large number of people worldwide, with differences observed across age, sex, and ethnic groups.\nIn terms of genetics, studies have identified several risk genes, although these may only explain a small portion of cases. The exact mechanisms by which these genes contribute to RLS symptoms, especially how they affect brain function or iron metabolism, remain unclear. In addition, the interaction between genetic background and environmental factors, such as iron levels, diet, and lifestyle, requires further investigation.\nAt the biological level, RLS appears to involve imbalances in several brain signaling systems, including dopamine, glutamate, GABA, and adenosine. These changes are often linked to iron deficiency in the brain, which may affect the nerve activity and sleep regulation. However, it is still uncertain how these systems interact and whether one disturbance leads to another disturbance. Further research is needed to understand how changes in brain structure, function, and neurotransmitter levels contribute to the development and progression of RLS.\nCurrently, the diagnosis of RLS still depends mainly on the symptoms reported by patients. Although imaging and blood-based studies have suggested possible biomarkers, none has been widely accepted or used in clinical practice. There is a clear need to identify accurate and practical tests that can help confirm the diagnosis and distinguish RLS from other similar conditions. In addition, current treatments can be effective for many patients but are often limited by side effects or worsening symptoms over time. Although non-drug treatments and TCM may help in some cases, most studies in this area have not met rigorous scientific standards, and more high-quality research is needed to confirm their effectiveness and safety.\nDespite these challenges, new technologies offer several opportunities. For example, gene editing may help to clarify how certain genes affect RLS and could lead to gene-based treatments. Artificial intelligence could help researchers analyze large datasets to discover better diagnostic tools or identify new treatment targets. Encouraging collaboration across disciplines, including neurology, genetics, pharmacology, and traditional medicine, is important for developing more effective strategies to understand and manage RLS in the future.\nIn summary, RLS is a multifactorial neurological disorder with a substantial global burden that exhibits notable variations in prevalence across age groups, sexes, and ethnic populations. Although genetic studies have identified several susceptibility loci, such as MEIS1, BTBD9, and PTPRD, these account for only a small proportion of the heritability, indicating that the genetic architecture of RLS remains incompletely understood. At the pathophysiological level, iron deficiency is thought to play a central role in interacting with the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and adenosinergic systems to disrupt neurochemical homeostasis and contribute to symptom generation.\nAdvancements in diagnostic approaches have led to the refinement of clinical criteria and increased utilization of neuroimaging modalities. However, the lack of objective and universally accepted biomarkers continues to limit early and accurate diagnosis. Therapeutically, dopaminergic agents and α2δ calcium channel ligands remain the mainstay of pharmacological treatment, while non-pharmacological interventions, such as neuromodulation and behavioral therapies, provide additional benefits, particularly for patients with contraindications or poor tolerability to medications. Nonetheless, the long-term use of pharmacological agents is often constrained by risks such as augmentation and reduced efficacy.\nTCM, including herbal formulations and acupuncture, has shown potential in alleviating symptoms in certain patients; however, the current evidence is limited by methodological shortcomings and the absence of standardized outcome measures. To improve clinical management and deepen mechanistic insight, future research should prioritize the integration of multi-omics analyses, identification of reliable biomarkers, and execution of well-designed clinical trials to evaluate emerging and complementary therapies. Thus, advancing the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of RLS will require a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach, with future research benefiting from systematic reviews and meta-analyses to synthesize existing evidence, resolve inconsistencies, and inform evidence-based clinical practices.", "content_for_embedding": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also referred to as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common neurological sensorimotor disorder characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, typically accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, particularly during periods of rest or night.\nThe etiology of RLS is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, iron dysregulation, and disturbances in dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission.\nSeveral fundamental contributions have guided the development of RLS research.\nIn this review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the current state of RLS research encompassing epidemiological patterns, genetic findings, pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic advancements, and evolving treatment paradigms.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that dopaminergic medications can alleviate RLS symptoms, whereas dopamine receptor antagonists tend to exacerbate these symptoms, indicating critical involvement of the dopamine system in RLS.\nFurther investigations have revealed alterations in dopamine transporter (DAT) levels in patients with RLS.\nIn addition to the dopamine system, imbalances in other neurotransmitters contribute to morbidity associated with RLS. Notably, disruption of glutamatergic neurotransmission has garnered significant attention.\nMoreover, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, is gaining recognition.\nThe pathophysiology of RLS is now increasingly understood as a result of complex interactions among multiple neurotransmitter systems rather than isolated dopaminergic dysfunction, with players in this neurochemical network including the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and adenosinergic systems, whose coordinated imbalance contributes to the heterogeneous manifestations of RLS.\nIron deficiency plays a central upstream role in neurotransmitter synthesis, transport, and synaptic regulation. As a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, iron is essential for dopamine synthesis, and its deficiency reduces dopamine production and DAT activity, thereby disrupting synaptic dopamine homeostasis.\nGABAergic pathways, which are essential for motor inhibition, may fail to counterbalance this excitatory drive.\nThis integrative framework highlights iron deficiency as a converging pathogenic factor that disrupts neurochemical balance across multiple axes. This also explains why monotherapies targeting a single neurotransmitter often yield incomplete symptom control, thereby supporting the rationale for multimodal therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring iron homeostasis and neurotransmitter equilibrium.\nThe diagnostic framework for RLS has undergone multiple revisions over the past few decades, paralleling advances in clinical characterization and mechanistic understanding. Early diagnostic efforts were largely based on subjective symptom reports with significant variability in terminology and clinical interpretation. A major milestone was achieved in 1995 when the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) introduced a formal set of diagnostic criteria aimed at standardizing clinical recognition.\nSubsequent revisions in 2003 and 2012 aimed to improve diagnostic specificity and reduce misclassification, particularly in the research context. The 2012 update reaffirmed the four essential criteria and added guidance for distinguishing RLS from clinical mimics, such as positional discomfort, myalgia, or peripheral neuropathy. To enhance diagnostic confidence, a set of supportive clinical features was introduced, including a positive family history, presence of PLMs during sleep, response to dopaminergic therapy, and absence of sensory deficits on neurological examination.\nThe diagnostic criteria for RLS have also been extended to pediatric populations, where symptom descriptions are often vague or behaviorally inferred.\nImaging modalities are crucial tools for diagnosing and understanding morbidity associated with RLS. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been extensively employed in research on RLS.\nfMRI studies have revealed functional abnormalities in the brain of patients with RLS. Research indicates that these individuals exhibit pathological activation across various regions of the sensorimotor and limbic networks, implying that these areas may significantly contribute to the morbidity of RLS by influencing the manifestation of sensory and motor symptoms as well as emotional regulation.\nThe identification of effective biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring of RLS is of paramount importance. Current research has investigated the potential of various biomarkers in the diagnosis of RLS. For instance, glycomic analysis conducted on serum samples from RLS patients identified 24 N-glycan biomarker candidates that exhibited significant differences when compared to control subjects, as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\nFurthermore, the neurofilament light chain (NfL) has emerged as a biomarker with diagnostic relevance in various neurological disorders. In the context of RLS, research has indicated that while serum levels of NfL did not show significant differences between RLS patients and control groups, nor were they significantly correlated with disease duration or severity, larger-scale studies are needed to further elucidate its role in RLS.\nPharmacological interventions for RLS are primarily focused on alleviating symptoms and enhancing the overall quality of life of the affected individuals. Currently, first-line therapeutic agents predominantly consist of dopamine receptor agonists and α2δ calcium channel ligands.\nIn recent years, the therapeutic potential of α2δ calcium channel ligands such as gabapentin and pregabalin has gained prominence in the treatment of RLS. Research indicates that these agents are effective in alleviating RLS symptoms and may offer superior safety and tolerability profiles compared to dopamine agonists.\nNonpharmacological interventions play a supportive role in the management of RLS, particularly for patients with mild symptoms, those intolerant to pharmacologic agents, and individuals seeking adjunctive treatments.\nIn addition, certain behavioral therapies, such as massage and warm water baths, have shown symptom-alleviating effects.\nFurthermore, neuromodulatory physical therapy modalities, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcutaneous direct current spinal cord stimulation (tsDCS), are being explored for their utility in RLS treatment.\nDespite encouraging findings, most nonpharmacological therapies remain in the exploratory phase. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate their efficacy, establish standardized protocols, and better define their role in integrated treatment strategies for RLS.\nOwing to variability in symptoms, severity, genetic predispositions, and treatment responses among patients with RLS, it is essential to investigate personalized treatment strategies. When formulating a treatment plan, comprehensive assessment of various patient-specific factors is necessary. For instance, in individuals with iron deficiency, iron replacement therapy may serve as a critical component of treatment, and iron supplementation can rectify abnormal iron metabolism and alleviate RLS symptoms in certain patients, indicating that iron-deficient patients with RLS often experience significant symptom relief after iron supplementation.\nMoreover, treatment customization based on the genetic profiles of patients has garnered increasing attention. Advances in the genetic understanding of RLS have revealed that certain genetic variations may influence patients’ responses to pharmacological interventions. For example, individuals with specific genetic variants may exhibit varying degrees of efficacy when treated with dopamine agonists.\nTCM operates within a unique theoretical framework that differs from the Western biomedical paradigms. Central to TCM is the concept of qi, which refers to the vital energy circulating through the meridians of the body and is essential for maintaining physiological balance.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on the Shaoyao Gancao Decoction indicated that this traditional formulation may help alleviate RLS symptoms; however, the overall quality of evidence was low, highlighting the need for further rigorous validation.\nTaking Shaoyao Gancao Decoction as a case study, some reports indicate that patients experienced significant relief from leg discomfort and improved sleep quality following its administration.\nTCM is generally regarded as a safe treatment option for RLS. Studies examining various TCM prescriptions for RLS have reported relatively fewer adverse reactions.\nRecent consensus guidelines published by the IRLSSG provide a structured algorithm for the pharmacological treatment of RLS, with an emphasis on risk stratification, iron status, and augmentation prevention.\nDopamine receptor agonists, including pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine, are effective for short-term symptom control, but are associated with a well-documented risk of augmentation.\nWhen augmentation occurs, management includes dose reduction, switching to α2δ ligands, or use of long-acting opioids in refractory cases.\nIron deficiency is a key factor that can be modified. IRLSSG and subsequent clinical studies recommend initiating iron replacement therapy when serum ferritin is <75 ng/mL and <100 ng/mL if symptoms are severe or refractory, respectively. Intravenous iron formulations, such as ferric carboxymaltose or iron sucrose, are preferred over oral iron for patients with gastrointestinal intolerance or insufficient response. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant symptom reduction with IV iron administration in patients with serum ferritin levels <75 ng/mL, supporting this approach.\nTaken together, these evidence-based strategies reinforce the importance of individualized therapy based on symptom severity, iron status, and risk of augmentation. Incorporating guideline-informed decision making may improve long-term outcomes and reduce adverse treatment effects.\nEmerging technologies present novel opportunities for investigating RLS. Recent studies have indicated that electronic stimulation may serve as a promising nonpharmacological intervention for RLS. A randomized, single-blind trial involving 46 patients with RLS assessed the efficacy of electronic stimulation (ES) by dividing the participants into active and sham stimulation groups. Utilizing a handheld ES device, the lower legs were stimulated bilaterally in a 3 Hz tapping pattern. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in symptom severity within the active group accompanied by a notable interaction between time and group. These findings suggest that ES may enhance symptom relief when applied at optimal stimulation intensities, positioning it as a potential non-pharmacological treatment alternative for RLS.\nNoninvasive high-frequency peroneal nerve stimulation (NPNS) offers an innovative approach for RLS management. Research involving 20 patients with moderate-to-severe RLS revealed that NPNS effectively alleviated symptoms by activating the leg muscles without disrupting sleep. This study indicated that NPNS could sustain tonic electromyographic (EMG) activity over time, with evoked EMG responses serving as predictors of treatment efficacy. Notably, improvements in the IRLS scores were more pronounced in patients with lower motor thresholds. Additionally, NPNS treatment frequently enhances patients’ self-reported sleep onset.\nResearch on RLS has demonstrated a notable interdisciplinary trend. Given that RLS encompasses various domains including neurology, psychology, and genetics, it is challenging to fully elucidate the mechanisms of morbidity and identify effective treatment modalities within a single discipline. For instance, integration of neuroscience and psychology can enhance our understanding of how psychosocial factors influence RLS. A qualitative analysis of 15 patients with RLS revealed that stigma associated with the loss of physical control and insufficient professional recognition contributed to psychological distress, underscoring the significance of psychosocial elements in the diagnosis and treatment of RLS as well as the necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration in patient care.\nFurthermore, epidemiological-genetic crossover studies utilizing extensive population studies and genetic analyses can provide more precise insights into the genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors associated with RLS. Additionally, interdisciplinary research fosters the amalgamation of diverse technologies and methodologies, such as the integration of imaging techniques with molecular biology, facilitating a comprehensive investigation of the relationships between brain structure, function, neurotransmitter activity, and gene expression in individuals with RLS. Interdisciplinary research is anticipated to yield significant advancements in our understanding of RLS and contribute to the development of effective treatment strategies.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in the understanding of RLS, several important challenges remain in research and clinical practice. From an epidemiological perspective, RLS is known to affect a large number of people worldwide, with differences observed across age, sex, and ethnic groups.\nIn terms of genetics, studies have identified several risk genes, although these may only explain a small portion of cases. The exact mechanisms by which these genes contribute to RLS symptoms, especially how they affect brain function or iron metabolism, remain unclear. In addition, the interaction between genetic background and environmental factors, such as iron levels, diet, and lifestyle, requires further investigation.\nAt the biological level, RLS appears to involve imbalances in several brain signaling systems, including dopamine, glutamate, GABA, and adenosine. These changes are often linked to iron deficiency in the brain, which may affect the nerve activity and sleep regulation. However, it is still uncertain how these systems interact and whether one disturbance leads to another disturbance. Further research is needed to understand how changes in brain structure, function, and neurotransmitter levels contribute to the development and progression of RLS.\nCurrently, the diagnosis of RLS still depends mainly on the symptoms reported by patients. Although imaging and blood-based studies have suggested possible biomarkers, none has been widely accepted or used in clinical practice. There is a clear need to identify accurate and practical tests that can help confirm the diagnosis and distinguish RLS from other similar conditions. In addition, current treatments can be effective for many patients but are often limited by side effects or worsening symptoms over time. Although non-drug treatments and TCM may help in some cases, most studies in this area have not met rigorous scientific standards, and more high-quality research is needed to confirm their effectiveness and safety.\nDespite these challenges, new technologies offer several opportunities. For example, gene editing may help to clarify how certain genes affect RLS and could lead to gene-based treatments. Artificial intelligence could help researchers analyze large datasets to discover better diagnostic tools or identify new treatment targets. Encouraging collaboration across disciplines, including neurology, genetics, pharmacology, and traditional medicine, is important for developing more effective strategies to understand and manage RLS in the future.\nIn summary, RLS is a multifactorial neurological disorder with a substantial global burden that exhibits notable variations in prevalence across age groups, sexes, and ethnic populations. Although genetic studies have identified several susceptibility loci, such as MEIS1, BTBD9, and PTPRD, these account for only a small proportion of the heritability, indicating that the genetic architecture of RLS remains incompletely understood. At the pathophysiological level, iron deficiency is thought to play a central role in interacting with the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and adenosinergic systems to disrupt neurochemical homeostasis and contribute to symptom generation.\nAdvancements in diagnostic approaches have led to the refinement of clinical criteria and increased utilization of neuroimaging modalities. However, the lack of objective and universally accepted biomarkers continues to limit early and accurate diagnosis. Therapeutically, dopaminergic agents and α2δ calcium channel ligands remain the mainstay of pharmacological treatment, while non-pharmacological interventions, such as neuromodulation and behavioral therapies, provide additional benefits, particularly for patients with contraindications or poor tolerability to medications. Nonetheless, the long-term use of pharmacological agents is often constrained by risks such as augmentation and reduced efficacy.\nTCM, including herbal formulations and acupuncture, has shown potential in alleviating symptoms in certain patients; however, the current evidence is limited by methodological shortcomings and the absence of standardized outcome measures. To improve clinical management and deepen mechanistic insight, future research should prioritize the integration of multi-omics analyses, identification of reliable biomarkers, and execution of well-designed clinical trials to evaluate emerging and complementary therapies. Thus, advancing the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of RLS will require a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach, with future research benefiting from systematic reviews and meta-analyses to synthesize existing evidence, resolve inconsistencies, and inform evidence-based clinical practices.", "topic": "amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"}

Briefly, viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay, and cell density was adjusted to 175 cells per μl. 7000 cells were then loaded onto a single channel of a 10 × Chromium chip for each sample. The 10 × Genomics Chromium technology enables 3’ digital gene expression profiling of thousands of cells from a single sample by separately indexing each cell’s transcriptome. First, thousands of cells are partitioned into nanoliter-scale Gel Bead-In-EMulsions (GEMs). Within one GEM all generated cDNA share a common 10 × barcode. Libraries were generated and sequenced from the cDNA, and the 10 × barcodes were used to associate individual reads back to the individual partitions. To achieve single-cell resolution, the cells were delivered at a limiting dilution. Upon dissolution of the Single Cell 3’ Gel Bead in a GEM, primers containing (i) an Illumina R1 sequence (read 1 sequencing primer), (ii) a 16 nucleotide 10 × Barcode, (iii) a 10 nucleotide Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI), and (iv) a poly-dT primer sequence were released and mixed with cell lysate and Master Mix. Incubation of the GEMs then produced barcoded, full-length cDNA from polyadenylated mRNA. After incubation, the GEMs were broken and the pooled fractions were recovered. Full-length, barcoded cDNA was then amplified by PCR to generate sufficient mass for library construction. Enzymatic fragmentation and size selection were used to optimize the cDNA amplicon size prior to library construction. R1 (read 1 primer sequence) were added to the molecules during GEM incubation. P5, P7, a sample index, and R2 (read 2 primer sequence) were added during library construction via end repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation, and PCR. The final libraries contained the P5 and P7 primers used in Illumina bridge amplification. The described protocol produced Illumina-ready sequencing libraries. A Single Cell 3’ Library comprises standard Illumina paired-end constructs which begin and end with P5 and P7. The Single Cell 3′ 16 bp 10 × Barcode and 10 bp UMI are encoded in Read 1, while Read 2 is used to sequence the cDNA fragment. Sample index sequences were incorporated as the i7 index read. Read 1 and Read 2 are standard Illumina sequencing primer sites used in paired-end sequencing. Sequencing the library produced a standard Illumina BCL data output folder. The BCL data includes the paired-end Read 1 (containing the 16 bp 10 × Barcode and 10 bp UMI) and Read 2 and the sample index in the i7 index read.\nTissue specimens were processed upon receipt. The different central nervous system regions from the same donor were processed parallel. Samples from donors ALS1-ALS5 were loaded 1 region per 10 × Chromium channel. The different central nervous system region samples from donors ALS6-ALS9 were hashed, combined and loaded 1 donor per 10 × Chromium channel. Since each central nervous system region was processed from any given donor was processed parallel on the same day, each sample constitutes one batch for microglia isolation, cell capture and library construction. All sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 machine. For specifics on sequencing and QC metrics regarding the generated reads see Table\nThe majority of our downstream analysis was conducted using the R programming language (v4.0.5 for harmonization and clustering, v4.1.0 for annotation and downstream visualization) [\nCluster labels were assigned to the cells obtained from ALS donors, as follows:\nAssigning non-microglial identities.\nExpression data for all cells from all donors were first normalized using the SCTransform algorithm in Seurat, then integrated using the Harmony R package with 30 PCs and theta = 5 and each donor as a batch, and subsequently clustered using 15 Harmony dimensions using the standard Louvain algorithm in the Seurat package (version 4) with resolution = 0.5.\nT-cells, B-cells, monocytes, red blood cells, and GFAP + clusters were identified using a combination of known gene markers, as well as the composition of clusters 10–14 in the cells from non-ALS donors, as described in Olah et al., 2020 [\nIn this process, we also identified two additional clusters that were assigned cluster labels 15 and 16, since they did not correspond to any of the 14 clusters previously identified in Olah et al., 2020 [\nThe remaining cells, which were putatively assigned microglial identity, were then assigned identities using a bootstrapped random forest approach, as described below.\nAssigning microglial cluster identities.\nA training set of 200 cells randomly selected from each of the microglial clusters in Olah et al., 2020 [\nFor each cluster (1–9), differential genes distinguishing that cluster from all other cells were identified using a Mann–Whitney test on the SCTransformed cells from the training set, with nominal p-value < 0.01\nAll 9 gene sets from step 6 above were then combined (removing duplicates) to form the master gene set for random forest training.\nA random forest classifier was then constructed on the training set using the combined gene set in step 7, and subsequently run on all of the ALS donor cells, none of which were included in the training set.\nSteps 5–8 were run 20 times, with a different random seed each time.\nCells from ALS cells were then assigned to the most commonly classified cluster identity (plurality voting) over the 20 runs.\nAfter assignment of both the non-microglial and microglial cells, the entire data set was visualized using the same Harmony-based integration described in step 1 above, followed by standard UMAP implementation in Seurat (v4) with default parameters and 15 Harmony dimensions.\nThe final cluster labels thus included the 9 microglial and 5 non-microglial clusters from Olah et al., 2020 [\nStriking differences were observed in the distributions of UMI counts between 10X v2 and v3 chemistry.

For example, ALS donor 1 would be represented by ALS1-Spinal Cord, ALS1-BA9, and ALS1-BA4. From here, each donor-region is treated as one sample for the purposes of comparing proportions of specific subtypes between ALS and non-ALS samples. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compute the significance of differences in the proportion of each subset between ALS and non-ALS regions, and BH correction was used to correct\nSimilar to above, samples were aggregated at the level of donor-regions and examined for differences between different groups. In this case, the generalization of the Wilcoxon, the Kruskal–Wallis test, was used to assess the significance of differences in proportion between different regions in ALS, and the BH correction was used to account for multiple testing.\nBulk RNA-seq BAM files of the Target ALS Foundation were downloaded from the New York Genome Center (NYGC) in September 2020. These were 1063 BAM files of spinal cords and brains from 208 unique donors. BAM files were reverted to FASTQ files using the SamToFastq function of Picard tools (v2.17.4). RNA-seq reads were mapped onto the reference human genome GRCh38 using the STAR aligner (v2.5.3a) with 2-pass mapping mode. Gene expression levels were quantified using RSEM (v1.2.31) with the Ensembl human gene model (release 91). Following samples were excluded at the quality control stage: one of samples sequenced twice, samples that have > 3% ribosomal RNA, > 40% duplication rate, < 4 RNA integrity number (RIN), and a sample whose library preparation method (manual vs. automated) was missing from metadata. Donors were retained if they were diagnosed as ALS or non-neurological control. Tissues that had less than 10 samples were also excluded. After these filtering steps, 913 samples from 170 unique donors were included for subsequent analysis. The voom function of the R package limma was used to compute log\nAfter down-sampling to mitigate technical bias, gene expression was aggregated at the donor-region level (i.e. summing all counts for cells derived from a specific donor-region combination).

In brief, we used SCTransform with default parameter and harmony to integrate across batches using a thetaval of 2, and used 20 principal components for downstream analysis. To identify the optimal number of clusters for downstream analysis, we used the recently described ChooseR tool to identify an optimal clustering resolution for our dataset. Next, enrichment of different immune subtypes in ALS vs. non-ALS samples and in different regions was computed as described in sect. “\nStatistical analysis was conducted as described in the associated methods sections above. Specific\nTissue acquisition, immunohistochemistry, imaging and image analysis were performed as follows. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9, BA9), primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4, BA4), motor nucleus of the facial nerve, and spinal cord were obtained from The Johns Hopkins ALS Postmortem Tissue Core and the Target ALS Postmortem Core (through Dr. Ostrow) and through the brain donation program of Dr. Shneider. Tissue was processed according to standard protocol. Briefly, glass slide mounted FFPE sections were de-paraffinized in CitrisSolv (Cat.

Slides were cooled in distilled water for 1 min and 1 × PBS for 5 min, each at room temperature, then dried using Kimwipes. A liquid-repellent slide marker pen (A-PAP Pen) was used to draw boundaries around each tissue section. The tissue was rehydrated using PBS and was washed 3 times at 5-min intervals in a humidified chamber. Unspecific antibody blocker solution consisting of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)(Cat.

Primary antibody solution was prepared in a 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube by adding the primary antibodies to the BSA-containing buffer. Added 200 μL of primary antibody solution and incubated slides in the humidified chamber in a 4 °C cold room overnight.

Accordingly, mechanistic studies addressing their role in ALS models are challenging at this moment.

For a detailed description of the brain regions sampled, clinical diagnosis, age and sex of the donors see Table\nThe isolation of microglia was performed according to our published protocol [\nCell capture, amplification and library construction on the 10 × Genomics Chromium platform were performed according to the manufacturer’s publicly available protocol. Briefly, viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay, and cell density was adjusted to 175 cells per μl. 7000 cells were then loaded onto a single channel of a 10 × Chromium chip for each sample. The 10 × Genomics Chromium technology enables 3’ digital gene expression profiling of thousands of cells from a single sample by separately indexing each cell’s transcriptome. First, thousands of cells are partitioned into nanoliter-scale Gel Bead-In-EMulsions (GEMs). Within one GEM all generated cDNA share a common 10 × barcode. Libraries were generated and sequenced from the cDNA, and the 10 × barcodes were used to associate individual reads back to the individual partitions. To achieve single-cell resolution, the cells were delivered at a limiting dilution. Upon dissolution of the Single Cell 3’ Gel Bead in a GEM, primers containing (i) an Illumina R1 sequence (read 1 sequencing primer), (ii) a 16 nucleotide 10 × Barcode, (iii) a 10 nucleotide Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI), and (iv) a poly-dT primer sequence were released and mixed with cell lysate and Master Mix. Incubation of the GEMs then produced barcoded, full-length cDNA from polyadenylated mRNA. After incubation, the GEMs were broken and the pooled fractions were recovered. Full-length, barcoded cDNA was then amplified by PCR to generate sufficient mass for library construction. Enzymatic fragmentation and size selection were used to optimize the cDNA amplicon size prior to library construction. R1 (read 1 primer sequence) were added to the molecules during GEM incubation. P5, P7, a sample index, and R2 (read 2 primer sequence) were added during library construction via end repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation, and PCR. The final libraries contained the P5 and P7 primers used in Illumina bridge amplification. The described protocol produced Illumina-ready sequencing libraries. A Single Cell 3’ Library comprises standard Illumina paired-end constructs which begin and end with P5 and P7. The Single Cell 3′ 16 bp 10 × Barcode and 10 bp UMI are encoded in Read 1, while Read 2 is used to sequence the cDNA fragment. Sample index sequences were incorporated as the i7 index read. Read 1 and Read 2 are standard Illumina sequencing primer sites used in paired-end sequencing. Sequencing the library produced a standard Illumina BCL data output folder. The BCL data includes the paired-end Read 1 (containing the 16 bp 10 × Barcode and 10 bp UMI) and Read 2 and the sample index in the i7 index read.\nTissue specimens were processed upon receipt. The different central nervous system regions from the same donor were processed parallel. Samples from donors ALS1-ALS5 were loaded 1 region per 10 × Chromium channel.

Respiratory dysfunction is one of the most important complications of ALS, which reduces quality of life and increases mortality. Respiratory muscle strengthening exercises play a significant role in improving the respiratory status of patients with various chronic respiratory diseases\nThe present clinical trial study demonstrates the role of an inspiratory muscle training (IMT) device intervention in patients with ALS. Overall evidence from this study showed that IMT can improve respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function in patients with ALS\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease involving the upper and lower motor neurons, which annually results in the death of 30,000 patients worldwide (\nVarious studies have shown that about 3% to 5% of these patients suffer from respiratory failure, which can lead to reduced quality of life and increased mortality rates in these patients at advanced levels (\nPrevious studies have shown that the vital capacity of ALS in 26 patients studied showed lower values than expected. In patients exhibiting symptoms of the disease, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO\nIn patients with ALS, spontaneous breathing is affected by damage to the anterior horn neurons that are responsible for the diaphragm nerve. The diaphragm can be reinforced like other skeletal muscles in the body, which can improve lung parameters and, ultimately, respiratory status in ALS patients (\nThe inspiratory muscle training (IMT) device, by applying controlled current resistance, strengthens the respiratory muscles and prevents the progression of respiratory failure (\nDespite the widespread use of the IMT system in recent years, its use in ALS patients has been less studied. The present study was performed to investigate the role of this method on respiratory muscle function in these patients.\nThe present study was performed as a non-blind, randomized clinical trial in parallel groups from April to September 2019 in Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Tehran, Iran. There was no communication between patients participating in each group when visiting the relevant clinic. Since ALS is a rare disease and our access to patients was very limited, sampling was conducted using total population sampling. In this study, a total of 30 patients diagnosed with ALS were referred by a neurologist. Following the acquisition of informed consent and the application of inclusion criteria—which required the ability to perform exercises, a maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) of ˂60 cm H\nPatients performed controlled exercise therapy (including diaphragm exercises and chest opening exercises) in the control group, and in the intervention group, patients used the IMT in addition to exercise-controlled therapy (similar to the control group). Both groups performed these exercises twice a day for 8 weeks.\nInspiratory muscle training was performed using a mechanical IMT device (POWER breath, United Kingdom), and the patients in the intervention group performed deep, powerful inhalations to reach the desired threshold. This threshold is set at 30 % PImax initially. In the morning and afternoon, the patients followed the prescribed regimen of 30 repetitions of these exercises, taking a 2-minute break after each ten repetitions. Within two weeks, the severity of IMT increased gradually to 60% PImax.\nPatients in both groups were tested for the first time at the beginning of the training programs and then 8 weeks after exercise. Factors affecting lung function were evaluated by pulmonologists, and an experienced physical therapist evaluated patients' ability to perform a 6-minute walk test.\nTo measure spirometry variables, the patient is in a calm position and places her lips firmly around the mouth of the spirometry device. The patient then inhaled and exhaled forcefully, telling the patient to breathe as much as possible and then rest for a minute. This procedure was repeated 3 times, and the best performance was considered for each patient. The patient was referred to the pulmonary function test (PFT) unit to measure PImax and PEmax. In addition, a computer-based IMT device (Power breath K5) was used to measure the strength of breathing muscles index (S-index).For this purpose, the patient learns to perform deep breathing after complete or relatively complete exhaustion. It then drains the lungs as far as possible while the patient's nostrils are closed and performs a sudden inhalation while holding the device with both hands. This procedure is repeated at least 3 times, and the patient rests 30 seconds between each repetition. The best performance is considered for each patient. The procedure was performed once on the first day and once at the end of the eighth week.\nThe 6-minute walk test reveals the patient's exercise capacity and can provide patients with greater safety and comfort than methods such as the shuttle test (\nArterial blood gas analysis was used to assess the condition of ventilation and acid-base disorders in patients. Blood samples obtained from patients were transferred to the laboratory and interpreted.\nA post hoc power analysis was performed for the primary outcome using a paired-sample t-test. The calculated power for detecting the specified effect size was 0.95. This indicates that the study had a very high probability of detecting the effect size, assuming the true effect size and significance level provided are accurate. Because ALS is a rare disease and the number of patients referred by the neurology clinic is very low, we examined all patients referred by a neurologist to Masih Daneshvari Hospital who met the inclusion criteria.

Overall evidence from this study showed that IMT can improve respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function in patients with ALS\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease involving the upper and lower motor neurons, which annually results in the death of 30,000 patients worldwide (\nVarious studies have shown that about 3% to 5% of these patients suffer from respiratory failure, which can lead to reduced quality of life and increased mortality rates in these patients at advanced levels (\nPrevious studies have shown that the vital capacity of ALS in 26 patients studied showed lower values than expected.

The diaphragm can be reinforced like other skeletal muscles in the body, which can improve lung parameters and, ultimately, respiratory status in ALS patients (\nThe inspiratory muscle training (IMT) device, by applying controlled current resistance, strengthens the respiratory muscles and prevents the progression of respiratory failure (\nDespite the widespread use of the IMT system in recent years, its use in ALS patients has been less studied. The present study was performed to investigate the role of this method on respiratory muscle function in these patients.\nThe present study was performed as a non-blind, randomized clinical trial in parallel groups from April to September 2019 in Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Tehran, Iran. There was no communication between patients participating in each group when visiting the relevant clinic. Since ALS is a rare disease and our access to patients was very limited, sampling was conducted using total population sampling. In this study, a total of 30 patients diagnosed with ALS were referred by a neurologist. Following the acquisition of informed consent and the application of inclusion criteria—which required the ability to perform exercises, a maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) of ˂60 cm H\nPatients performed controlled exercise therapy (including diaphragm exercises and chest opening exercises) in the control group, and in the intervention group, patients used the IMT in addition to exercise-controlled therapy (similar to the control group). Both groups performed these exercises twice a day for 8 weeks.\nInspiratory muscle training was performed using a mechanical IMT device (POWER breath, United Kingdom), and the patients in the intervention group performed deep, powerful inhalations to reach the desired threshold. This threshold is set at 30 % PImax initially. In the morning and afternoon, the patients followed the prescribed regimen of 30 repetitions of these exercises, taking a 2-minute break after each ten repetitions. Within two weeks, the severity of IMT increased gradually to 60% PImax.\nPatients in both groups were tested for the first time at the beginning of the training programs and then 8 weeks after exercise. Factors affecting lung function were evaluated by pulmonologists, and an experienced physical therapist evaluated patients' ability to perform a 6-minute walk test.\nTo measure spirometry variables, the patient is in a calm position and places her lips firmly around the mouth of the spirometry device. The patient then inhaled and exhaled forcefully, telling the patient to breathe as much as possible and then rest for a minute. This procedure was repeated 3 times, and the best performance was considered for each patient. The patient was referred to the pulmonary function test (PFT) unit to measure PImax and PEmax. In addition, a computer-based IMT device (Power breath K5) was used to measure the strength of breathing muscles index (S-index).For this purpose, the patient learns to perform deep breathing after complete or relatively complete exhaustion. It then drains the lungs as far as possible while the patient's nostrils are closed and performs a sudden inhalation while holding the device with both hands. This procedure is repeated at least 3 times, and the patient rests 30 seconds between each repetition. The best performance is considered for each patient. The procedure was performed once on the first day and once at the end of the eighth week.\nThe 6-minute walk test reveals the patient's exercise capacity and can provide patients with greater safety and comfort than methods such as the shuttle test (\nArterial blood gas analysis was used to assess the condition of ventilation and acid-base disorders in patients. Blood samples obtained from patients were transferred to the laboratory and interpreted.\nA post hoc power analysis was performed for the primary outcome using a paired-sample t-test. The calculated power for detecting the specified effect size was 0.95. This indicates that the study had a very high probability of detecting the effect size, assuming the true effect size and significance level provided are accurate.

These mutations lead to elevated levels of 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol, oxysterols known to be neurotoxic and blood-brain-barrier permeable. Their accumulation contributes significantly to SPG5 pathogenesis, resulting in spastic gait disturbance and severely impaired quality of life. Using a Cyp7b1\nAAV8-mediated gene therapy targeting the liver effectively normalized peripheral oxysterol levels in a mouse model of hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5 (SPG5). However, brain oxysterol levels remained partially corrected, indicating that successful SPG5 treatment requires a gene therapy approach that also targets the central nervous system.", "full_text": "The term hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) refers to a large group of inherited motor neuron disorders sharing the clinical hallmark of progressive spastic gait disturbance leading to increasing immobility and disability. HSP is primarily characterized by degeneration of the corticospinal tracts in the spinal cord and affects axons of upper motor neurons in a length-dependent manner.\nSPG5 is an autosomal recessive form of HSP with onset in most cases during adolescence (median age of onset: 13 years, range 1–63).\nThe mechanism by which elevated oxysterol levels rather selectively affect the corticospinal tract and posterior column in SPG5 is not fully elucidated. High levels of oxysterols in the brain may lead to increased incorporation of these abnormal cholesterol metabolites into lipid membranes. Since the axons of the corticospinal tract to the legs and the dorsal column fibers from the leg are the longest axons in the human body, the effect of an altered lipid composition of membranes may accumulate in these tracts and may explain their predominant affection.\nThis led to the hypothesis that lowering 25-HC and 27-HC in the CNS of SPG5 patients may help to slow down or even halt disease progression in SPG5. In a pilot study, we aimed to reduce the levels of 25-HC and 27-HC in SPG5 patients by lowering cholesterol using statins. In a randomized controlled trial, atorvastatin (40 mg/day) reduced blood 25-HC levels by about 20% and 27-HC levels by about 30% after 9 weeks.

No acute toxicity was observed after injection in any of the experimental groups. The animals behaved normally and the injection sites showed no signs of infection or immune response.\nAdditionally, aminotransferase (aspartate transaminase [AST]/alanine transaminase [ALT]) serum levels were not elevated with any virus dose at the study endpoint. Mean AST values for WT, knockout (KO), and vehicle-treated groups were 62.2 ± 42.4, 87.5 ± 34.9, and 70.8 ± 30.0 U/L, respectively, while in the three treated groups it was 79.3 ± 17.0, 81.8 ± 17.9, and 73.0 ± 23.9 U/L for 1E10, 5E10, and 1E11 vg/animal.

IHC showed widespread expression of CYP7B1 exceeding the WT levels already in the lowest vector dose with increasing expression in the intermediate and high doses. These results were confirmed by qPCR where the human CYP7B1 mRNA could not be detected in control groups, but were expressed similar to the housekeeping gene Actb in the lowest dosage (ΔCt 0.10 ± 0.97).

Similarly, 27-HC was reduced to near normal levels in the medium and high dose groups (52.7 ± 13.1 ng/mg CHOL in highest dose group compared to 186.0 ± 13.1 ng/mg CHOL in the vehicle group and 50.0 ± 10.1 ng/mg CHOL in WT controls). Again, 24-HC remained unchanged (\nIn summary, the differences between vehicle and treatment groups were highly significant at all virus doses for both oxysterol biomarkers (25-HC and 27-HC) with no effect on the cerebral metabolite 24-HC.

Indeed, sterol 27-hydroxylase, the major enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of cholesterol at position C27, is substantially expressed in the brain where it is involved in the breakdown of the cerebral oxysterol 24-HC.\nThis finding is particularly important when considering liver transplantation as a potential treatment option for CYP7B1 deficiency. In some young patients, CYP7B1 mutations cause severe neonatal liver failure.\nThe notion that CYP7B1 expression in the CNS is required for a healthy state of the brain and spinal cord is supported by the fact that CYP7B1 physiologically shows substantial expression in oligodendrocytes.\nBlood levels of the cerebral cholesterol metabolite 24-HC remained unaffected throughout the study, whereas a slight reduction of 24-HC was observed in the liver at the highest doses of AAV8-TTR-hCYP7B1.

HSP is primarily characterized by degeneration of the corticospinal tracts in the spinal cord and affects axons of upper motor neurons in a length-dependent manner.\nSPG5 is an autosomal recessive form of HSP with onset in most cases during adolescence (median age of onset: 13 years, range 1–63).\nThe mechanism by which elevated oxysterol levels rather selectively affect the corticospinal tract and posterior column in SPG5 is not fully elucidated. High levels of oxysterols in the brain may lead to increased incorporation of these abnormal cholesterol metabolites into lipid membranes. Since the axons of the corticospinal tract to the legs and the dorsal column fibers from the leg are the longest axons in the human body, the effect of an altered lipid composition of membranes may accumulate in these tracts and may explain their predominant affection.\nThis led to the hypothesis that lowering 25-HC and 27-HC in the CNS of SPG5 patients may help to slow down or even halt disease progression in SPG5. In a pilot study, we aimed to reduce the levels of 25-HC and 27-HC in SPG5 patients by lowering cholesterol using statins. In a randomized controlled trial, atorvastatin (40 mg/day) reduced blood 25-HC levels by about 20% and 27-HC levels by about 30% after 9 weeks. However, the translation of this treatment effect into the CSF was limited.\nTo this end, we established an mRNA-based enzyme replacement therapy.

(B) Baseline serum levels of oxysterols in WT and KO animals before the study. The biomarkers 25- and 27 HC are significantly elevated in KO animals recapitulating the metabolic phenotype of SPG5 whereas the cerebral metabolite 24-HC remains unchanged (C) Serum AST/ALT levels of animals at the endpoint (D49). No elevation of liver aminotransferases above untreated conditions was observed. Gray background represents range of PBS-treated KO animals.\nOverall, the injection was well tolerated. No acute toxicity was observed after injection in any of the experimental groups. The animals behaved normally and the injection sites showed no signs of infection or immune response.\nAdditionally, aminotransferase (aspartate transaminase [AST]/alanine transaminase [ALT]) serum levels were not elevated with any virus dose at the study endpoint. Mean AST values for WT, knockout (KO), and vehicle-treated groups were 62.2 ± 42.4, 87.5 ± 34.9, and 70.8 ± 30.0 U/L, respectively, while in the three treated groups it was 79.3 ± 17.0, 81.8 ± 17.9, and 73.0 ± 23.9 U/L for 1E10, 5E10, and 1E11 vg/animal. For ALT mean control levels were 26.4 ± 3.4, 33.7 ± 15.7, and 27.3 ± 4.9 U/L (WT, KO, and vehicle) and in treated groups 37.0 ± 12.6, 33.2 ± 5.9, and 31 ± 6.2 U/L (1E10, 5E10, and 1E11 vg/animal) (\nMice were sacrificed for further analyses of potential toxic and therapeutic effects six weeks after vector application. Blood and organs were collected from each animal for further analyses.\nThe transduction efficiency of AAV-TTR-hCYP7B1 in the liver was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), qPCR, and western blot. IHC showed widespread expression of CYP7B1 exceeding the WT levels already in the lowest vector dose with increasing expression in the intermediate and high doses. These results were confirmed by qPCR where the human CYP7B1 mRNA could not be detected in control groups, but were expressed similar to the housekeeping gene Actb in the lowest dosage (ΔCt 0.10 ± 0.97). In the highest dose group of AAV-TTR-hCYP7B1 administered animals, the human CYP7B1 expression exceeded Actb by almost 3.5-fold (ΔCt 3.45 ± 0.29). On protein level, the endogenous expression of murine Cyp7b1 could be detected in WT but not in PBS or vehicle injected\nLiver transduction efficacy and liver oxysterol levels\n(A) Immunohistochemistry of liver sections against CYP7B1 from wild-type (WT) animals, Cyp7B1\nTreatment effects in the liver transferred well into blood.

(B) Serum oxysterol levels of each animal at the endpoint (D49) showed normalization to WT levels for both oxysterols in all vector dosages and except the lowest dose where 27-HC was only reduced by approximately 50% relative to vehicle. Pairwise comparison to AAV8-TTR-GFP vehicle group. ns, not significant; ∗\nThe marked reduction in serum 25-HC and 27-HC observed two days post-injection persisted until the endpoint of this study six weeks after injection. 25-HC was substantially reduced to WT levels in the medium and high dose group (1.8 ± 4.5 ng/mg CHOL in the highest dose group compared to 213.2 ± 78.5 ng/mg CHOL in the vehicle group and 0.6 ± 1.5 ng/mg CHOL in the WT controls). Similarly, 27-HC was reduced to near normal levels in the medium and high dose groups (52.7 ± 13.1 ng/mg CHOL in highest dose group compared to 186.0 ± 13.1 ng/mg CHOL in the vehicle group and 50.0 ± 10.1 ng/mg CHOL in WT controls). Again, 24-HC remained unchanged (\nIn summary, the differences between vehicle and treatment groups were highly significant at all virus doses for both oxysterol biomarkers (25-HC and 27-HC) with no effect on the cerebral metabolite 24-HC. Compared to WT levels, only the lowest dose of AAV8-TTR-hCYP7B1 did not normalize the serum levels entirely, indicating the lower limit of the therapeutic dose for an effective treatment (\nIn the brain, the effects of AAV8-TTR-hCYP7B1 treatment on oxysterol levels were clearly different from those in the blood and liver. The rapid and pronounced decrease of oxysterols in liver and blood only partially translated to the brain (\nOxysterol levels in the brain at endpoint\n(A) Oxysterol biomarker concentrations in brain homogenate. While a significant reduction of 25-HC was achieved in all treatment dosages, the levels did not come close to WT levels. No effect on brain 27-HC levels could be detected.

Triangular points represent data from male, circles from female animals. ns, not significant; ∗\nThis study demonstrates an efficient, long-lasting correction of key metabolic abnormalities in the liver and blood of Cyp7b1\nUnder physiological conditions, it has been shown that the majority of 25-HC and 27-HC enters the brain from the periphery.\nLiver transduction with an AAV8-TTR-hCYP7B1 vector resulted in the expression of functional\nAlthough the AAV8-TTR-hCYP7B1 vector reduced blood 25-HC and 27-HC levels to near WT levels, somewhat unexpected, this normalization in the periphery had only a limited effect on brain oxysterol levels, despite previous findings that most of 25-HC and 27-HC in the CNS originate from the periphery.\nAn alternative explanation for the limited translation of the peripheral normalization of oxysterol levels to the brain could be an autochthonous synthesis of oxysterols in the CNS. Indeed, sterol 27-hydroxylase, the major enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of cholesterol at position C27, is substantially expressed in the brain where it is involved in the breakdown of the cerebral oxysterol 24-HC.\nThis finding is particularly important when considering liver transplantation as a potential treatment option for CYP7B1 deficiency. In some young patients, CYP7B1 mutations cause severe neonatal liver failure.\nThe notion that CYP7B1 expression in the CNS is required for a healthy state of the brain and spinal cord is supported by the fact that CYP7B1 physiologically shows substantial expression in oligodendrocytes.\nBlood levels of the cerebral cholesterol metabolite 24-HC remained unaffected throughout the study, whereas a slight reduction of 24-HC was observed in the liver at the highest doses of AAV8-TTR-hCYP7B1. This may imply that\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrated that intravenous treatment with AAV8-TTR-hCYP7B1 leads to a rapid and durable normalization of the metabolic abnormalities in the blood and liver of an SPG5 mouse model.

For a detailed description of the brain regions sampled, clinical diagnosis, age and sex of the donors see Table\nThe isolation of microglia was performed according to our published protocol [\nCell capture, amplification and library construction on the 10 × Genomics Chromium platform were performed according to the manufacturer’s publicly available protocol. Briefly, viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay, and cell density was adjusted to 175 cells per μl. 7000 cells were then loaded onto a single channel of a 10 × Chromium chip for each sample. The 10 × Genomics Chromium technology enables 3’ digital gene expression profiling of thousands of cells from a single sample by separately indexing each cell’s transcriptome. First, thousands of cells are partitioned into nanoliter-scale Gel Bead-In-EMulsions (GEMs). Within one GEM all generated cDNA share a common 10 × barcode. Libraries were generated and sequenced from the cDNA, and the 10 × barcodes were used to associate individual reads back to the individual partitions. To achieve single-cell resolution, the cells were delivered at a limiting dilution. Upon dissolution of the Single Cell 3’ Gel Bead in a GEM, primers containing (i) an Illumina R1 sequence (read 1 sequencing primer), (ii) a 16 nucleotide 10 × Barcode, (iii) a 10 nucleotide Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI), and (iv) a poly-dT primer sequence were released and mixed with cell lysate and Master Mix. Incubation of the GEMs then produced barcoded, full-length cDNA from polyadenylated mRNA. After incubation, the GEMs were broken and the pooled fractions were recovered. Full-length, barcoded cDNA was then amplified by PCR to generate sufficient mass for library construction. Enzymatic fragmentation and size selection were used to optimize the cDNA amplicon size prior to library construction. R1 (read 1 primer sequence) were added to the molecules during GEM incubation. P5, P7, a sample index, and R2 (read 2 primer sequence) were added during library construction via end repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation, and PCR. The final libraries contained the P5 and P7 primers used in Illumina bridge amplification. The described protocol produced Illumina-ready sequencing libraries. A Single Cell 3’ Library comprises standard Illumina paired-end constructs which begin and end with P5 and P7. The Single Cell 3′ 16 bp 10 × Barcode and 10 bp UMI are encoded in Read 1, while Read 2 is used to sequence the cDNA fragment. Sample index sequences were incorporated as the i7 index read. Read 1 and Read 2 are standard Illumina sequencing primer sites used in paired-end sequencing. Sequencing the library produced a standard Illumina BCL data output folder. The BCL data includes the paired-end Read 1 (containing the 16 bp 10 × Barcode and 10 bp UMI) and Read 2 and the sample index in the i7 index read.\nTissue specimens were processed upon receipt. The different central nervous system regions from the same donor were processed parallel. Samples from donors ALS1-ALS5 were loaded 1 region per 10 × Chromium channel. The different central nervous system region samples from donors ALS6-ALS9 were hashed, combined and loaded 1 donor per 10 × Chromium channel. Since each central nervous system region was processed from any given donor was processed parallel on the same day, each sample constitutes one batch for microglia isolation, cell capture and library construction. All sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 machine. For specifics on sequencing and QC metrics regarding the generated reads see Table\nThe majority of our downstream analysis was conducted using the R programming language (v4.0.5 for harmonization and clustering, v4.1.0 for annotation and downstream visualization) [\nCluster labels were assigned to the cells obtained from ALS donors, as follows:\nAssigning non-microglial identities.\nExpression data for all cells from all donors were first normalized using the SCTransform algorithm in Seurat, then integrated using the Harmony R package with 30 PCs and theta = 5 and each donor as a batch, and subsequently clustered using 15 Harmony dimensions using the standard Louvain algorithm in the Seurat package (version 4) with resolution = 0.5.\nT-cells, B-cells, monocytes, red blood cells, and GFAP + clusters were identified using a combination of known gene markers, as well as the composition of clusters 10–14 in the cells from non-ALS donors, as described in Olah et al., 2020 [\nIn this process, we also identified two additional clusters that were assigned cluster labels 15 and 16, since they did not correspond to any of the 14 clusters previously identified in Olah et al., 2020 [\nThe remaining cells, which were putatively assigned microglial identity, were then assigned identities using a bootstrapped random forest approach, as described below.\nAssigning microglial cluster identities.\nA training set of 200 cells randomly selected from each of the microglial clusters in Olah et al., 2020 [\nFor each cluster (1–9), differential genes distinguishing that cluster from all other cells were identified using a Mann–Whitney test on the SCTransformed cells from the training set, with nominal p-value < 0.01\nAll 9 gene sets from step 6 above were then combined (removing duplicates) to form the master gene set for random forest training.\nA random forest classifier was then constructed on the training set using the combined gene set in step 7, and subsequently run on all of the ALS donor cells, none of which were included in the training set.\nSteps 5–8 were run 20 times, with a different random seed each time.\nCells from ALS cells were then assigned to the most commonly classified cluster identity (plurality voting) over the 20 runs.\nAfter assignment of both the non-microglial and microglial cells, the entire data set was visualized using the same Harmony-based integration described in step 1 above, followed by standard UMAP implementation in Seurat (v4) with default parameters and 15 Harmony dimensions.\nThe final cluster labels thus included the 9 microglial and 5 non-microglial clusters from Olah et al., 2020 [\nStriking differences were observed in the distributions of UMI counts between 10X v2 and v3 chemistry. As this was driving differential clustering, count matrices from v3 samples were down-sampled by 50% using the DropletUtils [\nTo identify cluster-defining gene sets, the\nTo identify cluster-defining gene sets, each cluster was separated into ALS and non-ALS microglial cells, then the\nTo construct a phylogenetic tree evaluating the similarity of different microglial subtypes, the\nTo perform functional annotation of microglial clusters, the top 50 up- or down-regulated genes in the differentially expressed gene lists for each cluster were taken for analysis.

For example, ALS donor 1 would be represented by ALS1-Spinal Cord, ALS1-BA9, and ALS1-BA4. From here, each donor-region is treated as one sample for the purposes of comparing proportions of specific subtypes between ALS and non-ALS samples. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compute the significance of differences in the proportion of each subset between ALS and non-ALS regions, and BH correction was used to correct\nSimilar to above, samples were aggregated at the level of donor-regions and examined for differences between different groups. In this case, the generalization of the Wilcoxon, the Kruskal–Wallis test, was used to assess the significance of differences in proportion between different regions in ALS, and the BH correction was used to account for multiple testing.\nBulk RNA-seq BAM files of the Target ALS Foundation were downloaded from the New York Genome Center (NYGC) in September 2020. These were 1063 BAM files of spinal cords and brains from 208 unique donors. BAM files were reverted to FASTQ files using the SamToFastq function of Picard tools (v2.17.4). RNA-seq reads were mapped onto the reference human genome GRCh38 using the STAR aligner (v2.5.3a) with 2-pass mapping mode. Gene expression levels were quantified using RSEM (v1.2.31) with the Ensembl human gene model (release 91). Following samples were excluded at the quality control stage: one of samples sequenced twice, samples that have > 3% ribosomal RNA, > 40% duplication rate, < 4 RNA integrity number (RIN), and a sample whose library preparation method (manual vs. automated) was missing from metadata. Donors were retained if they were diagnosed as ALS or non-neurological control. Tissues that had less than 10 samples were also excluded. After these filtering steps, 913 samples from 170 unique donors were included for subsequent analysis. The voom function of the R package limma was used to compute log\nAfter down-sampling to mitigate technical bias, gene expression was aggregated at the donor-region level (i.e. summing all counts for cells derived from a specific donor-region combination). Principal components analysis was computed on this pseudo-bulk expression data, and the first two components were plotted.\nInitial analysis of the spatial transcriptomic data from Maniatis et al. 2019 [\nwhere\nTo identify regulators, we leveraged the recently published CHEA3 [\nNon-microglial immune subtypes (clusters 10, 11, and 12) were separated from other data and re-run through a clustering/dimensionality reduction pipeline. In brief, we used SCTransform with default parameter and harmony to integrate across batches using a thetaval of 2, and used 20 principal components for downstream analysis. To identify the optimal number of clusters for downstream analysis, we used the recently described ChooseR tool to identify an optimal clustering resolution for our dataset. Next, enrichment of different immune subtypes in ALS vs. non-ALS samples and in different regions was computed as described in sect. “\nStatistical analysis was conducted as described in the associated methods sections above. Specific\nTissue acquisition, immunohistochemistry, imaging and image analysis were performed as follows. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9, BA9), primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4, BA4), motor nucleus of the facial nerve, and spinal cord were obtained from The Johns Hopkins ALS Postmortem Tissue Core and the Target ALS Postmortem Core (through Dr. Ostrow) and through the brain donation program of Dr. Shneider. Tissue was processed according to standard protocol. Briefly, glass slide mounted FFPE sections were de-paraffinized in CitrisSolv (Cat. No.: 1601H) for 20 min, subjected to decreasing ethanol series (ethanol 100%, ethanol 100%, ethanol 70%) for 1 min each, rehydrated in distilled water for 1 min, which was followed by 1 × phosphate buffered saline wash (PBS) (Cat. No.: 21–040-CM) for 5 min. Slides were then submerged in antigen retrieval low pH (10X) (Cat. No.: 00-4955-58) solution and heated using a water bath for 25 min. Slides were cooled in distilled water for 1 min and 1 × PBS for 5 min, each at room temperature, then dried using Kimwipes. A liquid-repellent slide marker pen (A-PAP Pen) was used to draw boundaries around each tissue section. The tissue was rehydrated using PBS and was washed 3 times at 5-min intervals in a humidified chamber. Unspecific antibody blocker solution consisting of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)(Cat. No.: B4287-25G) and 0.1% Triton X (Cat. No.: T8787-50ML) in PBS was added to each slide and incubated in a humidified chamber for 1 h. Primary antibody solution was prepared in a 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube by adding the primary antibodies to the BSA-containing buffer. Added 200 μL of primary antibody solution and incubated slides in the humidified chamber in a 4 °C cold room overnight. The next morning, the tissue sections were washed 3 times at 5-min intervals with 1 × PBS. Secondary antibody solutions consisted of Alexa Fluor Plus fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies in their respective dilutions in the BSA Buffer. 200 μL of secondary antibody solution was added to each slide, which were then incubated in the humidified chamber for 1 h. Then the tissue sections were washed 3 times at 5-min intervals with 1 × PBS. Next, we added 200 μL of 70% ethanol and Sudan Black (Cat.

Our study by design incorporates a variety of ALS donors in terms of age, sex, TDP43 and genetic status. We designed our experimental set up as such with the aim to capture a common theme in terms of microglia population structure in ALS—one that transcends other factors that can affect the relative abundance of microglia subsets in this disease. This approach carried the risk of not finding such an overarching pattern of ALS-specific microglia population structure in the set of donors included in this study. Importantly, this was not the case, as all donors showed very similar patterns of microglia subset relative abundances (Figure\nOne characteristic of studies requiring fresh human CNS specimens is the lack of control samples as they are, understandably, very difficult to procure. To circumvent this drawback, we utilized a variety of approaches to best describe the microglia phenotypes in ALS. First, to maximize comparability with our previous study [\nAs it is common with studies utilizing postmortem CNS tissue samples of fast-progressing human diseases, the disease stage of all of the donors at death was terminal. Consequently, the cause of death for all (but one) of the donors was end-stage ALS. One donor (ALS2, Table\nImportantly, we document significant deviation from the observed changes of the microglia population structure in mouse models of this disease.

Interestingly, annotation of this subset of our dataset with the Azimuth PBMC reference [\nDespite the challenges associated with ex-vivo studies of human microglia in ALS, we believe that the approach described here is crucial to understanding of their role in ALS disease pathobiology. Most of the ALS-enriched human microglia phenotypes presented here (e.g. MG2, MG8) have not been recapitulated in murine or in vitro model systems yet. Accordingly, mechanistic studies addressing their role in ALS models are challenging at this moment. Nonetheless, our data set will enable the establishment of translational studies that aim to generate novel in vitro and preclinical model systems in which drug screens targeting specific microglia subsets and/or subset-specific gene/pathways can be performed to halt or slow down ALS disease progression.\nOur dataset offers multiple such potential starting points to pursue for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the neuroimmune component of ALS.

Our study by design incorporates a variety of ALS donors in terms of age, sex, TDP43 and genetic status. We designed our experimental set up as such with the aim to capture a common theme in terms of microglia population structure in ALS—one that transcends other factors that can affect the relative abundance of microglia subsets in this disease. This approach carried the risk of not finding such an overarching pattern of ALS-specific microglia population structure in the set of donors included in this study. Importantly, this was not the case, as all donors showed very similar patterns of microglia subset relative abundances (Figure\nOne characteristic of studies requiring fresh human CNS specimens is the lack of control samples as they are, understandably, very difficult to procure. To circumvent this drawback, we utilized a variety of approaches to best describe the microglia phenotypes in ALS. First, to maximize comparability with our previous study [\nAs it is common with studies utilizing postmortem CNS tissue samples of fast-progressing human diseases, the disease stage of all of the donors at death was terminal. Consequently, the cause of death for all (but one) of the donors was end-stage ALS. One donor (ALS2, Table\nImportantly, we document significant deviation from the observed changes of the microglia population structure in mouse models of this disease. To our surprise, MG7, the human microglia cluster that most closely resembled the murine disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype [\nAn examination of non-microglial immune cells in ALS revealed a preponderance of T cells, as well as relative enrichment of dendritic cells and NK cells in the ALS spinal cord. Interestingly, annotation of this subset of our dataset with the Azimuth PBMC reference [\nDespite the challenges associated with ex-vivo studies of human microglia in ALS, we believe that the approach described here is crucial to understanding of their role in ALS disease pathobiology. Most of the ALS-enriched human microglia phenotypes presented here (e.g. MG2, MG8) have not been recapitulated in murine or in vitro model systems yet. Accordingly, mechanistic studies addressing their role in ALS models are challenging at this moment. Nonetheless, our data set will enable the establishment of translational studies that aim to generate novel in vitro and preclinical model systems in which drug screens targeting specific microglia subsets and/or subset-specific gene/pathways can be performed to halt or slow down ALS disease progression.\nOur dataset offers multiple such potential starting points to pursue for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the neuroimmune component of ALS. To demonstrate the utility of our dataset and provide examples of potential genes/pathways for follow-up, we explored whether these microglia phenotype-specific marker gene sets (Table\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary file1 (XLSX 31 KB)\nSupplementary file2 (XLSX 1873 KB)\nSupplementary file3 (XLSX 13 KB)\nSupplementary file4 (XLS 32 KB)\nSupplementary file5 (XLSX 1139 KB)\nSupplementary file6 (XLSX 49 KB)\nSupplementary file7 (XLSX 58 KB)\nSupplementary file8 (XLSX 642 KB)\nSupplementary file9 (XLSX 767 KB)\nSupplementary file10 (XLSX 9 KB)\nSupplementary file11 (XLSX 3414 KB)\nSupplementary file12 (XLSX 13 KB)\nSupplementary file13 (XLSX 181 KB)\nSupplementary file14 (XLSX 31638 KB)", "topic": "Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis"}
