Historically considered distinct, these conditions are increasingly linked by trigeminal nerve-driven neurogenic inflammation. Activation of trigeminovascular afferents provokes antidromic release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP); beyond mediating migraine pain, these peptides remodel vasculature, immune infiltrates, and extracellular matrix to facilitate GBM invasion. Pre-clinical studies show CGRP and SP up-regulate matrix-metalloproteinases and integrins, while PACAP modulates cAMP–MAPK signalling, collectively promoting perivascular migration and temozolomide resistance. Epidemiological analyses report higher migraine antecedents in patients later diagnosed with brain tumours, and high-resolution MRI frequently localises GBM spread along trigeminal pathways, underscoring anatomical plausibility. Emerging therapeutics mirror these insights: aprepitant (an NK1-receptor antagonist) triggers GBM apoptosis, gepant-class CGRP blockers curb invasive phenotypes, and radiolabelled SP analogues deliver focal alpha-therapy. These discoveries facilitate more precise pathogenetic characterisation, reduce diagnostic uncertainty, and expedite translational drug development. This review synthesises current evidence on trigeminal neurogenic inflammation as a mechanistic conduit between migraine biology and GBM progression, mapping cellular circuits, molecular crosstalk, and translational interventions. By integrating neurobiology, oncology, and pharmacology, we aim to delineate diagnostic blind spots, spotlight drug-repurposing opportunities, and chart a roadmap toward personalised strategies that simultaneously alleviate migraine burden and restrain glioblastoma aggressiveness.", "full_text": "Both migraine and glioma contribute substantially to global neurological disability (\nCentral to migraine pathogenesis is trigeminovascular neurogenic inflammation. Electrical or chemical activation of trigeminal nociceptors provokes a rapid antidromic release of vasoactive neuropeptides—chiefly calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)—from perivascular afferents innervating the dura and cortical vessels (\nIntriguingly, each of these neuropeptides also possesses documented oncological bio-activity within the glioma micro-environment (\nRecognising this overlap, the present review interrogates the hypothesis that trigeminal nerve-driven neurogenic inflammation constitutes a mechanistic bridge between migraine biology and GBM progression. We first dissect the cellular and molecular architecture of trigeminal neurogenic inflammation in migraine, then map how the same mediators and signalling nodes orchestrate GBM invasion. By integrating otherwise disparate literatures, we aim to illuminate novel pathophysiological cross-talk and identify therapeutic targets capable of attenuating both migraine burden and glioblastoma aggressiveness.\nAs shown in\nTrigeminovascular neurogenic inflammation as a bridge between migraine and glioblastoma invasion.\nWithin milliseconds of depolarisation, large-dense-core vesicles at the peripheral terminals fuse and discharge a stereotyped cocktail of neuropeptides (\nThe inflammatory milieu that ensues is not neuron-restricted. SP and CGRP trigger rapid degranulation of dural mast cells; histamine, tumour-necrosis factor-α and tryptase released thereby further sensitise afferents and recruit neutrophils and macrophages, perpetuating the cycle (\nCentral amplification follows. Persistent primary-afferent barrage phosphorylates NMDA receptors and ERK1/2 within the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis; activated microglia and astrocytes liberate brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide, sustaining long-term potentiation of nociceptive neurons and manifesting clinically as cutaneous allodynia (\nTrigeminal neurogenic inflammation represents a dynamic, multi-cellular feed-forward loop in which neuropeptide release, vascular dysfunction, immune cell mobilisation and central sensitisation operate in concert. This finely tuned yet pathologically labile circuitry not only underpins migraine pain but also generates a repertoire of cytokines, proteases and growth factors that reshape the local extracellular matrix. Many of these same mediators—CGRP-driven matrix metalloproteinase induction, SP/NK1-R–mediated mitogenic signalling and PACAP-dependent cyclic-AMP modulation—are co-opted by glioblastoma cells to infiltrate neural parenchyma. Understanding the bidirectional dialogue between trigeminal afferents and their vascular–immune partners therefore offers a conceptual bridge between episodic migraine and malignant glioma invasion.\nThe same neuropeptide circuits that ignite trigeminal neurogenic inflammation are increasingly recognised as oncogenic drivers within the glioblastoma (GBM) micro-environment. Transcriptomic and single-cell atlases show that high-grade gliomas over-express both tachykinin and calcitonin-family G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); notably, neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) and the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR, encoded by CALCRL) track with mesenchymal programmes and shortened survival, underscoring their functional relevance to tumour spread (\nSubstance P (SP) signalling exemplifies this hijacking. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that cleave basement-membrane type IV collagen, laminin and proteoglycans; the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 become fully active when surface-trimmed by the membrane-type protease MT1-MMP (MMP-14) and are opposed by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1/-2). This triad is indispensable for GBM cells to tunnel along myelinated white-matter tracts. GBM cells form an autocrine loop in which neuronal or tumour-derived SP engages NK1-R to activate ERK1/2 and PI3K–Akt, culminating in β-arrestin-1 recruitment, cyclin‐dependent kinase activation and accelerated cell-cycle transit. Pharmacologic or genetic blockade of NK1-R curtails SP-driven chemotaxis, while the clinically approved antagonist aprepitant suppresses lamellipodia dynamics and reduces orthotopic tumour burden\nA parallel axis operates through CGRP and its receptor family. Glioblastoma specimens and cell lines display heightened CLR/RAMP2–3 expression, a configuration better known as the adrenomedullin (ADM) receptor. ADM and CGRP ligation elevates intracellular cAMP, trans-activates JNK, and drives cyclin-D1–dependent proliferation; neutralising ADM antibodies or silencing CLR attenuate spheroid outgrowth and invasion in xenograft models (\nPituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) complete this convergence. High-affinity PAC1/VIP receptors are present on patient-derived GBM cultures; PACAP/VIP exposure modulates cAMP-EPAC-Rap1 and MAPK cascades, finely balancing proliferation and motility in a context-dependent manner. In hypoxia (pO\nDownstream, these receptors converge on a protease-rich programme that sculpts the peritumoural matrix. NK1-R and CLR activation heighten transcription and surface trafficking of gelatinases (MMP-2/-9) and MT-MMPs, while concurrently up-regulating αvβ3 integrin and focal-adhesion kinase phosphorylation, which together enable traction through dense parenchyma (\nNeuropeptide signalling also remodels the immune and vascular niches that guide glioma dispersal. SP induces astrocytoma and microglial release of IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF, cytokines that polarise tumour-associated macrophages toward an M2-like, invasion-supportive phenotype and stimulate endothelial VEGF secretion. Single-cell RNA-seq atlases nevertheless identify KIT+ TPSAB1+ mast-cells in < 2% of immune cells at the invasive edge, hinting that a sparse but responsive mast-cell niche may still release histamine and VEGF in reaction to SP or CGRP. In parallel, CGRP-family peptides relax peri-tumoural arterioles, augmenting shear stress and facilitating perivascular migration of tumour cells (\nThe epidemiological intersection between episodic migraine and malignant glioma, while subtle, is increasingly discernible. A nationwide, population-based case-control analysis of more than 22–000 adults showed that patients subsequently diagnosed with brain tumours were 2.45-times more likely to have carried a prior migraine diagnosis; the association remained significant after excluding migraines recorded within three years of tumour detection and was especially pronounced in men (odds ratio 3.04) (\nNeuro-imaging observations lend anatomical plausibility to this overlap. High-resolution MRI increasingly delineates glioblastoma growth along cisternal and cavernous segments of the trigeminal nerve as well as Meckel’s cave, underscoring the tumour’s capacity to exploit perineural corridors innervated by migraine-relevant afferents (\nAt the molecular interface, glioblastoma co-opts virtually every neuropeptide axis canonically implicated in migraine. Transcriptomic and proteomic surveys confirm over-expression of tachykinin and calcitonin-family G-protein-coupled receptors, with full-length neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R), PAC1, VPAC1/2 and CLR–RAMP isoforms enriched at the invasive margin (\nPharmacological experience from the migraine field further strengthens this bridge. Aprepitant—licensed for chemotherapy-induced emesis and explored for refractory migraine—induces apoptosis in NK1-R-positive glioma cultures and diminishes Akt phosphorylation\nTaken together, epidemiological signals, radiological patterns and convergent neuropeptide circuitry converge on a common narrative: the trigeminovascular system and its inflammatory mediators do not merely coexist with glioblastoma but actively facilitate its permeation through neural and perivascular channels.\nA growing body of translational evidence positions the trigeminal neuropeptide axis as more than an epiphenomenon of tumour-induced pain; instead, it represents a tractable vulnerability that can be co-targeted to blunt glioblastoma (GBM) infiltration while simultaneously alleviating migraine-like symptomatology. The convergence of CGRP, substance P, PACAP and adrenomedullin signalling on matrix-remodelling, angiogenesis and immune polarisation suggests that pharmacological or radiopharmaceutical interruption of these cues could deliver a double therapeutic dividend.\nRepurposing clinically approved antagonists is the most immediate path to bedside impact. Yet BBB pharmacokinetics diverge sharply: anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (~150 kDa) cross an intact barrier at < 0.1% ID, restricting action to regions of contrast enhancement, whereas the lipophilic NK1-antagonist aprepitant (MW ≈ 534 Da, logP ≈ 3.5) reaches CSF-to-plasma ratios of ~0.05—adequate for receptor occupancy but still sub-therapeutic in deeply infiltrated zones. Moreover, chronic CGRP blockade erodes vasodilatory reserve, slows dermal repair, and may blunt dendritic priming—risks that must be balanced during multimodal therapy. Aprepitant, an oral neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) blocker widely used for chemotherapy-induced nausea, induces apoptosis, suppresses lamellipodial dynamics and synergises with 5-aminolevulinic acid in patient-derived GBM cultures (\nWhere systemic small molecules may falter against the blood-brain barrier, peptide-based radiotheranostics offer focal, high-linear-energy transfer delivery. Targeted α-therapy with NK1-directed peptides has yielded encouraging but still preliminary data: the largest 225Ac-DOTA-Substance P dose-escalation study (n = 21, median 3 cycles) reported grade-3 thrombocytopenia in 1/21 patients and a median overall survival (OS) of 9.0 months from first dose, with RANO responses limited to one partial response and seven cases of stable disease. An earlier 213Bi-DOTA-Substance P trial (n = 20, cumulative activity ≤ 11.2 GBq) recorded only transient grade 1/2 toxicities and a 7.5-month median OS from therapy start, again with low objective-response rates (\nAdrenomedullin, a close CGRP family member, exemplifies the broader potential of neuropeptide blockade. Neutralising antibodies or small-molecule antagonists down-regulate JNK–cyclin-D1 signalling, curb spheroid expansion and enhance temozolomide sensitivity in xenografts (\nFuture development will hinge on precise patient stratification.

This finely tuned yet pathologically labile circuitry not only underpins migraine pain but also generates a repertoire of cytokines, proteases and growth factors that reshape the local extracellular matrix. Many of these same mediators—CGRP-driven matrix metalloproteinase induction, SP/NK1-R–mediated mitogenic signalling and PACAP-dependent cyclic-AMP modulation—are co-opted by glioblastoma cells to infiltrate neural parenchyma.

Transcriptomic and single-cell atlases show that high-grade gliomas over-express both tachykinin and calcitonin-family G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); notably, neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) and the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR, encoded by CALCRL) track with mesenchymal programmes and shortened survival, underscoring their functional relevance to tumour spread (\nSubstance P (SP) signalling exemplifies this hijacking. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that cleave basement-membrane type IV collagen, laminin and proteoglycans; the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 become fully active when surface-trimmed by the membrane-type protease MT1-MMP (MMP-14) and are opposed by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1/-2). This triad is indispensable for GBM cells to tunnel along myelinated white-matter tracts. GBM cells form an autocrine loop in which neuronal or tumour-derived SP engages NK1-R to activate ERK1/2 and PI3K–Akt, culminating in β-arrestin-1 recruitment, cyclin‐dependent kinase activation and accelerated cell-cycle transit.

Monoclonal antibodies that block CGRP, or its receptor, have been proven effective in the preventive treatment of chronic migraine (CM) in several large randomised controlled trials [\nNew daily persistent headache (NDPH) is a headache syndrome that differs from CM in that it has a sudden onset and is continuous from the time of onset, often in people without a history of headache, and lasts at least three months [\nIf there is a significant overlap in the pathophysiology of NDPH and CM, then it may be expected that CGRP monoclonal antibodies would also be effective in patients with NDPH, or at least in the group who have migraine characteristics. Patients with NDPH have not been included in previous clinical trials of CGRP monoclonal antibodies, but some patients have anecdotally responded [\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment in patients with NDPH in comparison to daily and non-daily CM.\nWe performed a prospective open-label study including consecutive patients with NDPH and CM who started treatment with CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment between January 2022 and March 2023. Patients were recruited from a single-centre secondary and tertiary headache clinic at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, UK.\nThree groups of patients were included. Group 1 included patients with NDPH, who met ICHD-3 criteria [\nAs patients were treated under the UK National Health Service in accordance with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines [\nPatients were excluded if they had previously received a CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment prior to the study. No other changes to headache medication were made in the three months prior to treatment, or the first three months of CGRP treatment.\nMost patients were treated with subcutaneous erenumab 140 mg once per month for three months. In light of postmarketing evidence suggesting a risk of hypertension with erenumab [\nBaseline information captured included demographics, onset of the headache disorder, comorbidities, and previous treatments that had been trialled.\nA baseline headache diary was used to capture (over a four-week period): number of headache days, number of migraine days according to ICHD-3 criteria [\nPatients were also asked to complete the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) questionnaire of headache related disability [\nThe same headache diary and questionnaires were completed for the 4-week period leading up to a 12 week follow up appointment. At the 12 week follow up patients were also asked to estimate their overall improvement on a scale of 0% (no improvement or worse) to 100% (complete resolution of migraine).\nPatients were able to contact the clinical team with adverse events at any point in the study, and at the 12-week follow-up appointment patients were specifically asked to report any adverse effects.\nThe primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a ≥ 30% improvement in monthly moderate-to-severe headache days compared between the baseline four-week period to the four-week period preceding the 12-week follow-up date, compared between the three groups.\nPlanned secondary outcomes were improvement in headache days, migraine days, headache severity, headache load (a composite measure calculated as the monthly sum of headache VRS multiplied by headache hours for each day), HIT-6 score, EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS), patient’s estimate of improvement, and frequency of adverse events.\nMigraine days were later excluded from the analysis as it was suspected that some patients had not completed this section of the headache diary correctly, and therefore that this variable might not be reliable.\nAll consecutive patients who met eligibility criteria during the period the study were included, and a sample size calculation was not performed. All data were collected prospectively within the clinical service using headache diaries and validated questionnaires. Missing data were not imputed.\nAnalyses were performed in R (R Studio version 4.3.3), IBM SPSS (Version 29.0), and Stata (Version 18).\nDescriptive data were summarised using mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR), depending on the distribution of data. Normality assumptions were assessed based on visual inspection of histograms.\nFor comparison of baseline data between the three groups we used Chi Squared (X\nWhen analysing the outcome measures, comparisons between the three groups were made using the propensity score matching approach to control for imbalances between the three groups. Conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of pre-specified baseline covariates (gender, age, duration of chronic daily headache, number of failed preventive medications, and HAD-D depression score) will be similar between the three groups. Propensity score matching has been proven to be effective in reducing bias in observational studies where there are a number of potential confounders and dimensionality problems arise [\nPropensity scores were estimated using generalized boosted models [\nEstimates of the differences of the outcome measures between the three groups were derived using negative binomial regression for analysis of monthly moderate-to-severe headache days and monthly headache days; linear regression for other continuous outcomes; and logistic regression for responder analysis; using the derived propensity score weights in the regression models.\nFor responder analysis, a greater than or equal to 30% response was used as the cut-off threshold to define responders for each of the outcomes based on headache diary metrics and patient estimate of improvement, and a greater than or equal to a 6-point improvement was used as the cut-off threshold for HIT-6 score.\nAll patients gave informed consent for their anonymised data to be included in the research study. Research ethics committee approval was obtained from the London – Chelsea Research Ethics Committee, reference number 21/PR/0827.\nA total of 48 patients with NDPH and 169 patients with CM (of whom 101 had a daily headache) met inclusion criteria.

As expected, there were fewer females in the NDPH group and medication overuse was less common. Headache diary metrics were similar in the NDPH and daily-CM groups, and lower in non-daily-CM, as expected, as they had fewer headache days by definition. Disability, quality of life, anxiety, and depression scores all appeared worst in the daily-CM group and best in the non-daily CM at baseline, with the NDPH group having intermediate scores. There was a higher proportion of patients with NDPH prescribed erenumab than in both the CM groups (see Table\nA small proportion of patients (one in the NDPH group, two in the daily-CM group, and seven in the non-daily CM group) did not return the 12-week interval diaries, and six NDPH patients, eight daily-CM patients, and nine non-daily CM patients did not return the disability questionnaires.\nIn the NDPH group, 11/47 (23%) of patients had a ≥ 30% improvement in monthly moderate-to-severe headache days.

This showed similar response rates (50% and 45% improvement in moderate-to-severe headache days respectively, χ\nApproximately half of patients experienced at least one adverse effect.

The probability of improvement in the primary outcome measure of moderate-to-severe headache days in NDPH was approximately half of that in daily CM and a quarter of that in non-daily CM.\nThis contrasts with their efficacy in other chronic daily headache syndromes. Anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies are proven to be effective for CM in several randomised controlled trials [\nWe also showed that these treatments are less effective in patients with CM who have a daily headache than those who have between 15–27 headache days per month. This corroborates a previous study that showed that response was 56% in daily-CM and 90% in non-daily CM [\nNo previous study has evaluated the efficacy of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment specifically for NDPH. A retrospective study including 112 adolescents with a mixed population of chronic headache disorders, who were given either erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab, included 12 patients with NDPH [\nThe results of this study showing that CGRP monoclonal antibodies are less likely to be effective in NDPH than CM, suggest that it is possible that CGRP plays less a role in the pathophysiology of primary NDPH than in CM. CGRP is a neuropeptide which is widely expressed throughout the nervous system. Its role in migraine is believed to involve release following activation of trigeminovascular fibres innervating the dura, contributing to the initiation of migraine attacks [\nThe difference in treatment response in this study contrast with a recent study evaluating onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for NDPH compared to daily and non-daily CM using similar methodology where there was no significant difference in headache diary metrics or patient reported improvement between NDPH and either of the CM groups [\nWe showed a high rate of mild adverse effects of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment, although this is comparable to the overall adverse event rate seen in trials of erenumab and galcanezumab in CM [\nDespite limited changes in headache frequency among patients with NDPH, over half reported subjective improvement following treatment with CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and one-third experienced clinically meaningful improvements in disability scores. This discrepancy between objective diary metrics and perceived benefit warrants closer scrutiny. Our findings raise the possibility that CGRP-targeted therapies may confer benefit in NDPH through mechanisms beyond simple attack reduction. Notably, approximately 30 percent of patients experienced a 30 percent or greater reduction in headache severity, suggesting that improvement in pain intensity may contribute meaningfully to perceived clinical benefit. Additionally, symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, cognitive fog, and sensory hypersensitivity, which are frequently reported in NDPH, may also respond to CGRP blockade. Unfortunately, monthly migraine days could not be included in the analysis as intended, and may have reflected this change in non-headache symptoms. Migraine days and non-headache symptoms would be helpful for any future studies to include as outcome measures.\nThe psychological impact of initiating a novel, biologically targeted therapy, particularly in patients with long-standing, treatment-refractory headache, may further influence patient-reported outcomes. The experience of receiving a modern, mechanism-based intervention can foster hope, enhance engagement, and restore a sense of control over the condition, which may in turn amplify perceptions of improvement even in the absence of major objective changes. These observations highlight the importance of including structured evaluation of non-headache symptom domains in future studies of NDPH, to better understand the nature of treatment response and to inform more comprehensive outcome measures.The inability to control for bias is a limitation of the study design and the use of propensity score was an attempt to mimic some of the characteristics of a randomised study. Randomisation avoids systematic differences between groups with respect to known or unknown baseline variables that could affect outcome. As this study was not a randomised controlled trial, there were some differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. As in the previous onabotulinumtoxinA study [\nThe absence of a control arm in this study makes it impossible to discriminate between outcomes that are the consequence of a treatment from those caused by other factors. In particular, the absence of of a placebo group limiting limits absolute conclusions about the true magnitude of treatment effect i.e. about whether there is a mild effect of CGRP monoclonal antibodies in NDPH from being made. The duration of follow up of 12 weeks was chosen due to the NICE criteria under which patients were treated which state that treatment should be stopped after 12 weeks if there is < 30% improvement in headache frequency. It is known that some patients can take > 24 weeks to respond to CGRP monoclonal antibody treatments [\nCGRP monoclonal antibody treatment appears to be less effective in NDPH than CM, particularly patients with CM who do not have a daily headache. This suggests that NDPH should not be regarded as equivalent to CM and that new treatment options are required for treatment-refractory NDPH. However, given the frequently refractory nature of NDPH, a response rate of 23% and mean patient perceived improvement of 34% may still be considered clinically significant.

Monoclonal antibodies that block CGRP, or its receptor, have been proven effective in the preventive treatment of chronic migraine (CM) in several large randomised controlled trials [\nNew daily persistent headache (NDPH) is a headache syndrome that differs from CM in that it has a sudden onset and is continuous from the time of onset, often in people without a history of headache, and lasts at least three months [\nIf there is a significant overlap in the pathophysiology of NDPH and CM, then it may be expected that CGRP monoclonal antibodies would also be effective in patients with NDPH, or at least in the group who have migraine characteristics. Patients with NDPH have not been included in previous clinical trials of CGRP monoclonal antibodies, but some patients have anecdotally responded [\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment in patients with NDPH in comparison to daily and non-daily CM.\nWe performed a prospective open-label study including consecutive patients with NDPH and CM who started treatment with CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment between January 2022 and March 2023. Patients were recruited from a single-centre secondary and tertiary headache clinic at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, UK.\nThree groups of patients were included. Group 1 included patients with NDPH, who met ICHD-3 criteria [\nAs patients were treated under the UK National Health Service in accordance with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines [\nPatients were excluded if they had previously received a CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment prior to the study. No other changes to headache medication were made in the three months prior to treatment, or the first three months of CGRP treatment.\nMost patients were treated with subcutaneous erenumab 140 mg once per month for three months. In light of postmarketing evidence suggesting a risk of hypertension with erenumab [\nBaseline information captured included demographics, onset of the headache disorder, comorbidities, and previous treatments that had been trialled.\nA baseline headache diary was used to capture (over a four-week period): number of headache days, number of migraine days according to ICHD-3 criteria [\nPatients were also asked to complete the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) questionnaire of headache related disability [\nThe same headache diary and questionnaires were completed for the 4-week period leading up to a 12 week follow up appointment. At the 12 week follow up patients were also asked to estimate their overall improvement on a scale of 0% (no improvement or worse) to 100% (complete resolution of migraine).\nPatients were able to contact the clinical team with adverse events at any point in the study, and at the 12-week follow-up appointment patients were specifically asked to report any adverse effects.\nThe primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a ≥ 30% improvement in monthly moderate-to-severe headache days compared between the baseline four-week period to the four-week period preceding the 12-week follow-up date, compared between the three groups.\nPlanned secondary outcomes were improvement in headache days, migraine days, headache severity, headache load (a composite measure calculated as the monthly sum of headache VRS multiplied by headache hours for each day), HIT-6 score, EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS), patient’s estimate of improvement, and frequency of adverse events.\nMigraine days were later excluded from the analysis as it was suspected that some patients had not completed this section of the headache diary correctly, and therefore that this variable might not be reliable.\nAll consecutive patients who met eligibility criteria during the period the study were included, and a sample size calculation was not performed. All data were collected prospectively within the clinical service using headache diaries and validated questionnaires. Missing data were not imputed.\nAnalyses were performed in R (R Studio version 4.3.3), IBM SPSS (Version 29.0), and Stata (Version 18).\nDescriptive data were summarised using mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR), depending on the distribution of data. Normality assumptions were assessed based on visual inspection of histograms.\nFor comparison of baseline data between the three groups we used Chi Squared (X\nWhen analysing the outcome measures, comparisons between the three groups were made using the propensity score matching approach to control for imbalances between the three groups. Conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of pre-specified baseline covariates (gender, age, duration of chronic daily headache, number of failed preventive medications, and HAD-D depression score) will be similar between the three groups. Propensity score matching has been proven to be effective in reducing bias in observational studies where there are a number of potential confounders and dimensionality problems arise [\nPropensity scores were estimated using generalized boosted models [\nEstimates of the differences of the outcome measures between the three groups were derived using negative binomial regression for analysis of monthly moderate-to-severe headache days and monthly headache days; linear regression for other continuous outcomes; and logistic regression for responder analysis; using the derived propensity score weights in the regression models.\nFor responder analysis, a greater than or equal to 30% response was used as the cut-off threshold to define responders for each of the outcomes based on headache diary metrics and patient estimate of improvement, and a greater than or equal to a 6-point improvement was used as the cut-off threshold for HIT-6 score.\nAll patients gave informed consent for their anonymised data to be included in the research study. Research ethics committee approval was obtained from the London – Chelsea Research Ethics Committee, reference number 21/PR/0827.\nA total of 48 patients with NDPH and 169 patients with CM (of whom 101 had a daily headache) met inclusion criteria. Demographics and baseline headache diary results in the three groups are shown in Table\nBaseline demographic and headache characteristics\nF = 1.38\nχ\nH = 2.56\nH = 11.2\nχ\nH = 199\nH = 89.0\nF = 24.6\nF = 40.0\nH = 25.0\nχ\nF = 5.84\nF = 5.41\nF = 4.41\nF = 9.75\nF = 4.31\nχ\nAge distribution was similar between the three groups. As expected, there were fewer females in the NDPH group and medication overuse was less common. Headache diary metrics were similar in the NDPH and daily-CM groups, and lower in non-daily-CM, as expected, as they had fewer headache days by definition. Disability, quality of life, anxiety, and depression scores all appeared worst in the daily-CM group and best in the non-daily CM at baseline, with the NDPH group having intermediate scores. There was a higher proportion of patients with NDPH prescribed erenumab than in both the CM groups (see Table\nA small proportion of patients (one in the NDPH group, two in the daily-CM group, and seven in the non-daily CM group) did not return the 12-week interval diaries, and six NDPH patients, eight daily-CM patients, and nine non-daily CM patients did not return the disability questionnaires.\nIn the NDPH group, 11/47 (23%) of patients had a ≥ 30% improvement in monthly moderate-to-severe headache days. This compared to 46/99 (46%) in daily CM (OR 2.02, 95% CI 0.82–4.97,\nImprovement in moderate-to-severe headache days over first 3 months of treatment\nImprovement in headache days was rare in both NDPH (5/47, 11%) and daily CM (16/99, 16%), compared to 46/61 (75%) in non-daily CM (OR 7.44, 95% CI 1.47–37.8,\nOutcome measures at 12 week follow up and between group comparisons adjusted by propensity score\nProportion of responders for each outcome measure\nPatient estimate of improvement differed between the three groups, in line with the difference in the headache diary metrics, with the NDPH and daily-CM groups experiencing a mean improvement of 34% and 41% respectively, whereas the non-daily CM reported a mean improvement of 65% (coefficient = 6.95, 95% CI 3.52–10.38,\nDue to the imbalance in the proportion of patients who received each drug, a secondary analysis was performed comparing response rates between erenumab and galcanezumab, across all the patients included in the study. This showed similar response rates (50% and 45% improvement in moderate-to-severe headache days respectively, χ\nApproximately half of patients experienced at least one adverse effect. The most common adverse event in all three groups was constipation, affecting almost a quarter of patients overall (see Table\nAdverse events\nBack pain\nDizziness\nFlare of inflammatory arthritis\nPalpitations\nDiarrhoea\nDizziness × 2\nFacial twitching\nVivid dreams\nWeight gain × 2\nWorsening of PoTS symptoms\nAbdominal pain\nBloating\nBreathlessness\nInsomnia\nJoint pain × 3\nLow mood × 2\nMouth ulcers\nNeck stiffness\nSore throat\nTremor\nWeight gain\nThis study has shown that anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies have little effect on headache days, but improvement in moderate-to-severe headache days in approximately one in four patients and a subjective improvement of symptoms in approximately half of patients with NDPH. The probability of improvement in the primary outcome measure of moderate-to-severe headache days in NDPH was approximately half of that in daily CM and a quarter of that in non-daily CM.\nThis contrasts with their efficacy in other chronic daily headache syndromes. Anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies are proven to be effective for CM in several randomised controlled trials [\nWe also showed that these treatments are less effective in patients with CM who have a daily headache than those who have between 15–27 headache days per month. This corroborates a previous study that showed that response was 56% in daily-CM and 90% in non-daily CM [\nNo previous study has evaluated the efficacy of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment specifically for NDPH. A retrospective study including 112 adolescents with a mixed population of chronic headache disorders, who were given either erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab, included 12 patients with NDPH [\nThe results of this study showing that CGRP monoclonal antibodies are less likely to be effective in NDPH than CM, suggest that it is possible that CGRP plays less a role in the pathophysiology of primary NDPH than in CM. CGRP is a neuropeptide which is widely expressed throughout the nervous system. Its role in migraine is believed to involve release following activation of trigeminovascular fibres innervating the dura, contributing to the initiation of migraine attacks [\nThe difference in treatment response in this study contrast with a recent study evaluating onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for NDPH compared to daily and non-daily CM using similar methodology where there was no significant difference in headache diary metrics or patient reported improvement between NDPH and either of the CM groups [\nWe showed a high rate of mild adverse effects of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment, although this is comparable to the overall adverse event rate seen in trials of erenumab and galcanezumab in CM [\nDespite limited changes in headache frequency among patients with NDPH, over half reported subjective improvement following treatment with CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and one-third experienced clinically meaningful improvements in disability scores. This discrepancy between objective diary metrics and perceived benefit warrants closer scrutiny. Our findings raise the possibility that CGRP-targeted therapies may confer benefit in NDPH through mechanisms beyond simple attack reduction. Notably, approximately 30 percent of patients experienced a 30 percent or greater reduction in headache severity, suggesting that improvement in pain intensity may contribute meaningfully to perceived clinical benefit. Additionally, symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, cognitive fog, and sensory hypersensitivity, which are frequently reported in NDPH, may also respond to CGRP blockade. Unfortunately, monthly migraine days could not be included in the analysis as intended, and may have reflected this change in non-headache symptoms. Migraine days and non-headache symptoms would be helpful for any future studies to include as outcome measures.\nThe psychological impact of initiating a novel, biologically targeted therapy, particularly in patients with long-standing, treatment-refractory headache, may further influence patient-reported outcomes. The experience of receiving a modern, mechanism-based intervention can foster hope, enhance engagement, and restore a sense of control over the condition, which may in turn amplify perceptions of improvement even in the absence of major objective changes. These observations highlight the importance of including structured evaluation of non-headache symptom domains in future studies of NDPH, to better understand the nature of treatment response and to inform more comprehensive outcome measures.The inability to control for bias is a limitation of the study design and the use of propensity score was an attempt to mimic some of the characteristics of a randomised study. Randomisation avoids systematic differences between groups with respect to known or unknown baseline variables that could affect outcome. As this study was not a randomised controlled trial, there were some differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. As in the previous onabotulinumtoxinA study [\nThe absence of a control arm in this study makes it impossible to discriminate between outcomes that are the consequence of a treatment from those caused by other factors. In particular, the absence of of a placebo group limiting limits absolute conclusions about the true magnitude of treatment effect i.e. about whether there is a mild effect of CGRP monoclonal antibodies in NDPH from being made. The duration of follow up of 12 weeks was chosen due to the NICE criteria under which patients were treated which state that treatment should be stopped after 12 weeks if there is < 30% improvement in headache frequency. It is known that some patients can take > 24 weeks to respond to CGRP monoclonal antibody treatments [\nCGRP monoclonal antibody treatment appears to be less effective in NDPH than CM, particularly patients with CM who do not have a daily headache. This suggests that NDPH should not be regarded as equivalent to CM and that new treatment options are required for treatment-refractory NDPH. However, given the frequently refractory nature of NDPH, a response rate of 23% and mean patient perceived improvement of 34% may still be considered clinically significant. Given the limitations inherent to the study design, the effect of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment in NDPH should be formally evaluated in randomised controlled studies. A greater understanding of the pathophysiological basis of NDPH and its relationship to other primary headache disorders would aid the development of new treatment approaches.", "topic": "Migraine"}

Historically considered distinct, these conditions are increasingly linked by trigeminal nerve-driven neurogenic inflammation. Activation of trigeminovascular afferents provokes antidromic release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP); beyond mediating migraine pain, these peptides remodel vasculature, immune infiltrates, and extracellular matrix to facilitate GBM invasion. Pre-clinical studies show CGRP and SP up-regulate matrix-metalloproteinases and integrins, while PACAP modulates cAMP–MAPK signalling, collectively promoting perivascular migration and temozolomide resistance. Epidemiological analyses report higher migraine antecedents in patients later diagnosed with brain tumours, and high-resolution MRI frequently localises GBM spread along trigeminal pathways, underscoring anatomical plausibility. Emerging therapeutics mirror these insights: aprepitant (an NK1-receptor antagonist) triggers GBM apoptosis, gepant-class CGRP blockers curb invasive phenotypes, and radiolabelled SP analogues deliver focal alpha-therapy. These discoveries facilitate more precise pathogenetic characterisation, reduce diagnostic uncertainty, and expedite translational drug development. This review synthesises current evidence on trigeminal neurogenic inflammation as a mechanistic conduit between migraine biology and GBM progression, mapping cellular circuits, molecular crosstalk, and translational interventions.

Persistent primary-afferent barrage phosphorylates NMDA receptors and ERK1/2 within the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis; activated microglia and astrocytes liberate brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide, sustaining long-term potentiation of nociceptive neurons and manifesting clinically as cutaneous allodynia (\nTrigeminal neurogenic inflammation represents a dynamic, multi-cellular feed-forward loop in which neuropeptide release, vascular dysfunction, immune cell mobilisation and central sensitisation operate in concert. This finely tuned yet pathologically labile circuitry not only underpins migraine pain but also generates a repertoire of cytokines, proteases and growth factors that reshape the local extracellular matrix. Many of these same mediators—CGRP-driven matrix metalloproteinase induction, SP/NK1-R–mediated mitogenic signalling and PACAP-dependent cyclic-AMP modulation—are co-opted by glioblastoma cells to infiltrate neural parenchyma. Understanding the bidirectional dialogue between trigeminal afferents and their vascular–immune partners therefore offers a conceptual bridge between episodic migraine and malignant glioma invasion.\nThe same neuropeptide circuits that ignite trigeminal neurogenic inflammation are increasingly recognised as oncogenic drivers within the glioblastoma (GBM) micro-environment. Transcriptomic and single-cell atlases show that high-grade gliomas over-express both tachykinin and calcitonin-family G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); notably, neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) and the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR, encoded by CALCRL) track with mesenchymal programmes and shortened survival, underscoring their functional relevance to tumour spread (\nSubstance P (SP) signalling exemplifies this hijacking. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that cleave basement-membrane type IV collagen, laminin and proteoglycans; the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 become fully active when surface-trimmed by the membrane-type protease MT1-MMP (MMP-14) and are opposed by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1/-2). This triad is indispensable for GBM cells to tunnel along myelinated white-matter tracts. GBM cells form an autocrine loop in which neuronal or tumour-derived SP engages NK1-R to activate ERK1/2 and PI3K–Akt, culminating in β-arrestin-1 recruitment, cyclin‐dependent kinase activation and accelerated cell-cycle transit.

SP induces astrocytoma and microglial release of IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF, cytokines that polarise tumour-associated macrophages toward an M2-like, invasion-supportive phenotype and stimulate endothelial VEGF secretion. Single-cell RNA-seq atlases nevertheless identify KIT+ TPSAB1+ mast-cells in < 2% of immune cells at the invasive edge, hinting that a sparse but responsive mast-cell niche may still release histamine and VEGF in reaction to SP or CGRP.

The convergence of CGRP, substance P, PACAP and adrenomedullin signalling on matrix-remodelling, angiogenesis and immune polarisation suggests that pharmacological or radiopharmaceutical interruption of these cues could deliver a double therapeutic dividend.\nRepurposing clinically approved antagonists is the most immediate path to bedside impact.

Moreover, chronic CGRP blockade erodes vasodilatory reserve, slows dermal repair, and may blunt dendritic priming—risks that must be balanced during multimodal therapy. Aprepitant, an oral neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) blocker widely used for chemotherapy-induced nausea, induces apoptosis, suppresses lamellipodial dynamics and synergises with 5-aminolevulinic acid in patient-derived GBM cultures (\nWhere systemic small molecules may falter against the blood-brain barrier, peptide-based radiotheranostics offer focal, high-linear-energy transfer delivery.

Aprepitant, an oral neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) blocker widely used for chemotherapy-induced nausea, induces apoptosis, suppresses lamellipodial dynamics and synergises with 5-aminolevulinic acid in patient-derived GBM cultures (\nWhere systemic small molecules may falter against the blood-brain barrier, peptide-based radiotheranostics offer focal, high-linear-energy transfer delivery.

We did a triple-blinded, multi-site, randomized non-inferiority trial in Nigeria (PACTR202206754734018). Adults 18–65 years received full, half, or quarter primary doses of ChAdOx1 or Ad26.COV2.S, or full vs half doses of BNT162b2. Primary study outcome was seroconversion defined as ≥ 2.5-fold rise in anti-Spike IgG geometric-mean fold rise (GMFR) at day 28. A total of 1894 participants were enrolled between June 21, 2022, and January 25, 2023. 320 participants in the fractional dose group and 220 in the standard dose group completed follow-up and were included in the analysis. Seropositivity at baseline was high, at 68% (365/539). Seroconversion was comparable between standard and fractional doses (p = 0.822). For ChAdOx1, 31% achieved seroconversion at standard dose (16/52), 28% at half-dose (15/53), and 34% in quarter-dose (18/53).

Here, we present the first such randomized data from sub-Saharan Africa, evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of fractional doses of the ChadOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, and BNT162b2 vaccines among healthy Nigerian adults. We hypothesize that fractional doses of ChadOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, and BNT162b2 SARS COV-2 vaccines will elicit an immune response non-inferior to full doses while maintaining a similar safety profile. In this context, non-inferiority means that the immune response generated by the fractional dose is not significantly worse than that produced by the full dose. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate non-inferiority in seroconversion rates, defined as geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) ≥ 2.5 in serum anti-spike IgG titre at 28 days post-vaccination. Immunogenicity analysis included measurement of pseudotype neutralization responses.\nWe conducted a multi-site, randomized, triple-blind, non-inferiority trial across five sites in five of Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones. The study sites were Aminu Kano University Teaching Hospital, Kano (Northwest), National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD), Abuja, Federal Capital Territory (North Central), Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, (NAUTH), Anambra (South-East), Delta State University Teaching Hospital (DELSUTH), Delta, (South-South) and the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Lagos (Southwest).\nParticipants eligible for recruitment were adults (18 – 65 years). Exclusion criteria were: (i) previous SARS COV-2 infection defined by IgM anti-N positivity ii) pregnancy and breastfeeding iii) debilitating disease conditions or severe allergic reactions iv) previous COVID-19 vaccination v) current treatment with an investigational agent for prophylactic COVID-19 vi) individuals who were likely to travel during the study period.

The study participants were withdrawn without replacement during the visit if they were pregnant or voluntary withdrawal with appropriate documentation.\nThree COVID-19 vaccines (ChadOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, and BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines) were used for the trial (Table\nBaseline characteristics of the study population based on the primary vaccine dose (n = 540).\n18–55 years\n56–65 years\n147(93.0)\n11(7.0)\n125(90.6)\n13(9.4)\n218(89.3)\n26(10.7)\nThe Ad26.COV2.S and BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines have pre- and post-thawing temperature storage and shelf-life conditions. Ad26.COV2.S and BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines were originally stored at -90 °C to -60 °C and -25 °C respectively at the national cold storage facility by the NPHCDA after which they were thawed and then distributed at 2—8 °C to the various study sites. The BNT162b2 vaccine required reconstitution with a diluent (Sodium Chloride injection 0.9% USP) before use. The ChadOx1 vaccine was originally stored and distributed at 2—8 °C. At study sites, temperature of the vaccine storage refrigerators were charted twice daily, and the recordings were documented. All the vaccines have a shelf life of 6 h once a vial is opened, a new expiry time is calculated and documented and the left over from the multi-vials were discarded after 6 h.\nStandardized and calibrated syringes of 0.3 mL, 0.5 mL and 1 mL capacity were used to withdraw and prepare the prefilled full and fractional doses of the vaccines as required. All prefilled and reconstituted vaccines were kept at 2—8 °C in vaccine carriers with thermometers until ready for use. The model employed in this study for vaccine administration was such that the trial pharmacists prepared a pre-filled syringe of the full or fractional doses (quarter (25%) or half (50%) doses) just before administration and then handed over to the study nurse for administration to the trial participants. The vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the upper arm in the deltoid muscle with either 0.3 mL, 0.5 mL or 1 mL auto-disable syringes (detachable needle size 23G × 1 ¼’) at 90° injection angle.\nBlood samples were collected at the different sites. The samples for serological analysis were duly labelled and temporarily stored in 0.5 mL aliquots at -20° C freezers. The samples were transported (airfreight) on dry ice in insulated Styrofoam packs from the sentinel laboratories to the SIFCoVAN Central Laboratory at NIMR, Lagos within 4 weeks of sample collection. The duration of sample transportation were about 60–120 min. However, complete blood count, electrolyte, urea, creatinine, liver function test and urinalysis were done at the enrolment sites based on routine clinical care and best practices. The generated results from the assay were entered into the case report form and then into the study database (web-based version of RedCap\nA solid-phase sandwich Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine the concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the serum samples of each of the healthy volunteers vaccinated with standard or fractional doses of the tested COVID-19 vaccines at baseline (day 0) and the different time points in the study. After the collection of whole blood (5 mL) into a plain tube, serum was recovered by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature and transferred to a new pre-labelled plain tube. Ten microlitres of the recovered serum were used immediately or stored at -20 °C in preparation for ELISA screening. The ELISA assay detects IgG antibodies directed against the viral spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) and 0.89 U/ml was used as the cut-off value for qualitative determination of antibody positivity at baseline. For the quantitative assay, each serum sample was pre-diluted 100-fold (1: 99 v/v) in assay buffer and used for analysis according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vienna Austria) using the Human SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Trimer) IgG sandwich ELISA kit (Catalog Number BMS2325, Lot Number 359554016).\nIn a subset of participants with paired available sampling across baseline(F0), Day 28 or week 4 (F1) and Week 8 or 24 (F3) time points (n = 64), we assessed binding antibodies using the highly sensitive Luminex assay.

The minimum sample size per vaccine arm was 137, in addition to a 10% attrition rate, with a final sample size of 151 per vaccine arm. Except for BNT162B2 vaccine (50% and 100% standard interval, and 100% extended interval), each vaccine had 4 arms (25%, 50%, 100% (all standard interval), and 100% extended interval). The total sample size was 1,812 study participants. Figure\nImmunogenicity was evaluated by measuring the geometric mean concentration (GMCs) of SARS-COV2 antibodies at baseline and at 28 days post-vaccination time point, and their ratios were estimated. Next, we estimated the percentage of participants who achieved seroconversion, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the exact Clopper-Pearson method by vaccine dose and type. Seroconversion was defined as a Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) of ≥ 2.5. To assess the non-inferiority of the seroconversion rates, we estimated the point difference between the fractional and standard dose arms with 95% CIs using the Wilson score method. Fractional doses were considered non-inferior if the lower bound of the confidence interval (CI) for the difference in seroconversion exceeded 20% (Fig.\nPrimary outcome analysis and adverse events among the aggregated study participants (n = 540)\nThe study protocol was approved by the National Health Research Ethics Committee of Nigeria (NHREC/01/01/2007- 28/11/2021) and approval for the conduct of the clinical trial in the country was granted by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC/DER/VCTD/SIFCoVAN/2022).

Study participants (n = 465) on the extended vaccine dose were excluded from this analysis bringing sample size to 1429. Included in the analysis for ChadOx1 arm, were 152, 151 and 167 participants for the standard, quarter and half fractional doses respectively. For the Ad26.COV2.S arm, 154, 237 and 165 study participants were allotted to the standard, quarter and half fractional doses respectively. For the BNT162b2 vaccine arm, 187 and 216 study participants were assigned to the standard and half fractional dose respectively. The attrition rate was 59% by the day 28 visit.\nThe primary outcome analysis per protocol included 320 participants in the fractional dose group and 220 in the standard dose group (Supplementary Table 2). The mean age (SD) of the participants was 36.7 (13.2) years with a female-to-male distribution of 1.5:1. The mean age (SD) of the participants in the quarter, half, and full dose arms (irrespective of the vaccine type) were 34.0 (± 13.1), 33.9 (± 12.9) and 35.1(± 12.9) years respectively. Three hundred and sixty-five out of five hundred and forty (67.6%) participants had a positive SARS-COV-2 antibody at baseline. The proportion of participants with positive SARS-COV-2 antibodies at baseline was found to be approximately equally distributed across the arms- quarter dose (69.4%), half dose (66.2%) and full dose (68.2%).

A total of one hundred and seventy-five study participants reported at least one adverse event occurring within the 72 h following COVID-19 vaccine administration, irrespective of the study arm. The common adverse events, irrespective of the vaccine arm, were pain at the injection site (72.6%), fever (18.3%), tiredness (17.1%), and body aches (11.4%), (Fig.\nWe conducted a sub-analysis of binding antibody analysis in (n = 64) participants with paired samples available at F0, F1 and F3 comprising (n = 8) participants each across all eight vaccine groups. We first characterized at baseline, the proportion of these participants who were previously exposed to SARS COV-2 and SARS COV-2 Omicron variant defined by positivity to IgG anti-N and IgG anti-RBD Omicron using the Luminex assay. We observed 52/64 (81%) and 60/64 (94%) participants positive for IgG anti-N and IgG anti-RBD Omicron. We also observed 62/64 (97%), 61/64 (95%) and 62/64 (97%) for IgG anti-Spike (S), IgG Wu-1 anti-Receptor Binding Domain (Wu-1 RBD) and Wu-1 anti-Spike-1 (Wu-1 S1) respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). We then characterized vaccine breakthrough infection in this subset of participants by assessing proportion of participants with a ≥ twofold increase in IgG anti-N during follow up time points relative to baseline or the preceding timepoint. We found that around a quarter of participants (17/64; 26%) experiencing a vaccine breakthrough infection.\nWe further characterized neutralizing antibody responses in (n = 62) participants with sufficient samples available at F0, F1 and F3 for analysis. This comprised (n = 8) participants from all vaccine groups, other than half-dose Ad26.COV2.S group which has (n = 6) participants. In our neutralization analysis across the eight vaccine groups, the median pre-vaccination geometric mean neutralization titer (GMT) against Wu-1 wild-type virus was 1473 (IQR 1242–2215). We observed similar rates of enhancement across the three vaccine types and doses following prime and booster doses (Figs.\nAntibody responses to vaccination with BNT162b2 at full and half doses.\nAntibody responses to vaccination with ChadOX1 at full, half and quarter doses.\nAntibody responses to vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S at full, half and quarter doses.\nThis study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of fractional doses of three vaccines (ChadOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, and BNT162b2 vaccines) in Nigeria using a randomized triple-blinded non-inferiority clinical trial design. At 28 days post vaccination a total of 177 of 540 (21.7%) achieved seroconversion with the GMFR > 2.5-fold rise in SARS-COV-2 antibody titre. In the ChadOx1 vaccine arm, the difference in seroconversion rates were -2.5% (95% CI: -19.9 to 15.0) for the half dose vs. full dose, and 3.2% (95% CI: -14.7 to 20.9) for the quarter vs Full dose and the in the Ad26.COV2.S vaccines the differences in the seroconversion were 5.7% (95% CI: -8.0 to 19.9) for the half dose vs. full dose and 2.9% (95% CI: -10.3 to 16.8) for the quarter vs. full dose. Both fractional doses were considered non-inferior to the full doses. However, in the BNT162b2 vaccine arm, the fractional dose did not quite meet the non-inferiority criteria with a difference of -4.2% (95% CI: -20.5 to 12.1). No adverse events or severe adverse events were reported as the vaccines were safe and well-tolerated.\nIn this current study, the (quarter and half) fractional doses of ChadOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines induced adequate immune response among the participants similar to the full dose (standard dose) of the corresponding vaccines at day 28. The non-inferiority of the fractional doses to the full dose of the vaccines and the similarity in the participants who had adequate immunogenic response buttresses previous data coupled with predictive models of the efficacy of fractional doses of COVID-19 vaccines\nIn a subset of participants (32% of the study population) who were noted to be seronegative at baseline for anti-S IgG, it was noteworthy that 63% achieved seroconversion after receiving fractional vaccine doses across the three vaccines. The immunogenicity in this subpopulation was higher than seroconversion rates in the study population at 21.7%. The difference in seroconversion rates observed in the two groups may be attributed to a ceiling effect where antibody titres were near their peak due to repeated infections prior to vaccination in the group seropositive at baseline. This finding is consistent with results from the UK and Israel, which described a ceiling or maximum S-RBD antibody titre level for antibody response\nIn our sub-analysis of participants with longitudinal data across three-time points, vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody and binding antibody responses were evaluated. We observed endemic level exposure to SARS CoV-2 characterized by positivity for IgG anti-N in 81% of participants at study entry and even higher levels for Omicron BA.1. This indicates extensive recent transmission of SARS CoV-2 virus before vaccination. The high degree of exposure is not surprising given that previous studies in the population observed 25% of SARS CoV-2 seroprevalence in 2020, almost 50% exposure rates in 2021\nThe incidence of the reported adverse events in the trial was 9.1% and no severe adverse event was reported. This could be explained by the significant number of individuals who had developed immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 infection even though there was no previous history of infection and none of the participants had acute COVID-19 infection at enrolment. The incidence of adverse events reported is lower relative to trials in the region\nThe common adverse events (irrespective of the vaccine arm or dose) were pain at the injection site, fever, tiredness, and body aches. These agree with reports by the World Health Organization and other previous studies in Nigeria\nThe pre-vaccination seroprevalence among the study participants at 67.6% aligns with recent studies conducted in Nigeria. Our seroprevalence is similar to that reported by Akanmu et al. (60.3%) in Lagos\nThis study was subject to limitations. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to report the safety and immunogenicity of fractional doses of primary course COVID-19 vaccines in sub-Saharan Africa, evaluating fractional doses of three approved COVID-19 vaccines used globally during the pandemic. While the trial also provides the advantage of having access to a large cohort of heterogeneous participants in a multi-site study such as this, the relatively modest sample size within individual arms and the high attrition rate during follow-up period significantly reduces the power to the generalizability of the outcome. This issue mirrors other studies that reported high attrition rates in Nigeria, Ghana and other sub-Saharan African countries on the completion of COVID-19 primary series vaccination\nThe study showed that the fractional doses of ChadOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines were immunogenic and not inferior to their corresponding standard doses in the context of a population with high rate of prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the context of this trial has shifted with improved SARS COV-2 vaccine coverage and withdrawal of the ChadOx1 from commercial use, the principles, implications and operational logic remains highly relevant for public health responses with significant implications for global immunization strategy and pandemic response frameworks\n\nSupplementary Information.", "content_for_embedding": "The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which began in December 2019, rapidly spread globally and resulted in over 700 million reported cases and approximately 7 million deaths\nLimited access to vaccines across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has limited the potential impact and benefit of vaccination in these settings, emphasizing the need for global vaccine equity and coverage\nIn the context of COVID-19 vaccination, studies from high-income countries show that fractional doses of mRNA vaccines could provide a robust immune response against COVID-19\nTo date, no randomized trials have evaluated fractional doses for primary vaccination beyond pharmaceutical registration studies conducted largely in high-income settings.

Clinical evaluation were done at baseline and follow-up visits at days 28, 42, 56, and 84 for ChadOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines (Days 28, 84, 180, and 252 for BNT162b2 vaccine); Fig.\nBlood samples were collected at baseline and follow-up visits. The study participants were withdrawn without replacement during the visit if they were pregnant or voluntary withdrawal with appropriate documentation.\nThree COVID-19 vaccines (ChadOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, and BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines) were used for the trial (Table\nBaseline characteristics of the study population based on the primary vaccine dose (n = 540).\n18–55 years\n56–65 years\n147(93.0)\n11(7.0)\n125(90.6)\n13(9.4)\n218(89.3)\n26(10.7)\nThe Ad26.COV2.S and BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines have pre- and post-thawing temperature storage and shelf-life conditions. Ad26.COV2.S and BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines were originally stored at -90 °C to -60 °C and -25 °C respectively at the national cold storage facility by the NPHCDA after which they were thawed and then distributed at 2—8 °C to the various study sites. The BNT162b2 vaccine required reconstitution with a diluent (Sodium Chloride injection 0.9% USP) before use. The ChadOx1 vaccine was originally stored and distributed at 2—8 °C. At study sites, temperature of the vaccine storage refrigerators were charted twice daily, and the recordings were documented. All the vaccines have a shelf life of 6 h once a vial is opened, a new expiry time is calculated and documented and the left over from the multi-vials were discarded after 6 h.\nStandardized and calibrated syringes of 0.3 mL, 0.5 mL and 1 mL capacity were used to withdraw and prepare the prefilled full and fractional doses of the vaccines as required. All prefilled and reconstituted vaccines were kept at 2—8 °C in vaccine carriers with thermometers until ready for use. The model employed in this study for vaccine administration was such that the trial pharmacists prepared a pre-filled syringe of the full or fractional doses (quarter (25%) or half (50%) doses) just before administration and then handed over to the study nurse for administration to the trial participants. The vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the upper arm in the deltoid muscle with either 0.3 mL, 0.5 mL or 1 mL auto-disable syringes (detachable needle size 23G × 1 ¼’) at 90° injection angle.\nBlood samples were collected at the different sites. The samples for serological analysis were duly labelled and temporarily stored in 0.5 mL aliquots at -20° C freezers. The samples were transported (airfreight) on dry ice in insulated Styrofoam packs from the sentinel laboratories to the SIFCoVAN Central Laboratory at NIMR, Lagos within 4 weeks of sample collection. The duration of sample transportation were about 60–120 min. However, complete blood count, electrolyte, urea, creatinine, liver function test and urinalysis were done at the enrolment sites based on routine clinical care and best practices. The generated results from the assay were entered into the case report form and then into the study database (web-based version of RedCap\nA solid-phase sandwich Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine the concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the serum samples of each of the healthy volunteers vaccinated with standard or fractional doses of the tested COVID-19 vaccines at baseline (day 0) and the different time points in the study. After the collection of whole blood (5 mL) into a plain tube, serum was recovered by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature and transferred to a new pre-labelled plain tube. Ten microlitres of the recovered serum were used immediately or stored at -20 °C in preparation for ELISA screening. The ELISA assay detects IgG antibodies directed against the viral spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) and 0.89 U/ml was used as the cut-off value for qualitative determination of antibody positivity at baseline. For the quantitative assay, each serum sample was pre-diluted 100-fold (1: 99 v/v) in assay buffer and used for analysis according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vienna Austria) using the Human SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Trimer) IgG sandwich ELISA kit (Catalog Number BMS2325, Lot Number 359554016).\nIn a subset of participants with paired available sampling across baseline(F0), Day 28 or week 4 (F1) and Week 8 or 24 (F3) time points (n = 64), we assessed binding antibodies using the highly sensitive Luminex assay. We measured binding antibodies against SARS-COV-2 trimeric spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), Wu-1 D614G and Omicron (BA.1) specific receptor-binding domain (RBD) as previously described which were validated using pre-pandemic samples\nNeutralizing antibodies were measured using the SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudovirus (PV) technique; this was prepared by transfecting HEK293T cells with Wu-1-614G wild type (WT), BA.1, BA.2 and XBB plasmids in conjunction with p8.91 HIV-1 gag-pol expression vectors as previously described\nStatistical analysis was performed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of fractional doses of the ChAdOx1, AD26.COV2.S, and BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines.\nSample size calculation: The sample size calculation was done based on the primary outcome using the following assumptions: power (1—beta) at 80%, significance level (alpha) at 5%, percentage success in the control group (100% dosing arm) at 92%, percentage success in the experimental arm at 80%, and the non-inferiority limit (d) set at 20. The minimum sample size per vaccine arm was 137, in addition to a 10% attrition rate, with a final sample size of 151 per vaccine arm. Except for BNT162B2 vaccine (50% and 100% standard interval, and 100% extended interval), each vaccine had 4 arms (25%, 50%, 100% (all standard interval), and 100% extended interval). The total sample size was 1,812 study participants. Figure\nImmunogenicity was evaluated by measuring the geometric mean concentration (GMCs) of SARS-COV2 antibodies at baseline and at 28 days post-vaccination time point, and their ratios were estimated. Next, we estimated the percentage of participants who achieved seroconversion, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the exact Clopper-Pearson method by vaccine dose and type. Seroconversion was defined as a Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) of ≥ 2.5. To assess the non-inferiority of the seroconversion rates, we estimated the point difference between the fractional and standard dose arms with 95% CIs using the Wilson score method. Fractional doses were considered non-inferior if the lower bound of the confidence interval (CI) for the difference in seroconversion exceeded 20% (Fig.\nPrimary outcome analysis and adverse events among the aggregated study participants (n = 540)\nThe study protocol was approved by the National Health Research Ethics Committee of Nigeria (NHREC/01/01/2007- 28/11/2021) and approval for the conduct of the clinical trial in the country was granted by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC/DER/VCTD/SIFCoVAN/2022). In addition, all the trial sites obtained ethical approval from their respective local ethics committee [Institutional Review Board (IRB), Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (IRB-22–016), Ministry of Health, Kano State (NHREC/17/03/2018), Health Research Ethics Committee, Delta State University Teaching Hospital (HREC/PAN/2022/021/0469), NIPRD Health Research Ethics Committee (NHREC/039/21A), and NAUTH Health Research Ethics Committee (NAUTH/CS/66/VOL.15/VER.3/053/2022/036)]. According to the Declaration of Helsinki, the trial complied with good clinical practice guidelines. The protocol was registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR) with approval number PACTR 202206754734018.\nThe study’s funder had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\nA total of 2491 study participants were screened between June 21, 2022, and January 25, 2023. 1894 study participants were eligible and assigned to the vaccine arms (ChadOx1 n = 611; Ad26.COV2.S n = 706; BNT162b2 n = 577, Supplementary Table 1). Study participants (n = 465) on the extended vaccine dose were excluded from this analysis bringing sample size to 1429. Included in the analysis for ChadOx1 arm, were 152, 151 and 167 participants for the standard, quarter and half fractional doses respectively. For the Ad26.COV2.S arm, 154, 237 and 165 study participants were allotted to the standard, quarter and half fractional doses respectively. For the BNT162b2 vaccine arm, 187 and 216 study participants were assigned to the standard and half fractional dose respectively. The attrition rate was 59% by the day 28 visit.\nThe primary outcome analysis per protocol included 320 participants in the fractional dose group and 220 in the standard dose group (Supplementary Table 2). The mean age (SD) of the participants was 36.7 (13.2) years with a female-to-male distribution of 1.5:1. The mean age (SD) of the participants in the quarter, half, and full dose arms (irrespective of the vaccine type) were 34.0 (± 13.1), 33.9 (± 12.9) and 35.1(± 12.9) years respectively. Three hundred and sixty-five out of five hundred and forty (67.6%) participants had a positive SARS-COV-2 antibody at baseline. The proportion of participants with positive SARS-COV-2 antibodies at baseline was found to be approximately equally distributed across the arms- quarter dose (69.4%), half dose (66.2%) and full dose (68.2%). (p = 0.822) (Table\nAt 28 days post-vaccination, 177 out of 540 participants (21.7%) showed a GMFR ≥ 2.5-fold-rise in anti-SARS-COV-2 titre from baseline irrespective of the vaccine arm or dose.

The difference in seroconversion rates were -2.5% (95% CI: -19.9 to 15.0) for the half dose vs. full dose, and 3.2% (95% CI: -14.7 to 20.9) for the quarter vs full dose, with both fractional doses meeting the non-inferiority criteria. Among study participants in the Ad26.COV2.S vaccines, 26.7%, 30.9%, and 29.6% in the full, half and quarter doses of the vaccine achieved seroconversion. The differences in the seroconversion were 5.7% (95% CI: -8.0 to 19.9) for the half dose vs. full dose and 2.9% (95% CI: -10.3 to 16.8) for the quarter vs. full dose; with both fractional doses considered non-inferior to the full dose. In the BNT162b2 vaccine arm, 44.4% and 40% of the participants in the full and half dose had a GMFR ≥ 2.5-fold-rise (Table\nOn sub-analysis of the participants with negative serostatus for anti-SARS-COV-2 at baseline, 112 of 177 (63.3%) seroconverted with a GMFR ≥ 2.5-fold-rise compared to the lower limit of detection, irrespective of the vaccine arm or dose. In the ChadOx1 vaccines arm, 68.8%, 80% and 66.7% of the participants in the full, half and quarter doses of the vaccine achieved seroconversion. The difference in seroconversion rates were -10.3% (95% CI: -40 to 23.4) for the half dose vs. full dose, and 6.4% (95% CI: -35.9 to 26.2) for the quarter vs full dose, with both fractional doses not meeting the non-inferiority criteria. Among the participants in the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine group, 60.7%, 61.9%, and 47.6% of the participants in the full, half and quarter doses of the vaccine achieved seroconversion. The differences in the seroconversion were 9.1% (95% CI: -19.7 to 36) for the half dose vs. full dose and 1.6% (95% CI: 29.2 to 30.9) for the quarter vs. full dose; with both fractional doses failing to reach non-inferiority compared to the full dose. In the BNT162b2 vaccine arm, 60% and 63.3% of the participants in the full and half dose seroconverted, though half dose did not meet the non-inferiority criteria with a difference of -3.7% (95% CI: -28.1 to 21.2; Fig.\nSARS-CoV-2 Spike specific binding IgG responses in the study population per arm and vaccine type following one dose in those seronegative at baseline.\n*Defined as increase in IgG above assay threshold.\nA total of 929/1429 participants were evaluated for adverse events (AE), based on phone call responses within 72 h. A total of one hundred and seventy-five study participants reported at least one adverse event occurring within the 72 h following COVID-19 vaccine administration, irrespective of the study arm. The common adverse events, irrespective of the vaccine arm, were pain at the injection site (72.6%), fever (18.3%), tiredness (17.1%), and body aches (11.4%), (Fig.\nWe conducted a sub-analysis of binding antibody analysis in (n = 64) participants with paired samples available at F0, F1 and F3 comprising (n = 8) participants each across all eight vaccine groups. We first characterized at baseline, the proportion of these participants who were previously exposed to SARS COV-2 and SARS COV-2 Omicron variant defined by positivity to IgG anti-N and IgG anti-RBD Omicron using the Luminex assay. We observed 52/64 (81%) and 60/64 (94%) participants positive for IgG anti-N and IgG anti-RBD Omicron. We also observed 62/64 (97%), 61/64 (95%) and 62/64 (97%) for IgG anti-Spike (S), IgG Wu-1 anti-Receptor Binding Domain (Wu-1 RBD) and Wu-1 anti-Spike-1 (Wu-1 S1) respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). We then characterized vaccine breakthrough infection in this subset of participants by assessing proportion of participants with a ≥ twofold increase in IgG anti-N during follow up time points relative to baseline or the preceding timepoint. We found that around a quarter of participants (17/64; 26%) experiencing a vaccine breakthrough infection.\nWe further characterized neutralizing antibody responses in (n = 62) participants with sufficient samples available at F0, F1 and F3 for analysis. This comprised (n = 8) participants from all vaccine groups, other than half-dose Ad26.COV2.S group which has (n = 6) participants. In our neutralization analysis across the eight vaccine groups, the median pre-vaccination geometric mean neutralization titer (GMT) against Wu-1 wild-type virus was 1473 (IQR 1242–2215). We observed similar rates of enhancement across the three vaccine types and doses following prime and booster doses (Figs.\nAntibody responses to vaccination with BNT162b2 at full and half doses.\nAntibody responses to vaccination with ChadOX1 at full, half and quarter doses.\nAntibody responses to vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S at full, half and quarter doses.\nThis study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of fractional doses of three vaccines (ChadOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, and BNT162b2 vaccines) in Nigeria using a randomized triple-blinded non-inferiority clinical trial design. At 28 days post vaccination a total of 177 of 540 (21.7%) achieved seroconversion with the GMFR > 2.5-fold rise in SARS-COV-2 antibody titre. In the ChadOx1 vaccine arm, the difference in seroconversion rates were -2.5% (95% CI: -19.9 to 15.0) for the half dose vs. full dose, and 3.2% (95% CI: -14.7 to 20.9) for the quarter vs Full dose and the in the Ad26.COV2.S vaccines the differences in the seroconversion were 5.7% (95% CI: -8.0 to 19.9) for the half dose vs. full dose and 2.9% (95% CI: -10.3 to 16.8) for the quarter vs. full dose. Both fractional doses were considered non-inferior to the full doses. However, in the BNT162b2 vaccine arm, the fractional dose did not quite meet the non-inferiority criteria with a difference of -4.2% (95% CI: -20.5 to 12.1). No adverse events or severe adverse events were reported as the vaccines were safe and well-tolerated.\nIn this current study, the (quarter and half) fractional doses of ChadOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines induced adequate immune response among the participants similar to the full dose (standard dose) of the corresponding vaccines at day 28. The non-inferiority of the fractional doses to the full dose of the vaccines and the similarity in the participants who had adequate immunogenic response buttresses previous data coupled with predictive models of the efficacy of fractional doses of COVID-19 vaccines\nIn a subset of participants (32% of the study population) who were noted to be seronegative at baseline for anti-S IgG, it was noteworthy that 63% achieved seroconversion after receiving fractional vaccine doses across the three vaccines. The immunogenicity in this subpopulation was higher than seroconversion rates in the study population at 21.7%. The difference in seroconversion rates observed in the two groups may be attributed to a ceiling effect where antibody titres were near their peak due to repeated infections prior to vaccination in the group seropositive at baseline. This finding is consistent with results from the UK and Israel, which described a ceiling or maximum S-RBD antibody titre level for antibody response\nIn our sub-analysis of participants with longitudinal data across three-time points, vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody and binding antibody responses were evaluated. We observed endemic level exposure to SARS CoV-2 characterized by positivity for IgG anti-N in 81% of participants at study entry and even higher levels for Omicron BA.1. This indicates extensive recent transmission of SARS CoV-2 virus before vaccination. The high degree of exposure is not surprising given that previous studies in the population observed 25% of SARS CoV-2 seroprevalence in 2020, almost 50% exposure rates in 2021\nThe incidence of the reported adverse events in the trial was 9.1% and no severe adverse event was reported. This could be explained by the significant number of individuals who had developed immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 infection even though there was no previous history of infection and none of the participants had acute COVID-19 infection at enrolment. The incidence of adverse events reported is lower relative to trials in the region\nThe common adverse events (irrespective of the vaccine arm or dose) were pain at the injection site, fever, tiredness, and body aches. These agree with reports by the World Health Organization and other previous studies in Nigeria\nThe pre-vaccination seroprevalence among the study participants at 67.6% aligns with recent studies conducted in Nigeria. Our seroprevalence is similar to that reported by Akanmu et al. (60.3%) in Lagos\nThis study was subject to limitations. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to report the safety and immunogenicity of fractional doses of primary course COVID-19 vaccines in sub-Saharan Africa, evaluating fractional doses of three approved COVID-19 vaccines used globally during the pandemic. While the trial also provides the advantage of having access to a large cohort of heterogeneous participants in a multi-site study such as this, the relatively modest sample size within individual arms and the high attrition rate during follow-up period significantly reduces the power to the generalizability of the outcome. This issue mirrors other studies that reported high attrition rates in Nigeria, Ghana and other sub-Saharan African countries on the completion of COVID-19 primary series vaccination\nThe study showed that the fractional doses of ChadOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines were immunogenic and not inferior to their corresponding standard doses in the context of a population with high rate of prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the context of this trial has shifted with improved SARS COV-2 vaccine coverage and withdrawal of the ChadOx1 from commercial use, the principles, implications and operational logic remains highly relevant for public health responses with significant implications for global immunization strategy and pandemic response frameworks\n\nSupplementary Information.", "topic": "Migraine"}

The demographics and clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in\nAt visit 2, 69 (44.8%) patients reported pain freedom at 2 h after taking lasmiditan. When classified according to daily dose, 49 (44.5%) patients who took 50 mg of lasmiditan and 20 (45.5%) who took 100 mg of lasmiditan were responders (\nThe Migraine-ACT subscores at visit 2 are shown in\nThe lasmiditan dosage was adjusted at visit 2. Among the 154 patients, 56 (36.4%) underwent dosage increase, 17 (11.0%) underwent dosage reduction, and 40 (26.0%) discontinued lasmiditan treatment. The remaining 41 (26.6%) patients maintained their initial dosage (\nLasmiditan treatment was discontinued in 40 (26.0%) patients, for reasons of tolerability (\nAmong the 17 patients with dosage reduction after visit 2, 12 patients completed the follow-up at visit 3. These 12 patients comprised 6 who were maintained on the same dosage of lasmiditan, 1 who underwent dosage increase, and 5 who discontinued the medication (\nUnivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of a lasmiditan response and adverse events, as presented in\nThis was the first real-world study of a lasmiditan response and adverse events in Korean patients with migraine. The major findings of our study were as follows: 1) the pain-free response rates after 2 h of lasmiditan intake were 44.5% and 45.5% for daily doses of 50 and 100 mg, respectively; 2) adverse events associated with lasmiditan were reported in approximately half of the patients, with dizziness being the most common; 3) lasmiditan was well tolerated by two-thirds of the patients; and 4) no independent predictors of a response to lasmiditan were identified, but female sex and a higher lasmiditan daily dose (100 mg vs. 50 mg) were independently associated with lasmiditan-related adverse events.\nWhile our patient population had an overall high disease severity in terms of chronicity and refractoriness, and took relatively low daily doses of lasmiditan (50 mg and 100 mg), the drug was effective in approximately half of the patients regardless of their demographics and headache characteristics. The rate of a 2-h pain-free response in our study was similar to that found in a Japanese study and higher than those in previous clinical trials for the same dosage (\nThe adverse event rate in this study was higher than those found in previous clinical trials (\nDespite the high rate of adverse events, lasmiditan was well tolerated by two-thirds of the patients in the present study. The adverse events were generally mild and tolerable, and the patients' perception of a favorable trade-off between the benefits (i.e., efficacy) and adverse events may explain why the dosage was not reduced in most patients. Nonetheless, intolerability was still observed in approximately one-third of the patients, with 17 (11.0%) patients requiring dosage reduction and 40 (26.0%) discontinuing lasmiditan treatment.\nWe found no independent predictors of a lasmiditan response. This is in line with previous findings that the efficacy of lasmiditan was not associated with various factors, including demographics, the characteristics of the migraine disease or migraine attacks, or a previous response to triptan.\nFemale sex and higher lasmiditan dosages were independently associated with adverse effects. A previous study found that dizziness, which is the most common adverse event of lasmiditan, was independently associated with weight, body mass index, migraine history, and lasmiditan dosage\nThis study had several strengths. We prospectively evaluated the patients using structured interviews and headache-specific variables,\nThe limitations of this study include its single-center setting and single ethnic group.\nThis study found that even low dosages of lasmiditan were effective and well tolerated for the acute treatment of migraine in a real-world setting. However, dizziness was more common than in reported clinical trials. Considering its response rate and tolerability, lasmiditan is a promising option for the acute treatment of migraine.", "topic": "Migraine"}

Historically considered distinct, these conditions are increasingly linked by trigeminal nerve-driven neurogenic inflammation. Activation of trigeminovascular afferents provokes antidromic release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP); beyond mediating migraine pain, these peptides remodel vasculature, immune infiltrates, and extracellular matrix to facilitate GBM invasion. Pre-clinical studies show CGRP and SP up-regulate matrix-metalloproteinases and integrins, while PACAP modulates cAMP–MAPK signalling, collectively promoting perivascular migration and temozolomide resistance. Epidemiological analyses report higher migraine antecedents in patients later diagnosed with brain tumours, and high-resolution MRI frequently localises GBM spread along trigeminal pathways, underscoring anatomical plausibility. Emerging therapeutics mirror these insights: aprepitant (an NK1-receptor antagonist) triggers GBM apoptosis, gepant-class CGRP blockers curb invasive phenotypes, and radiolabelled SP analogues deliver focal alpha-therapy. These discoveries facilitate more precise pathogenetic characterisation, reduce diagnostic uncertainty, and expedite translational drug development. This review synthesises current evidence on trigeminal neurogenic inflammation as a mechanistic conduit between migraine biology and GBM progression, mapping cellular circuits, molecular crosstalk, and translational interventions.

SP and CGRP trigger rapid degranulation of dural mast cells; histamine, tumour-necrosis factor-α and tryptase released thereby further sensitise afferents and recruit neutrophils and macrophages, perpetuating the cycle (\nCentral amplification follows. Persistent primary-afferent barrage phosphorylates NMDA receptors and ERK1/2 within the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis; activated microglia and astrocytes liberate brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide, sustaining long-term potentiation of nociceptive neurons and manifesting clinically as cutaneous allodynia (\nTrigeminal neurogenic inflammation represents a dynamic, multi-cellular feed-forward loop in which neuropeptide release, vascular dysfunction, immune cell mobilisation and central sensitisation operate in concert. This finely tuned yet pathologically labile circuitry not only underpins migraine pain but also generates a repertoire of cytokines, proteases and growth factors that reshape the local extracellular matrix. Many of these same mediators—CGRP-driven matrix metalloproteinase induction, SP/NK1-R–mediated mitogenic signalling and PACAP-dependent cyclic-AMP modulation—are co-opted by glioblastoma cells to infiltrate neural parenchyma. Understanding the bidirectional dialogue between trigeminal afferents and their vascular–immune partners therefore offers a conceptual bridge between episodic migraine and malignant glioma invasion.\nThe same neuropeptide circuits that ignite trigeminal neurogenic inflammation are increasingly recognised as oncogenic drivers within the glioblastoma (GBM) micro-environment. Transcriptomic and single-cell atlases show that high-grade gliomas over-express both tachykinin and calcitonin-family G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); notably, neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) and the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR, encoded by CALCRL) track with mesenchymal programmes and shortened survival, underscoring their functional relevance to tumour spread (\nSubstance P (SP) signalling exemplifies this hijacking. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that cleave basement-membrane type IV collagen, laminin and proteoglycans; the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 become fully active when surface-trimmed by the membrane-type protease MT1-MMP (MMP-14) and are opposed by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1/-2). This triad is indispensable for GBM cells to tunnel along myelinated white-matter tracts. GBM cells form an autocrine loop in which neuronal or tumour-derived SP engages NK1-R to activate ERK1/2 and PI3K–Akt, culminating in β-arrestin-1 recruitment, cyclin‐dependent kinase activation and accelerated cell-cycle transit.

In hypoxia (pO\nDownstream, these receptors converge on a protease-rich programme that sculpts the peritumoural matrix. NK1-R and CLR activation heighten transcription and surface trafficking of gelatinases (MMP-2/-9) and MT-MMPs, while concurrently up-regulating αvβ3 integrin and focal-adhesion kinase phosphorylation, which together enable traction through dense parenchyma (\nNeuropeptide signalling also remodels the immune and vascular niches that guide glioma dispersal. SP induces astrocytoma and microglial release of IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF, cytokines that polarise tumour-associated macrophages toward an M2-like, invasion-supportive phenotype and stimulate endothelial VEGF secretion. Single-cell RNA-seq atlases nevertheless identify KIT+ TPSAB1+ mast-cells in < 2% of immune cells at the invasive edge, hinting that a sparse but responsive mast-cell niche may still release histamine and VEGF in reaction to SP or CGRP.

The convergence of CGRP, substance P, PACAP and adrenomedullin signalling on matrix-remodelling, angiogenesis and immune polarisation suggests that pharmacological or radiopharmaceutical interruption of these cues could deliver a double therapeutic dividend.\nRepurposing clinically approved antagonists is the most immediate path to bedside impact.

Moreover, chronic CGRP blockade erodes vasodilatory reserve, slows dermal repair, and may blunt dendritic priming—risks that must be balanced during multimodal therapy.

Monoclonal antibodies that block CGRP, or its receptor, have been proven effective in the preventive treatment of chronic migraine (CM) in several large randomised controlled trials [\nNew daily persistent headache (NDPH) is a headache syndrome that differs from CM in that it has a sudden onset and is continuous from the time of onset, often in people without a history of headache, and lasts at least three months [\nIf there is a significant overlap in the pathophysiology of NDPH and CM, then it may be expected that CGRP monoclonal antibodies would also be effective in patients with NDPH, or at least in the group who have migraine characteristics. Patients with NDPH have not been included in previous clinical trials of CGRP monoclonal antibodies, but some patients have anecdotally responded [\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment in patients with NDPH in comparison to daily and non-daily CM.\nWe performed a prospective open-label study including consecutive patients with NDPH and CM who started treatment with CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment between January 2022 and March 2023. Patients were recruited from a single-centre secondary and tertiary headache clinic at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, UK.\nThree groups of patients were included.

In light of postmarketing evidence suggesting a risk of hypertension with erenumab [\nBaseline information captured included demographics, onset of the headache disorder, comorbidities, and previous treatments that had been trialled.\nA baseline headache diary was used to capture (over a four-week period): number of headache days, number of migraine days according to ICHD-3 criteria [\nPatients were also asked to complete the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) questionnaire of headache related disability [\nThe same headache diary and questionnaires were completed for the 4-week period leading up to a 12 week follow up appointment. At the 12 week follow up patients were also asked to estimate their overall improvement on a scale of 0% (no improvement or worse) to 100% (complete resolution of migraine).\nPatients were able to contact the clinical team with adverse events at any point in the study, and at the 12-week follow-up appointment patients were specifically asked to report any adverse effects.\nThe primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a ≥ 30% improvement in monthly moderate-to-severe headache days compared between the baseline four-week period to the four-week period preceding the 12-week follow-up date, compared between the three groups.\nPlanned secondary outcomes were improvement in headache days, migraine days, headache severity, headache load (a composite measure calculated as the monthly sum of headache VRS multiplied by headache hours for each day), HIT-6 score, EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS), patient’s estimate of improvement, and frequency of adverse events.\nMigraine days were later excluded from the analysis as it was suspected that some patients had not completed this section of the headache diary correctly, and therefore that this variable might not be reliable.\nAll consecutive patients who met eligibility criteria during the period the study were included, and a sample size calculation was not performed.

As expected, there were fewer females in the NDPH group and medication overuse was less common. Headache diary metrics were similar in the NDPH and daily-CM groups, and lower in non-daily-CM, as expected, as they had fewer headache days by definition. Disability, quality of life, anxiety, and depression scores all appeared worst in the daily-CM group and best in the non-daily CM at baseline, with the NDPH group having intermediate scores. There was a higher proportion of patients with NDPH prescribed erenumab than in both the CM groups (see Table\nA small proportion of patients (one in the NDPH group, two in the daily-CM group, and seven in the non-daily CM group) did not return the 12-week interval diaries, and six NDPH patients, eight daily-CM patients, and nine non-daily CM patients did not return the disability questionnaires.\nIn the NDPH group, 11/47 (23%) of patients had a ≥ 30% improvement in monthly moderate-to-severe headache days.

This showed similar response rates (50% and 45% improvement in moderate-to-severe headache days respectively, χ\nApproximately half of patients experienced at least one adverse effect. The most common adverse event in all three groups was constipation, affecting almost a quarter of patients overall (see Table\nAdverse events\nBack pain\nDizziness\nFlare of inflammatory arthritis\nPalpitations\nDiarrhoea\nDizziness × 2\nFacial twitching\nVivid dreams\nWeight gain × 2\nWorsening of PoTS symptoms\nAbdominal pain\nBloating\nBreathlessness\nInsomnia\nJoint pain × 3\nLow mood × 2\nMouth ulcers\nNeck stiffness\nSore throat\nTremor\nWeight gain\nThis study has shown that anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies have little effect on headache days, but improvement in moderate-to-severe headache days in approximately one in four patients and a subjective improvement of symptoms in approximately half of patients with NDPH. The probability of improvement in the primary outcome measure of moderate-to-severe headache days in NDPH was approximately half of that in daily CM and a quarter of that in non-daily CM.\nThis contrasts with their efficacy in other chronic daily headache syndromes. Anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies are proven to be effective for CM in several randomised controlled trials [\nWe also showed that these treatments are less effective in patients with CM who have a daily headache than those who have between 15–27 headache days per month. This corroborates a previous study that showed that response was 56% in daily-CM and 90% in non-daily CM [\nNo previous study has evaluated the efficacy of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment specifically for NDPH. A retrospective study including 112 adolescents with a mixed population of chronic headache disorders, who were given either erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab, included 12 patients with NDPH [\nThe results of this study showing that CGRP monoclonal antibodies are less likely to be effective in NDPH than CM, suggest that it is possible that CGRP plays less a role in the pathophysiology of primary NDPH than in CM. CGRP is a neuropeptide which is widely expressed throughout the nervous system. Its role in migraine is believed to involve release following activation of trigeminovascular fibres innervating the dura, contributing to the initiation of migraine attacks [\nThe difference in treatment response in this study contrast with a recent study evaluating onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for NDPH compared to daily and non-daily CM using similar methodology where there was no significant difference in headache diary metrics or patient reported improvement between NDPH and either of the CM groups [\nWe showed a high rate of mild adverse effects of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment, although this is comparable to the overall adverse event rate seen in trials of erenumab and galcanezumab in CM [\nDespite limited changes in headache frequency among patients with NDPH, over half reported subjective improvement following treatment with CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and one-third experienced clinically meaningful improvements in disability scores. This discrepancy between objective diary metrics and perceived benefit warrants closer scrutiny. Our findings raise the possibility that CGRP-targeted therapies may confer benefit in NDPH through mechanisms beyond simple attack reduction. Notably, approximately 30 percent of patients experienced a 30 percent or greater reduction in headache severity, suggesting that improvement in pain intensity may contribute meaningfully to perceived clinical benefit. Additionally, symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, cognitive fog, and sensory hypersensitivity, which are frequently reported in NDPH, may also respond to CGRP blockade. Unfortunately, monthly migraine days could not be included in the analysis as intended, and may have reflected this change in non-headache symptoms. Migraine days and non-headache symptoms would be helpful for any future studies to include as outcome measures.\nThe psychological impact of initiating a novel, biologically targeted therapy, particularly in patients with long-standing, treatment-refractory headache, may further influence patient-reported outcomes. The experience of receiving a modern, mechanism-based intervention can foster hope, enhance engagement, and restore a sense of control over the condition, which may in turn amplify perceptions of improvement even in the absence of major objective changes. These observations highlight the importance of including structured evaluation of non-headache symptom domains in future studies of NDPH, to better understand the nature of treatment response and to inform more comprehensive outcome measures.The inability to control for bias is a limitation of the study design and the use of propensity score was an attempt to mimic some of the characteristics of a randomised study. Randomisation avoids systematic differences between groups with respect to known or unknown baseline variables that could affect outcome. As this study was not a randomised controlled trial, there were some differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. As in the previous onabotulinumtoxinA study [\nThe absence of a control arm in this study makes it impossible to discriminate between outcomes that are the consequence of a treatment from those caused by other factors. In particular, the absence of of a placebo group limiting limits absolute conclusions about the true magnitude of treatment effect i.e. about whether there is a mild effect of CGRP monoclonal antibodies in NDPH from being made. The duration of follow up of 12 weeks was chosen due to the NICE criteria under which patients were treated which state that treatment should be stopped after 12 weeks if there is < 30% improvement in headache frequency. It is known that some patients can take > 24 weeks to respond to CGRP monoclonal antibody treatments [\nCGRP monoclonal antibody treatment appears to be less effective in NDPH than CM, particularly patients with CM who do not have a daily headache. This suggests that NDPH should not be regarded as equivalent to CM and that new treatment options are required for treatment-refractory NDPH. However, given the frequently refractory nature of NDPH, a response rate of 23% and mean patient perceived improvement of 34% may still be considered clinically significant. Given the limitations inherent to the study design, the effect of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment in NDPH should be formally evaluated in randomised controlled studies.

At the 12 week follow up patients were also asked to estimate their overall improvement on a scale of 0% (no improvement or worse) to 100% (complete resolution of migraine).\nPatients were able to contact the clinical team with adverse events at any point in the study, and at the 12-week follow-up appointment patients were specifically asked to report any adverse effects.\nThe primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a ≥ 30% improvement in monthly moderate-to-severe headache days compared between the baseline four-week period to the four-week period preceding the 12-week follow-up date, compared between the three groups.\nPlanned secondary outcomes were improvement in headache days, migraine days, headache severity, headache load (a composite measure calculated as the monthly sum of headache VRS multiplied by headache hours for each day), HIT-6 score, EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS), patient’s estimate of improvement, and frequency of adverse events.\nMigraine days were later excluded from the analysis as it was suspected that some patients had not completed this section of the headache diary correctly, and therefore that this variable might not be reliable.\nAll consecutive patients who met eligibility criteria during the period the study were included, and a sample size calculation was not performed. All data were collected prospectively within the clinical service using headache diaries and validated questionnaires.

Historically considered distinct, these conditions are increasingly linked by trigeminal nerve-driven neurogenic inflammation. Activation of trigeminovascular afferents provokes antidromic release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP); beyond mediating migraine pain, these peptides remodel vasculature, immune infiltrates, and extracellular matrix to facilitate GBM invasion. Pre-clinical studies show CGRP and SP up-regulate matrix-metalloproteinases and integrins, while PACAP modulates cAMP–MAPK signalling, collectively promoting perivascular migration and temozolomide resistance. Epidemiological analyses report higher migraine antecedents in patients later diagnosed with brain tumours, and high-resolution MRI frequently localises GBM spread along trigeminal pathways, underscoring anatomical plausibility. Emerging therapeutics mirror these insights: aprepitant (an NK1-receptor antagonist) triggers GBM apoptosis, gepant-class CGRP blockers curb invasive phenotypes, and radiolabelled SP analogues deliver focal alpha-therapy. These discoveries facilitate more precise pathogenetic characterisation, reduce diagnostic uncertainty, and expedite translational drug development. This review synthesises current evidence on trigeminal neurogenic inflammation as a mechanistic conduit between migraine biology and GBM progression, mapping cellular circuits, molecular crosstalk, and translational interventions. By integrating neurobiology, oncology, and pharmacology, we aim to delineate diagnostic blind spots, spotlight drug-repurposing opportunities, and chart a roadmap toward personalised strategies that simultaneously alleviate migraine burden and restrain glioblastoma aggressiveness.", "full_text": "Both migraine and glioma contribute substantially to global neurological disability (\nCentral to migraine pathogenesis is trigeminovascular neurogenic inflammation. Electrical or chemical activation of trigeminal nociceptors provokes a rapid antidromic release of vasoactive neuropeptides—chiefly calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)—from perivascular afferents innervating the dura and cortical vessels (\nIntriguingly, each of these neuropeptides also possesses documented oncological bio-activity within the glioma micro-environment (\nRecognising this overlap, the present review interrogates the hypothesis that trigeminal nerve-driven neurogenic inflammation constitutes a mechanistic bridge between migraine biology and GBM progression. We first dissect the cellular and molecular architecture of trigeminal neurogenic inflammation in migraine, then map how the same mediators and signalling nodes orchestrate GBM invasion. By integrating otherwise disparate literatures, we aim to illuminate novel pathophysiological cross-talk and identify therapeutic targets capable of attenuating both migraine burden and glioblastoma aggressiveness.\nAs shown in\nTrigeminovascular neurogenic inflammation as a bridge between migraine and glioblastoma invasion.\nWithin milliseconds of depolarisation, large-dense-core vesicles at the peripheral terminals fuse and discharge a stereotyped cocktail of neuropeptides (\nThe inflammatory milieu that ensues is not neuron-restricted. SP and CGRP trigger rapid degranulation of dural mast cells; histamine, tumour-necrosis factor-α and tryptase released thereby further sensitise afferents and recruit neutrophils and macrophages, perpetuating the cycle (\nCentral amplification follows. Persistent primary-afferent barrage phosphorylates NMDA receptors and ERK1/2 within the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis; activated microglia and astrocytes liberate brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide, sustaining long-term potentiation of nociceptive neurons and manifesting clinically as cutaneous allodynia (\nTrigeminal neurogenic inflammation represents a dynamic, multi-cellular feed-forward loop in which neuropeptide release, vascular dysfunction, immune cell mobilisation and central sensitisation operate in concert. This finely tuned yet pathologically labile circuitry not only underpins migraine pain but also generates a repertoire of cytokines, proteases and growth factors that reshape the local extracellular matrix. Many of these same mediators—CGRP-driven matrix metalloproteinase induction, SP/NK1-R–mediated mitogenic signalling and PACAP-dependent cyclic-AMP modulation—are co-opted by glioblastoma cells to infiltrate neural parenchyma. Understanding the bidirectional dialogue between trigeminal afferents and their vascular–immune partners therefore offers a conceptual bridge between episodic migraine and malignant glioma invasion.\nThe same neuropeptide circuits that ignite trigeminal neurogenic inflammation are increasingly recognised as oncogenic drivers within the glioblastoma (GBM) micro-environment. Transcriptomic and single-cell atlases show that high-grade gliomas over-express both tachykinin and calcitonin-family G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); notably, neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) and the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR, encoded by CALCRL) track with mesenchymal programmes and shortened survival, underscoring their functional relevance to tumour spread (\nSubstance P (SP) signalling exemplifies this hijacking. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that cleave basement-membrane type IV collagen, laminin and proteoglycans; the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 become fully active when surface-trimmed by the membrane-type protease MT1-MMP (MMP-14) and are opposed by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1/-2). This triad is indispensable for GBM cells to tunnel along myelinated white-matter tracts. GBM cells form an autocrine loop in which neuronal or tumour-derived SP engages NK1-R to activate ERK1/2 and PI3K–Akt, culminating in β-arrestin-1 recruitment, cyclin‐dependent kinase activation and accelerated cell-cycle transit. Pharmacologic or genetic blockade of NK1-R curtails SP-driven chemotaxis, while the clinically approved antagonist aprepitant suppresses lamellipodia dynamics and reduces orthotopic tumour burden\nA parallel axis operates through CGRP and its receptor family. Glioblastoma specimens and cell lines display heightened CLR/RAMP2–3 expression, a configuration better known as the adrenomedullin (ADM) receptor. ADM and CGRP ligation elevates intracellular cAMP, trans-activates JNK, and drives cyclin-D1–dependent proliferation; neutralising ADM antibodies or silencing CLR attenuate spheroid outgrowth and invasion in xenograft models (\nPituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) complete this convergence. High-affinity PAC1/VIP receptors are present on patient-derived GBM cultures; PACAP/VIP exposure modulates cAMP-EPAC-Rap1 and MAPK cascades, finely balancing proliferation and motility in a context-dependent manner. In hypoxia (pO\nDownstream, these receptors converge on a protease-rich programme that sculpts the peritumoural matrix. NK1-R and CLR activation heighten transcription and surface trafficking of gelatinases (MMP-2/-9) and MT-MMPs, while concurrently up-regulating αvβ3 integrin and focal-adhesion kinase phosphorylation, which together enable traction through dense parenchyma (\nNeuropeptide signalling also remodels the immune and vascular niches that guide glioma dispersal. SP induces astrocytoma and microglial release of IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF, cytokines that polarise tumour-associated macrophages toward an M2-like, invasion-supportive phenotype and stimulate endothelial VEGF secretion. Single-cell RNA-seq atlases nevertheless identify KIT+ TPSAB1+ mast-cells in < 2% of immune cells at the invasive edge, hinting that a sparse but responsive mast-cell niche may still release histamine and VEGF in reaction to SP or CGRP. In parallel, CGRP-family peptides relax peri-tumoural arterioles, augmenting shear stress and facilitating perivascular migration of tumour cells (\nThe epidemiological intersection between episodic migraine and malignant glioma, while subtle, is increasingly discernible. A nationwide, population-based case-control analysis of more than 22–000 adults showed that patients subsequently diagnosed with brain tumours were 2.45-times more likely to have carried a prior migraine diagnosis; the association remained significant after excluding migraines recorded within three years of tumour detection and was especially pronounced in men (odds ratio 3.04) (\nNeuro-imaging observations lend anatomical plausibility to this overlap. High-resolution MRI increasingly delineates glioblastoma growth along cisternal and cavernous segments of the trigeminal nerve as well as Meckel’s cave, underscoring the tumour’s capacity to exploit perineural corridors innervated by migraine-relevant afferents (\nAt the molecular interface, glioblastoma co-opts virtually every neuropeptide axis canonically implicated in migraine. Transcriptomic and proteomic surveys confirm over-expression of tachykinin and calcitonin-family G-protein-coupled receptors, with full-length neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R), PAC1, VPAC1/2 and CLR–RAMP isoforms enriched at the invasive margin (\nPharmacological experience from the migraine field further strengthens this bridge. Aprepitant—licensed for chemotherapy-induced emesis and explored for refractory migraine—induces apoptosis in NK1-R-positive glioma cultures and diminishes Akt phosphorylation\nTaken together, epidemiological signals, radiological patterns and convergent neuropeptide circuitry converge on a common narrative: the trigeminovascular system and its inflammatory mediators do not merely coexist with glioblastoma but actively facilitate its permeation through neural and perivascular channels.\nA growing body of translational evidence positions the trigeminal neuropeptide axis as more than an epiphenomenon of tumour-induced pain; instead, it represents a tractable vulnerability that can be co-targeted to blunt glioblastoma (GBM) infiltration while simultaneously alleviating migraine-like symptomatology. The convergence of CGRP, substance P, PACAP and adrenomedullin signalling on matrix-remodelling, angiogenesis and immune polarisation suggests that pharmacological or radiopharmaceutical interruption of these cues could deliver a double therapeutic dividend.\nRepurposing clinically approved antagonists is the most immediate path to bedside impact. Yet BBB pharmacokinetics diverge sharply: anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (~150 kDa) cross an intact barrier at < 0.1% ID, restricting action to regions of contrast enhancement, whereas the lipophilic NK1-antagonist aprepitant (MW ≈ 534 Da, logP ≈ 3.5) reaches CSF-to-plasma ratios of ~0.05—adequate for receptor occupancy but still sub-therapeutic in deeply infiltrated zones. Moreover, chronic CGRP blockade erodes vasodilatory reserve, slows dermal repair, and may blunt dendritic priming—risks that must be balanced during multimodal therapy. Aprepitant, an oral neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) blocker widely used for chemotherapy-induced nausea, induces apoptosis, suppresses lamellipodial dynamics and synergises with 5-aminolevulinic acid in patient-derived GBM cultures (\nWhere systemic small molecules may falter against the blood-brain barrier, peptide-based radiotheranostics offer focal, high-linear-energy transfer delivery. Targeted α-therapy with NK1-directed peptides has yielded encouraging but still preliminary data: the largest 225Ac-DOTA-Substance P dose-escalation study (n = 21, median 3 cycles) reported grade-3 thrombocytopenia in 1/21 patients and a median overall survival (OS) of 9.0 months from first dose, with RANO responses limited to one partial response and seven cases of stable disease. An earlier 213Bi-DOTA-Substance P trial (n = 20, cumulative activity ≤ 11.2 GBq) recorded only transient grade 1/2 toxicities and a 7.5-month median OS from therapy start, again with low objective-response rates (\nAdrenomedullin, a close CGRP family member, exemplifies the broader potential of neuropeptide blockade.

Receptor-specific PET tracers (e.g.,", "content_for_embedding": "Both migraine and glioma contribute substantially to global neurological disability (\nCentral to migraine pathogenesis is trigeminovascular neurogenic inflammation. Electrical or chemical activation of trigeminal nociceptors provokes a rapid antidromic release of vasoactive neuropeptides—chiefly calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)—from perivascular afferents innervating the dura and cortical vessels (\nIntriguingly, each of these neuropeptides also possesses documented oncological bio-activity within the glioma micro-environment (\nRecognising this overlap, the present review interrogates the hypothesis that trigeminal nerve-driven neurogenic inflammation constitutes a mechanistic bridge between migraine biology and GBM progression. We first dissect the cellular and molecular architecture of trigeminal neurogenic inflammation in migraine, then map how the same mediators and signalling nodes orchestrate GBM invasion. By integrating otherwise disparate literatures, we aim to illuminate novel pathophysiological cross-talk and identify therapeutic targets capable of attenuating both migraine burden and glioblastoma aggressiveness.\nAs shown in\nTrigeminovascular neurogenic inflammation as a bridge between migraine and glioblastoma invasion.\nWithin milliseconds of depolarisation, large-dense-core vesicles at the peripheral terminals fuse and discharge a stereotyped cocktail of neuropeptides (\nThe inflammatory milieu that ensues is not neuron-restricted. SP and CGRP trigger rapid degranulation of dural mast cells; histamine, tumour-necrosis factor-α and tryptase released thereby further sensitise afferents and recruit neutrophils and macrophages, perpetuating the cycle (\nCentral amplification follows. Persistent primary-afferent barrage phosphorylates NMDA receptors and ERK1/2 within the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis; activated microglia and astrocytes liberate brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide, sustaining long-term potentiation of nociceptive neurons and manifesting clinically as cutaneous allodynia (\nTrigeminal neurogenic inflammation represents a dynamic, multi-cellular feed-forward loop in which neuropeptide release, vascular dysfunction, immune cell mobilisation and central sensitisation operate in concert. This finely tuned yet pathologically labile circuitry not only underpins migraine pain but also generates a repertoire of cytokines, proteases and growth factors that reshape the local extracellular matrix. Many of these same mediators—CGRP-driven matrix metalloproteinase induction, SP/NK1-R–mediated mitogenic signalling and PACAP-dependent cyclic-AMP modulation—are co-opted by glioblastoma cells to infiltrate neural parenchyma. Understanding the bidirectional dialogue between trigeminal afferents and their vascular–immune partners therefore offers a conceptual bridge between episodic migraine and malignant glioma invasion.\nThe same neuropeptide circuits that ignite trigeminal neurogenic inflammation are increasingly recognised as oncogenic drivers within the glioblastoma (GBM) micro-environment. Transcriptomic and single-cell atlases show that high-grade gliomas over-express both tachykinin and calcitonin-family G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); notably, neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) and the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR, encoded by CALCRL) track with mesenchymal programmes and shortened survival, underscoring their functional relevance to tumour spread (\nSubstance P (SP) signalling exemplifies this hijacking. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that cleave basement-membrane type IV collagen, laminin and proteoglycans; the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 become fully active when surface-trimmed by the membrane-type protease MT1-MMP (MMP-14) and are opposed by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1/-2). This triad is indispensable for GBM cells to tunnel along myelinated white-matter tracts. GBM cells form an autocrine loop in which neuronal or tumour-derived SP engages NK1-R to activate ERK1/2 and PI3K–Akt, culminating in β-arrestin-1 recruitment, cyclin‐dependent kinase activation and accelerated cell-cycle transit. Pharmacologic or genetic blockade of NK1-R curtails SP-driven chemotaxis, while the clinically approved antagonist aprepitant suppresses lamellipodia dynamics and reduces orthotopic tumour burden\nA parallel axis operates through CGRP and its receptor family. Glioblastoma specimens and cell lines display heightened CLR/RAMP2–3 expression, a configuration better known as the adrenomedullin (ADM) receptor. ADM and CGRP ligation elevates intracellular cAMP, trans-activates JNK, and drives cyclin-D1–dependent proliferation; neutralising ADM antibodies or silencing CLR attenuate spheroid outgrowth and invasion in xenograft models (\nPituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) complete this convergence. High-affinity PAC1/VIP receptors are present on patient-derived GBM cultures; PACAP/VIP exposure modulates cAMP-EPAC-Rap1 and MAPK cascades, finely balancing proliferation and motility in a context-dependent manner. In hypoxia (pO\nDownstream, these receptors converge on a protease-rich programme that sculpts the peritumoural matrix. NK1-R and CLR activation heighten transcription and surface trafficking of gelatinases (MMP-2/-9) and MT-MMPs, while concurrently up-regulating αvβ3 integrin and focal-adhesion kinase phosphorylation, which together enable traction through dense parenchyma (\nNeuropeptide signalling also remodels the immune and vascular niches that guide glioma dispersal. SP induces astrocytoma and microglial release of IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF, cytokines that polarise tumour-associated macrophages toward an M2-like, invasion-supportive phenotype and stimulate endothelial VEGF secretion. Single-cell RNA-seq atlases nevertheless identify KIT+ TPSAB1+ mast-cells in < 2% of immune cells at the invasive edge, hinting that a sparse but responsive mast-cell niche may still release histamine and VEGF in reaction to SP or CGRP. In parallel, CGRP-family peptides relax peri-tumoural arterioles, augmenting shear stress and facilitating perivascular migration of tumour cells (\nThe epidemiological intersection between episodic migraine and malignant glioma, while subtle, is increasingly discernible. A nationwide, population-based case-control analysis of more than 22–000 adults showed that patients subsequently diagnosed with brain tumours were 2.45-times more likely to have carried a prior migraine diagnosis; the association remained significant after excluding migraines recorded within three years of tumour detection and was especially pronounced in men (odds ratio 3.04) (\nNeuro-imaging observations lend anatomical plausibility to this overlap. High-resolution MRI increasingly delineates glioblastoma growth along cisternal and cavernous segments of the trigeminal nerve as well as Meckel’s cave, underscoring the tumour’s capacity to exploit perineural corridors innervated by migraine-relevant afferents (\nAt the molecular interface, glioblastoma co-opts virtually every neuropeptide axis canonically implicated in migraine. Transcriptomic and proteomic surveys confirm over-expression of tachykinin and calcitonin-family G-protein-coupled receptors, with full-length neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R), PAC1, VPAC1/2 and CLR–RAMP isoforms enriched at the invasive margin (\nPharmacological experience from the migraine field further strengthens this bridge. Aprepitant—licensed for chemotherapy-induced emesis and explored for refractory migraine—induces apoptosis in NK1-R-positive glioma cultures and diminishes Akt phosphorylation\nTaken together, epidemiological signals, radiological patterns and convergent neuropeptide circuitry converge on a common narrative: the trigeminovascular system and its inflammatory mediators do not merely coexist with glioblastoma but actively facilitate its permeation through neural and perivascular channels.\nA growing body of translational evidence positions the trigeminal neuropeptide axis as more than an epiphenomenon of tumour-induced pain; instead, it represents a tractable vulnerability that can be co-targeted to blunt glioblastoma (GBM) infiltration while simultaneously alleviating migraine-like symptomatology. The convergence of CGRP, substance P, PACAP and adrenomedullin signalling on matrix-remodelling, angiogenesis and immune polarisation suggests that pharmacological or radiopharmaceutical interruption of these cues could deliver a double therapeutic dividend.\nRepurposing clinically approved antagonists is the most immediate path to bedside impact. Yet BBB pharmacokinetics diverge sharply: anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (~150 kDa) cross an intact barrier at < 0.1% ID, restricting action to regions of contrast enhancement, whereas the lipophilic NK1-antagonist aprepitant (MW ≈ 534 Da, logP ≈ 3.5) reaches CSF-to-plasma ratios of ~0.05—adequate for receptor occupancy but still sub-therapeutic in deeply infiltrated zones. Moreover, chronic CGRP blockade erodes vasodilatory reserve, slows dermal repair, and may blunt dendritic priming—risks that must be balanced during multimodal therapy. Aprepitant, an oral neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1-R) blocker widely used for chemotherapy-induced nausea, induces apoptosis, suppresses lamellipodial dynamics and synergises with 5-aminolevulinic acid in patient-derived GBM cultures (\nWhere systemic small molecules may falter against the blood-brain barrier, peptide-based radiotheranostics offer focal, high-linear-energy transfer delivery.

A log-linear association between the absolute magnitude of LDL-C exposure and ASD risk has been widely studied. High levels of LDL-C have been acknowledged as the predominant culprit. The previous research findings have demonstrated that PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) can remarkably diminish the risk of ASD. The current research has primarily focused on the relevance of PCSK9 to the cardiovascular system and lipid metabolism; however, an increasing body of evidence shows that PCSK9 is pivotal in pathogenic processes in other organ systems. Yet, PCSK9’s impact on the brain is complex and not fully clarified, although several recent studies emphasize a putative role of its impact on various neurodegenerative disorders. Among neurological disorders, not only stroke but neurogenesis, neural cell differentiation, central LDL receptor metabolism, neural cell apoptosis, neuroinflammation, alcohol use disorder (AUD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are related to PCSK9. PCSK9 expression in brain is low but greatly upregulated in neurological disorders. Therefore, PCSK9 is a promising pathway for the treatment of central nervous diseases. This review comprehensively describes evidence from the previous research on the effects of PCSK9i on the central nervous system, with a focus on the clinical potential of PCSK9i.

In the liver, PCSK9 binds to the LDL-C and LDLR complex, targeting subsequent lysosomal degradation of LDLR and increasing of plasma LDL-C in the blood vessel. Next, the accumulation and deposition of cholesterol form an atherosclerotic plaque within the artery wall that can narrow the blood vessel, activating and recruiting immune cells such as macrophages. PCSK9 directly binds to CD36 also activates the Nox2 pathway that interact with LDL-C to produce oxLDL in these active immune cells. The latter produces ROS, and oxLDL binds to both CD36 and LOX1, promoting Nox2 activation. In the brain, oxidative stress causing neuronal damage and endothelial cells death is mainly due to oxLDL-mediated excessive ROS production by activated immune cells. However, all these cascades are attenuated when the PCSK9 inhibitor is used.\nPCSK9i were discovered to be a novel kind of lipid-lowering drugs, which blocked the interaction between PCSK9 and LDLR, preventing LDLR degradation in hepatocytes [\nLinear structure, functional domains and key modifications of PCSK9. The structures of proPCSK9 contain the 3 distinct structural domains: the N-terminal domain (prodomain, amino acids 31–152), the catalytic subunit (amino acids 153–451), and the C-terminal domain (CHRD; amino acids 453–692), each playing critical roles in the regulation of PCSK9 and its intracellular traffic. The CHRD is composed of 3 tandem repeats rich in Cys and His residues (Cys/His-rich domain). The LDLR binds the catalytic domain of PCSK9, while the MHC-I complex interacts with the M2 repeat of the CHRD. On the other hand, CAP1 binds the M1 and M3 domains of the CHRD and enhances PCSK9 activity. Prior to the cleavage of the SP (residues 1–30), it was pre-proPCSK9.

We comprehensively collected and synthesized articles from previous research on the effects of PCSK9 on the central nervous system, with a focus on the clinical potential of PCSK9i to generate data that will help biomedical researchers or clinical workers develop treatments for the neurological diseases based on PCSK9i.\nThe PCSK9 gene in humans is located at chromosome 1p32, comprising 11 introns and 12 exons [\nRoles for PCSK9 and the underlying mechanisms that link PCSK9 activation and neurological diseases. Under physiological conditions, circulating PCSK9 does not cross into CNS because of the existence of BBB. In the CNS, locally produced PCSK9 may not only act on LDLR, LRP1, VLDLR, and apoER2 that are expressed by neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, but also on LRP1 and CD36 that are expressed by microglia. The PCSK9 can modulate these receptors and thereby regulate lipid homeostasis, neurogenesis, apoptosis, and inflammatory processes in the brain. However, central neurological diseases may be accumulated by known molecular pathways when dysfunction of certain receptors occurs.\nInterestingly, a variety of agents or processing and modulation can considerably determine its activation or inactivation via acting in their specific areas to achieve the aim of regulating expression levels of PCSK9. Øystein L. et al. described that the affinity of PCSK9 for the LDLR enhanced by tenfold and the degradation of the LDLR in endosomes or lysosomes of hepatocytes increased by fourfold when removing the prosegment stretch (N-terminal acidic stretch, amino acids 31–53) of PCSK9, resulting in faster endocytosis of the complex into lysosome-like compartments at the neutral pH [\nAlthough PCSK9 was first identified in 2003 in neurons of the cerebellum, originally called neural apoptosis-regulated convertase-1 (NARC-1) [\nThe reason PCSK9 named NARC-1 is it was initially discovered in an apoptotic cellular model in primary cerebellar neurons [\nThe tissue and cell lines of NARC-1 show unique patterns identical to those of other convertases [\nAs the most cholesterol-rich tissue/the tissue richest in cholesterol of the human body, the brain’s principal carrier of cholesterol is apoE [\nThe first critical explanation of the mechanism of how PCSK9 regulates LDL-C levels came from experimental reports of Maxwell and Breslow. In their study, PCSK9 overexpression in wild-type (WT) mice caused a twofold increase in plasma total cholesterol and a fivefold increase in nonhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol primarily due to the increase in LDL cholesterol, with a near absence of LDLR protein [\nFurthermore, Cohen et al. reported that subjects carried truncating Y142X or C679X heterozygote LOF mutations of PCSK9 showed about 40% reductions in LDL-C levels, confirming the fact that PCSK9 may be acting stoichiometrically on the LDLR [\nIn addition to the effect of PCSK9 on elevating blood LDL-C levels, a multitude of clinical studies clearly demonstrate that PCSK9 plays an important role in neuroinflammation. In the study of Apaijai, the association between PCSK9 inhibition and neuronal responses in a rat model of cardiac ischemic/reperfusion injury (I/R) injury was investigated for the first time. They first used confocal microscopy to observe microglia morphology, and found that cardiac I/R injury could increase astrocytic activation and only pretreatment with PCSK9i did restore the levels in astrocytic activation to the basal levels of the sham group following cardiac I/R. As we all know, amyloid plaque formation can be recognized as one phenomenon of neurodegeneration, which was assessed in these experiments as the expression of Aβ protein levels. And then, in the brains of rats with cardiac I/R injury and vehicle treatment, Aβ was significantly increased by 2.4‐fold (\nApoE has emerged as a pivotal anti-inflammatory agent in a number of neurodegenerative disorders (NDD), including AD, ischemic stroke [\nCharacterized by an impaired ability to control or stop alcohol intake, AUD is a chronic relapsing condition [\nAUD comorbid with liver disease is extremely common [\nALS is a fatal NDD that, by definition, is characterized by selective and progressive involvement of upper and lower motor neurons [\nTo the best of our knowledge, a successive accumulation of cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) is one peculiar hallmark of AD pathogenesis, which correlates with the progressive cognitive decline in AD. The clearance of cerebral Aβ exceeds its production rate in physiological conditions [\nIn the experiments of Mazura et al., FDA-approved monoclonal anti-PCSK9 antibodies were injected intraperitoneally into the AD mouse model 5xFAD to inhibit endogenous PCSK9 activity to achieve the aim of evaluating whether therapeutic targeting of peripheral PCSK9 would increase Aβ brain clearance in vivo. Finishing the above operations, they observed that treating 5 × FAD mice with low-concentrated Alirocumab for 10 weeks resulted in significantly reduced Aβ pathology compared to control-treated 5xFAD mice accompanied by unaffected general behavior [\nNTDs are severe congenital malformations affecting approximately 0.6–6 per 1000 pregnancies [\nIn clinical practice, PCSK9i are mainly used in the cardiovascular field. More recently, an involvement of PCSK9 in PD has been suggested. Jahed et al. found that LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol levels were significantly lower in PD patients [\nPCSK9i are a nonstatin preparation that can reduce LDL-C levels and lowering LDL-C levels can reduce ischemic complications. Therefore, there are some relevant reports in the field of neurology. In the studies of Oyama and colleagues, the second FDA-approved PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab reduced first acute arterial events [including acute coronary, cerebrovascular (ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or urgent cerebral revascularization), or peripheral vascular] by 19% [hazard ratio (HR): 0.81, 95% CI 0.74–0.88;\nPCSK9i are a group of drugs that controls LDL receptor expression at the plasma membrane, and PCSK9’s receptors are widely distributed in the brain, heart, immune systems, kidneys, liver, small intestine, vascular structure, and other organs. PCSK9 plays essential roles in hyperlipidemia and ASD and is also related to other diseases, including viral infections, sepsis, tumors, and immune checkpoint regulation in cancer, highlighting the potential therapeutic effects of PCSK9i in treating these diseases. This section will introduce their application in more detail.\nThe PCSK9 has a vital effect on the activation of a number of enveloped viruses [\nAlthough PCSK9 is the best known for regulating cholesterol metabolism, growing research indicates its involvement in cellular aging and the development of age-related diseases. Since cancer incidence increases with age, PCSK9 has recently emerged as a potential modulator of tumor progression and patient outcomes, warranting further investigation into its oncogenic role. As highly demanding anabolic steps, tumor growth and metastasis are especially relevant to PCSK9 [\nWe discussed the potential of PCSK9i beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, highlighting their benefits in various neurological conditions and their potential as a therapeutic target. However, there are several disadvantages or limitations in the information presented. This article mentions a wide range of neurological conditions (AD, AUD, ALS, NTDs, and PD) with lack of understanding the precise mechanisms of action. More and more clinical trials or studies are needed to draw strong conclusions to support the observed connection, which implies that current evidence may be insufficient or preliminary. The primary limitations of PCSK9 inhibitors in broader therapeutic applications include (1) incomplete understanding of their tissue-specific effects beyond hepatic cholesterol metabolism, (2) potential off-target impacts on immune cell function due to PCSK9’s pleiotropic roles, and (3) limited clinical data on long-term safety in noncardiovascular contexts. Future research should prioritize multi-omics approaches to elucidate PCSK9’s extra-hepatic mechanisms, develop targeted delivery systems to minimize systemic effects, and conduct well-designed clinical trials evaluating combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors or conventional chemotherapeutics. In addition, investigating isoform-specific modulation rather than global PCSK9 inhibition may yield more precise therapeutic strategies. In addition, we thought that findings from PCSK9i could be translated into therapeutic or preventive approaches for CNS disorders, but it does not address the challenges in translating preclinical or clinical trial results into approved therapies. The key challenges in translating preclinical PCSK9 inhibitor findings into clinical neurology therapies include (1) the blood–brain barrier (BBB) limiting CNS bioavailability of current monoclonal antibody inhibitors, (2) insufficient understanding of PCSK9’s cell-type-specific roles in neurons versus glia, (3) potential disruption of physiological cholesterol homeostasis required for synaptic plasticity, and (4) lack of validated biomarkers to assess target engagement in the human CNS. Future research should focus on developing BBB-penetrant small molecule inhibitors or nanoparticle delivery systems [\nThe FDA’s approval of PCSK9 inhibitors for indications beyond hypercholesterolemia will depend on robust clinical evidence demonstrating therapeutic efficacy, a favorable risk–benefit profile, validated biomarkers, and mechanistic insights linking PCSK9 to disease pathology. Pharmaceutical companies face challenges, such as high development costs, complex trial designs (especially for neurological disorders), market competition, and reimbursement uncertainties. In addition, optimizing drug formulations—particularly for blood–brain barrier penetration in CNS diseases—remains a key hurdle.\nPCSK9 inhibitors demonstrate superior LDL-C reduction efficacy (50–60% decrease) as compared to statins (30–50%) and ezetimibe (15–20%), with particularly strong benefits in statin–intolerant patients, while maintaining a favorable safety profile with mostly mild injection-site reactions. Unlike statins which exhibit pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects or ezetimibe’s intestinal cholesterol absorption blockade, PCSK9 inhibitors uniquely modulate LDL receptor recycling, offering potential advantages in broader applications including neuroprotection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer immunotherapy through their immunomodulatory effects on T-cells and tumor microenvironment. However, their current injectable administration and higher cost limit accessibility as compared to oral statins and ezetimibe, although emerging oral PCSK9-targeting drugs may bridge this gap in the future.\nThe most promising noncardiovascular research directions for PCSK9 inhibitors include: (1) neurodegenerative disorders, AD and PD, where modulating brain cholesterol metabolism may reduce amyloid/tau pathology and neuroinflammation; (2) oncology, particularly in enhancing immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy by optimizing T-cell function through LDLR-mediated mechanisms; (3) autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, leveraging PCSK9’s immunomodulatory effects on macrophage polarization; and (4) sepsis management, targeting PCSK9’s role in inflammatory cytokine regulation. Emerging evidence also suggests potential applications in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through hepatic lipid metabolism modulation and in diabetic complications via vascular protection mechanisms. The current research is actively exploring blood–brain barrier–penetrant formulations and combination therapies to maximize therapeutic potential across these diverse conditions.\nHowever, the cost and accessibility barriers limit widespread adoption. High pricing and prior authorization requirements restrict patient access, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Future strategies to improve affordability may include biosimilar development, value-based pricing models, and expanded insurance coverage. In addition, advancements in oral small-molecule PCSK9 inhibitors could enhance convenience and reduce costs as compared to injectable monoclonal antibodies. Looking ahead, interdisciplinary research, public–private partnerships, and innovative trial designs will be critical to fully realize the therapeutic potential of PCSK9 inhibition across diverse diseases while ensuring equitable patient access.\nIt is becoming clear that the reach of PCSK9i extends beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and its associated vascular complications. The function of PCSK9 inhibition in clinical trials has shown added benefits of AD, AUD, ALS, NTDs, and PD, leading to the design of efficacious strategies to reduce PCSK9 expression. Nevertheless, more clinical trials aimed at PCSK9 inhibition are expected to conclude effective and strong conclusions. PCSK9 inhibition is considered an attractive therapeutic target for therapy, especially in light of the fact that a large proportion of high-risk neurological diseases are associated with PCSK9. It remains to be determined whether FDA-approved PCSK9i and more findings can be translated into newly approved therapeutic approaches for targeted CNS disorders. It would be fascinating if such drugs could be designed, produced in large quantities, and become prescriptions for clinical practice application in the future. Thus, we expect more PCSK9i for the treatment to be approved by more countries’ FDA in the future. In this review, we mainly focus on introducing the roles of PCSK9 and its trials, and briefly describe the latest research progress of target drugs.

Øystein L. et al. described that the affinity of PCSK9 for the LDLR enhanced by tenfold and the degradation of the LDLR in endosomes or lysosomes of hepatocytes increased by fourfold when removing the prosegment stretch (N-terminal acidic stretch, amino acids 31–53) of PCSK9, resulting in faster endocytosis of the complex into lysosome-like compartments at the neutral pH [\nAlthough PCSK9 was first identified in 2003 in neurons of the cerebellum, originally called neural apoptosis-regulated convertase-1 (NARC-1) [\nThe reason PCSK9 named NARC-1 is it was initially discovered in an apoptotic cellular model in primary cerebellar neurons [\nThe tissue and cell lines of NARC-1 show unique patterns identical to those of other convertases [\nAs the most cholesterol-rich tissue/the tissue richest in cholesterol of the human body, the brain’s principal carrier of cholesterol is apoE [\nThe first critical explanation of the mechanism of how PCSK9 regulates LDL-C levels came from experimental reports of Maxwell and Breslow. In their study, PCSK9 overexpression in wild-type (WT) mice caused a twofold increase in plasma total cholesterol and a fivefold increase in nonhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol primarily due to the increase in LDL cholesterol, with a near absence of LDLR protein [\nFurthermore, Cohen et al. reported that subjects carried truncating Y142X or C679X heterozygote LOF mutations of PCSK9 showed about 40% reductions in LDL-C levels, confirming the fact that PCSK9 may be acting stoichiometrically on the LDLR [\nIn addition to the effect of PCSK9 on elevating blood LDL-C levels, a multitude of clinical studies clearly demonstrate that PCSK9 plays an important role in neuroinflammation. In the study of Apaijai, the association between PCSK9 inhibition and neuronal responses in a rat model of cardiac ischemic/reperfusion injury (I/R) injury was investigated for the first time. They first used confocal microscopy to observe microglia morphology, and found that cardiac I/R injury could increase astrocytic activation and only pretreatment with PCSK9i did restore the levels in astrocytic activation to the basal levels of the sham group following cardiac I/R. As we all know, amyloid plaque formation can be recognized as one phenomenon of neurodegeneration, which was assessed in these experiments as the expression of Aβ protein levels. And then, in the brains of rats with cardiac I/R injury and vehicle treatment, Aβ was significantly increased by 2.4‐fold (\nApoE has emerged as a pivotal anti-inflammatory agent in a number of neurodegenerative disorders (NDD), including AD, ischemic stroke [\nCharacterized by an impaired ability to control or stop alcohol intake, AUD is a chronic relapsing condition [\nAUD comorbid with liver disease is extremely common [\nALS is a fatal NDD that, by definition, is characterized by selective and progressive involvement of upper and lower motor neurons [\nTo the best of our knowledge, a successive accumulation of cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) is one peculiar hallmark of AD pathogenesis, which correlates with the progressive cognitive decline in AD. The clearance of cerebral Aβ exceeds its production rate in physiological conditions [\nIn the experiments of Mazura et al., FDA-approved monoclonal anti-PCSK9 antibodies were injected intraperitoneally into the AD mouse model 5xFAD to inhibit endogenous PCSK9 activity to achieve the aim of evaluating whether therapeutic targeting of peripheral PCSK9 would increase Aβ brain clearance in vivo. Finishing the above operations, they observed that treating 5 × FAD mice with low-concentrated Alirocumab for 10 weeks resulted in significantly reduced Aβ pathology compared to control-treated 5xFAD mice accompanied by unaffected general behavior [\nNTDs are severe congenital malformations affecting approximately 0.6–6 per 1000 pregnancies [\nIn clinical practice, PCSK9i are mainly used in the cardiovascular field. More recently, an involvement of PCSK9 in PD has been suggested. Jahed et al. found that LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol levels were significantly lower in PD patients [\nPCSK9i are a nonstatin preparation that can reduce LDL-C levels and lowering LDL-C levels can reduce ischemic complications. Therefore, there are some relevant reports in the field of neurology. In the studies of Oyama and colleagues, the second FDA-approved PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab reduced first acute arterial events [including acute coronary, cerebrovascular (ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or urgent cerebral revascularization), or peripheral vascular] by 19% [hazard ratio (HR): 0.81, 95% CI 0.74–0.88;\nPCSK9i are a group of drugs that controls LDL receptor expression at the plasma membrane, and PCSK9’s receptors are widely distributed in the brain, heart, immune systems, kidneys, liver, small intestine, vascular structure, and other organs. PCSK9 plays essential roles in hyperlipidemia and ASD and is also related to other diseases, including viral infections, sepsis, tumors, and immune checkpoint regulation in cancer, highlighting the potential therapeutic effects of PCSK9i in treating these diseases. This section will introduce their application in more detail.\nThe PCSK9 has a vital effect on the activation of a number of enveloped viruses [\nAlthough PCSK9 is the best known for regulating cholesterol metabolism, growing research indicates its involvement in cellular aging and the development of age-related diseases. Since cancer incidence increases with age, PCSK9 has recently emerged as a potential modulator of tumor progression and patient outcomes, warranting further investigation into its oncogenic role. As highly demanding anabolic steps, tumor growth and metastasis are especially relevant to PCSK9 [\nWe discussed the potential of PCSK9i beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, highlighting their benefits in various neurological conditions and their potential as a therapeutic target. However, there are several disadvantages or limitations in the information presented. This article mentions a wide range of neurological conditions (AD, AUD, ALS, NTDs, and PD) with lack of understanding the precise mechanisms of action. More and more clinical trials or studies are needed to draw strong conclusions to support the observed connection, which implies that current evidence may be insufficient or preliminary. The primary limitations of PCSK9 inhibitors in broader therapeutic applications include (1) incomplete understanding of their tissue-specific effects beyond hepatic cholesterol metabolism, (2) potential off-target impacts on immune cell function due to PCSK9’s pleiotropic roles, and (3) limited clinical data on long-term safety in noncardiovascular contexts. Future research should prioritize multi-omics approaches to elucidate PCSK9’s extra-hepatic mechanisms, develop targeted delivery systems to minimize systemic effects, and conduct well-designed clinical trials evaluating combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors or conventional chemotherapeutics. In addition, investigating isoform-specific modulation rather than global PCSK9 inhibition may yield more precise therapeutic strategies. In addition, we thought that findings from PCSK9i could be translated into therapeutic or preventive approaches for CNS disorders, but it does not address the challenges in translating preclinical or clinical trial results into approved therapies. The key challenges in translating preclinical PCSK9 inhibitor findings into clinical neurology therapies include (1) the blood–brain barrier (BBB) limiting CNS bioavailability of current monoclonal antibody inhibitors, (2) insufficient understanding of PCSK9’s cell-type-specific roles in neurons versus glia, (3) potential disruption of physiological cholesterol homeostasis required for synaptic plasticity, and (4) lack of validated biomarkers to assess target engagement in the human CNS. Future research should focus on developing BBB-penetrant small molecule inhibitors or nanoparticle delivery systems [\nThe FDA’s approval of PCSK9 inhibitors for indications beyond hypercholesterolemia will depend on robust clinical evidence demonstrating therapeutic efficacy, a favorable risk–benefit profile, validated biomarkers, and mechanistic insights linking PCSK9 to disease pathology. Pharmaceutical companies face challenges, such as high development costs, complex trial designs (especially for neurological disorders), market competition, and reimbursement uncertainties. In addition, optimizing drug formulations—particularly for blood–brain barrier penetration in CNS diseases—remains a key hurdle.\nPCSK9 inhibitors demonstrate superior LDL-C reduction efficacy (50–60% decrease) as compared to statins (30–50%) and ezetimibe (15–20%), with particularly strong benefits in statin–intolerant patients, while maintaining a favorable safety profile with mostly mild injection-site reactions. Unlike statins which exhibit pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects or ezetimibe’s intestinal cholesterol absorption blockade, PCSK9 inhibitors uniquely modulate LDL receptor recycling, offering potential advantages in broader applications including neuroprotection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer immunotherapy through their immunomodulatory effects on T-cells and tumor microenvironment. However, their current injectable administration and higher cost limit accessibility as compared to oral statins and ezetimibe, although emerging oral PCSK9-targeting drugs may bridge this gap in the future.\nThe most promising noncardiovascular research directions for PCSK9 inhibitors include: (1) neurodegenerative disorders, AD and PD, where modulating brain cholesterol metabolism may reduce amyloid/tau pathology and neuroinflammation; (2) oncology, particularly in enhancing immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy by optimizing T-cell function through LDLR-mediated mechanisms; (3) autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, leveraging PCSK9’s immunomodulatory effects on macrophage polarization; and (4) sepsis management, targeting PCSK9’s role in inflammatory cytokine regulation. Emerging evidence also suggests potential applications in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through hepatic lipid metabolism modulation and in diabetic complications via vascular protection mechanisms. The current research is actively exploring blood–brain barrier–penetrant formulations and combination therapies to maximize therapeutic potential across these diverse conditions.\nHowever, the cost and accessibility barriers limit widespread adoption. High pricing and prior authorization requirements restrict patient access, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Future strategies to improve affordability may include biosimilar development, value-based pricing models, and expanded insurance coverage. In addition, advancements in oral small-molecule PCSK9 inhibitors could enhance convenience and reduce costs as compared to injectable monoclonal antibodies. Looking ahead, interdisciplinary research, public–private partnerships, and innovative trial designs will be critical to fully realize the therapeutic potential of PCSK9 inhibition across diverse diseases while ensuring equitable patient access.\nIt is becoming clear that the reach of PCSK9i extends beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and its associated vascular complications. The function of PCSK9 inhibition in clinical trials has shown added benefits of AD, AUD, ALS, NTDs, and PD, leading to the design of efficacious strategies to reduce PCSK9 expression. Nevertheless, more clinical trials aimed at PCSK9 inhibition are expected to conclude effective and strong conclusions. PCSK9 inhibition is considered an attractive therapeutic target for therapy, especially in light of the fact that a large proportion of high-risk neurological diseases are associated with PCSK9. It remains to be determined whether FDA-approved PCSK9i and more findings can be translated into newly approved therapeutic approaches for targeted CNS disorders. It would be fascinating if such drugs could be designed, produced in large quantities, and become prescriptions for clinical practice application in the future. Thus, we expect more PCSK9i for the treatment to be approved by more countries’ FDA in the future. In this review, we mainly focus on introducing the roles of PCSK9 and its trials, and briefly describe the latest research progress of target drugs. We anticipate that this study will help biomedical researchers or clinical workers treat PCSK9-related CNS diseases by providing ideas for developing novel drug strategies or scientific research ideas.", "topic": "Migraine"}

Patients with NDPH have not been included in previous clinical trials of CGRP monoclonal antibodies, but some patients have anecdotally responded [\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment in patients with NDPH in comparison to daily and non-daily CM.\nWe performed a prospective open-label study including consecutive patients with NDPH and CM who started treatment with CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment between January 2022 and March 2023.

In light of postmarketing evidence suggesting a risk of hypertension with erenumab [\nBaseline information captured included demographics, onset of the headache disorder, comorbidities, and previous treatments that had been trialled.\nA baseline headache diary was used to capture (over a four-week period): number of headache days, number of migraine days according to ICHD-3 criteria [\nPatients were also asked to complete the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) questionnaire of headache related disability [\nThe same headache diary and questionnaires were completed for the 4-week period leading up to a 12 week follow up appointment. At the 12 week follow up patients were also asked to estimate their overall improvement on a scale of 0% (no improvement or worse) to 100% (complete resolution of migraine).\nPatients were able to contact the clinical team with adverse events at any point in the study, and at the 12-week follow-up appointment patients were specifically asked to report any adverse effects.\nThe primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a ≥ 30% improvement in monthly moderate-to-severe headache days compared between the baseline four-week period to the four-week period preceding the 12-week follow-up date, compared between the three groups.\nPlanned secondary outcomes were improvement in headache days, migraine days, headache severity, headache load (a composite measure calculated as the monthly sum of headache VRS multiplied by headache hours for each day), HIT-6 score, EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS), patient’s estimate of improvement, and frequency of adverse events.\nMigraine days were later excluded from the analysis as it was suspected that some patients had not completed this section of the headache diary correctly, and therefore that this variable might not be reliable.\nAll consecutive patients who met eligibility criteria during the period the study were included, and a sample size calculation was not performed. All data were collected prospectively within the clinical service using headache diaries and validated questionnaires. Missing data were not imputed.\nAnalyses were performed in R (R Studio version 4.3.3), IBM SPSS (Version 29.0), and Stata (Version 18).\nDescriptive data were summarised using mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR), depending on the distribution of data.

Propensity score matching has been proven to be effective in reducing bias in observational studies where there are a number of potential confounders and dimensionality problems arise [\nPropensity scores were estimated using generalized boosted models [\nEstimates of the differences of the outcome measures between the three groups were derived using negative binomial regression for analysis of monthly moderate-to-severe headache days and monthly headache days; linear regression for other continuous outcomes; and logistic regression for responder analysis; using the derived propensity score weights in the regression models.\nFor responder analysis, a greater than or equal to 30% response was used as the cut-off threshold to define responders for each of the outcomes based on headache diary metrics and patient estimate of improvement, and a greater than or equal to a 6-point improvement was used as the cut-off threshold for HIT-6 score.\nAll patients gave informed consent for their anonymised data to be included in the research study. Research ethics committee approval was obtained from the London – Chelsea Research Ethics Committee, reference number 21/PR/0827.\nA total of 48 patients with NDPH and 169 patients with CM (of whom 101 had a daily headache) met inclusion criteria.

As expected, there were fewer females in the NDPH group and medication overuse was less common. Headache diary metrics were similar in the NDPH and daily-CM groups, and lower in non-daily-CM, as expected, as they had fewer headache days by definition. Disability, quality of life, anxiety, and depression scores all appeared worst in the daily-CM group and best in the non-daily CM at baseline, with the NDPH group having intermediate scores. There was a higher proportion of patients with NDPH prescribed erenumab than in both the CM groups (see Table\nA small proportion of patients (one in the NDPH group, two in the daily-CM group, and seven in the non-daily CM group) did not return the 12-week interval diaries, and six NDPH patients, eight daily-CM patients, and nine non-daily CM patients did not return the disability questionnaires.\nIn the NDPH group, 11/47 (23%) of patients had a ≥ 30% improvement in monthly moderate-to-severe headache days.

This showed similar response rates (50% and 45% improvement in moderate-to-severe headache days respectively, χ\nApproximately half of patients experienced at least one adverse effect. The most common adverse event in all three groups was constipation, affecting almost a quarter of patients overall (see Table\nAdverse events\nBack pain\nDizziness\nFlare of inflammatory arthritis\nPalpitations\nDiarrhoea\nDizziness × 2\nFacial twitching\nVivid dreams\nWeight gain × 2\nWorsening of PoTS symptoms\nAbdominal pain\nBloating\nBreathlessness\nInsomnia\nJoint pain × 3\nLow mood × 2\nMouth ulcers\nNeck stiffness\nSore throat\nTremor\nWeight gain\nThis study has shown that anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies have little effect on headache days, but improvement in moderate-to-severe headache days in approximately one in four patients and a subjective improvement of symptoms in approximately half of patients with NDPH. The probability of improvement in the primary outcome measure of moderate-to-severe headache days in NDPH was approximately half of that in daily CM and a quarter of that in non-daily CM.\nThis contrasts with their efficacy in other chronic daily headache syndromes. Anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies are proven to be effective for CM in several randomised controlled trials [\nWe also showed that these treatments are less effective in patients with CM who have a daily headache than those who have between 15–27 headache days per month. This corroborates a previous study that showed that response was 56% in daily-CM and 90% in non-daily CM [\nNo previous study has evaluated the efficacy of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment specifically for NDPH. A retrospective study including 112 adolescents with a mixed population of chronic headache disorders, who were given either erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab, included 12 patients with NDPH [\nThe results of this study showing that CGRP monoclonal antibodies are less likely to be effective in NDPH than CM, suggest that it is possible that CGRP plays less a role in the pathophysiology of primary NDPH than in CM. CGRP is a neuropeptide which is widely expressed throughout the nervous system. Its role in migraine is believed to involve release following activation of trigeminovascular fibres innervating the dura, contributing to the initiation of migraine attacks [\nThe difference in treatment response in this study contrast with a recent study evaluating onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for NDPH compared to daily and non-daily CM using similar methodology where there was no significant difference in headache diary metrics or patient reported improvement between NDPH and either of the CM groups [\nWe showed a high rate of mild adverse effects of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment, although this is comparable to the overall adverse event rate seen in trials of erenumab and galcanezumab in CM [\nDespite limited changes in headache frequency among patients with NDPH, over half reported subjective improvement following treatment with CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and one-third experienced clinically meaningful improvements in disability scores. This discrepancy between objective diary metrics and perceived benefit warrants closer scrutiny. Our findings raise the possibility that CGRP-targeted therapies may confer benefit in NDPH through mechanisms beyond simple attack reduction. Notably, approximately 30 percent of patients experienced a 30 percent or greater reduction in headache severity, suggesting that improvement in pain intensity may contribute meaningfully to perceived clinical benefit. Additionally, symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, cognitive fog, and sensory hypersensitivity, which are frequently reported in NDPH, may also respond to CGRP blockade. Unfortunately, monthly migraine days could not be included in the analysis as intended, and may have reflected this change in non-headache symptoms. Migraine days and non-headache symptoms would be helpful for any future studies to include as outcome measures.\nThe psychological impact of initiating a novel, biologically targeted therapy, particularly in patients with long-standing, treatment-refractory headache, may further influence patient-reported outcomes. The experience of receiving a modern, mechanism-based intervention can foster hope, enhance engagement, and restore a sense of control over the condition, which may in turn amplify perceptions of improvement even in the absence of major objective changes. These observations highlight the importance of including structured evaluation of non-headache symptom domains in future studies of NDPH, to better understand the nature of treatment response and to inform more comprehensive outcome measures.The inability to control for bias is a limitation of the study design and the use of propensity score was an attempt to mimic some of the characteristics of a randomised study. Randomisation avoids systematic differences between groups with respect to known or unknown baseline variables that could affect outcome. As this study was not a randomised controlled trial, there were some differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. As in the previous onabotulinumtoxinA study [\nThe absence of a control arm in this study makes it impossible to discriminate between outcomes that are the consequence of a treatment from those caused by other factors. In particular, the absence of of a placebo group limiting limits absolute conclusions about the true magnitude of treatment effect i.e. about whether there is a mild effect of CGRP monoclonal antibodies in NDPH from being made. The duration of follow up of 12 weeks was chosen due to the NICE criteria under which patients were treated which state that treatment should be stopped after 12 weeks if there is < 30% improvement in headache frequency. It is known that some patients can take > 24 weeks to respond to CGRP monoclonal antibody treatments [\nCGRP monoclonal antibody treatment appears to be less effective in NDPH than CM, particularly patients with CM who do not have a daily headache. This suggests that NDPH should not be regarded as equivalent to CM and that new treatment options are required for treatment-refractory NDPH. However, given the frequently refractory nature of NDPH, a response rate of 23% and mean patient perceived improvement of 34% may still be considered clinically significant. Given the limitations inherent to the study design, the effect of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment in NDPH should be formally evaluated in randomised controlled studies.

There was a higher proportion of patients with NDPH prescribed erenumab than in both the CM groups (see Table\nA small proportion of patients (one in the NDPH group, two in the daily-CM group, and seven in the non-daily CM group) did not return the 12-week interval diaries, and six NDPH patients, eight daily-CM patients, and nine non-daily CM patients did not return the disability questionnaires.\nIn the NDPH group, 11/47 (23%) of patients had a ≥ 30% improvement in monthly moderate-to-severe headache days.

This showed similar response rates (50% and 45% improvement in moderate-to-severe headache days respectively, χ\nApproximately half of patients experienced at least one adverse effect. The most common adverse event in all three groups was constipation, affecting almost a quarter of patients overall (see Table\nAdverse events\nBack pain\nDizziness\nFlare of inflammatory arthritis\nPalpitations\nDiarrhoea\nDizziness × 2\nFacial twitching\nVivid dreams\nWeight gain × 2\nWorsening of PoTS symptoms\nAbdominal pain\nBloating\nBreathlessness\nInsomnia\nJoint pain × 3\nLow mood × 2\nMouth ulcers\nNeck stiffness\nSore throat\nTremor\nWeight gain\nThis study has shown that anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies have little effect on headache days, but improvement in moderate-to-severe headache days in approximately one in four patients and a subjective improvement of symptoms in approximately half of patients with NDPH. The probability of improvement in the primary outcome measure of moderate-to-severe headache days in NDPH was approximately half of that in daily CM and a quarter of that in non-daily CM.\nThis contrasts with their efficacy in other chronic daily headache syndromes. Anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies are proven to be effective for CM in several randomised controlled trials [\nWe also showed that these treatments are less effective in patients with CM who have a daily headache than those who have between 15–27 headache days per month. This corroborates a previous study that showed that response was 56% in daily-CM and 90% in non-daily CM [\nNo previous study has evaluated the efficacy of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment specifically for NDPH. A retrospective study including 112 adolescents with a mixed population of chronic headache disorders, who were given either erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab, included 12 patients with NDPH [\nThe results of this study showing that CGRP monoclonal antibodies are less likely to be effective in NDPH than CM, suggest that it is possible that CGRP plays less a role in the pathophysiology of primary NDPH than in CM. CGRP is a neuropeptide which is widely expressed throughout the nervous system. Its role in migraine is believed to involve release following activation of trigeminovascular fibres innervating the dura, contributing to the initiation of migraine attacks [\nThe difference in treatment response in this study contrast with a recent study evaluating onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for NDPH compared to daily and non-daily CM using similar methodology where there was no significant difference in headache diary metrics or patient reported improvement between NDPH and either of the CM groups [\nWe showed a high rate of mild adverse effects of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment, although this is comparable to the overall adverse event rate seen in trials of erenumab and galcanezumab in CM [\nDespite limited changes in headache frequency among patients with NDPH, over half reported subjective improvement following treatment with CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and one-third experienced clinically meaningful improvements in disability scores. This discrepancy between objective diary metrics and perceived benefit warrants closer scrutiny. Our findings raise the possibility that CGRP-targeted therapies may confer benefit in NDPH through mechanisms beyond simple attack reduction. Notably, approximately 30 percent of patients experienced a 30 percent or greater reduction in headache severity, suggesting that improvement in pain intensity may contribute meaningfully to perceived clinical benefit. Additionally, symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, cognitive fog, and sensory hypersensitivity, which are frequently reported in NDPH, may also respond to CGRP blockade. Unfortunately, monthly migraine days could not be included in the analysis as intended, and may have reflected this change in non-headache symptoms. Migraine days and non-headache symptoms would be helpful for any future studies to include as outcome measures.\nThe psychological impact of initiating a novel, biologically targeted therapy, particularly in patients with long-standing, treatment-refractory headache, may further influence patient-reported outcomes. The experience of receiving a modern, mechanism-based intervention can foster hope, enhance engagement, and restore a sense of control over the condition, which may in turn amplify perceptions of improvement even in the absence of major objective changes. These observations highlight the importance of including structured evaluation of non-headache symptom domains in future studies of NDPH, to better understand the nature of treatment response and to inform more comprehensive outcome measures.The inability to control for bias is a limitation of the study design and the use of propensity score was an attempt to mimic some of the characteristics of a randomised study. Randomisation avoids systematic differences between groups with respect to known or unknown baseline variables that could affect outcome. As this study was not a randomised controlled trial, there were some differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. As in the previous onabotulinumtoxinA study [\nThe absence of a control arm in this study makes it impossible to discriminate between outcomes that are the consequence of a treatment from those caused by other factors. In particular, the absence of of a placebo group limiting limits absolute conclusions about the true magnitude of treatment effect i.e. about whether there is a mild effect of CGRP monoclonal antibodies in NDPH from being made. The duration of follow up of 12 weeks was chosen due to the NICE criteria under which patients were treated which state that treatment should be stopped after 12 weeks if there is < 30% improvement in headache frequency. It is known that some patients can take > 24 weeks to respond to CGRP monoclonal antibody treatments [\nCGRP monoclonal antibody treatment appears to be less effective in NDPH than CM, particularly patients with CM who do not have a daily headache. This suggests that NDPH should not be regarded as equivalent to CM and that new treatment options are required for treatment-refractory NDPH. However, given the frequently refractory nature of NDPH, a response rate of 23% and mean patient perceived improvement of 34% may still be considered clinically significant. Given the limitations inherent to the study design, the effect of CGRP monoclonal antibody treatment in NDPH should be formally evaluated in randomised controlled studies. A greater understanding of the pathophysiological basis of NDPH and its relationship to other primary headache disorders would aid the development of new treatment approaches.", "topic": "Migraine"}

The distribution and duration of symptoms were similar between the three groups (\nIn logistic regression models (\nChronic symptoms lasted more than 12 months in 27.6% of cases and limited daily activities ‘a little’ in 63.9% (207/324) and ‘a lot’ in 11.4% (37/324) of cases (\nAdditionally, reporting at least one chronic symptom was associated with reporting poorer mental health (OR=2.49, 95% CI: 1.85 to 3.37, p<0.001), high anxiety (OR=2.09, 95% CI: 1.46 to 2.98, p<0.001), depressive mood (OR=2.83, 95% CI: 2.00 to 4.01, p<0.001) and absenteeism from work (OR=1.04, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.07, p<0.001), after adjustment for age, sex and presence of comorbidities (table 2) Moreover, 20.1% (68/338) of the staff reported that they had to miss work in the previous term, for a median of 3.5 days (IQR=2–8) (table 3).\nThis study provided prevalence estimates for chronic symptoms among school staff and identified risk factors for reporting those symptoms in a representative cohort from three large school districts totalling 186 schools in the Vancouver metropolitan area. About 1 year after the first Omicron wave in BC, a significant proportion (about one-third) of school staff reported chronic symptoms. In BC, most infections occurred relatively late compared with other areas of the world (based on both public health viral testing and serological data), and after the public vaccination campaign.\nThis study also evaluated the functional impact of chronic symptoms in affected school workers. Even though in most cases functional consequences were mild, about 10% of individuals suffered significant daily limitations, and many experienced major mental health impacts. Reporting chronic symptoms was positively associated with poor mental health, anxiety and depressive mood, which is consistent with the findings from Blanchflower\nThis study also explored risk factors for chronic symptoms. Reporting at least one chronic symptom was found to be more common among women and in individuals who had pre-existing non-COVID-19-related comorbidities. These findings could be used to identify specific risk groups in whom targeted interventions could be implemented. Notably, we did not detect a significant difference in seroprevalence between school staff and a demographic and community-matched sample from a reference population of blood donors. Consequently, it remains possible that many infections were not acquired in the occupational setting.\nThe prevalence of reporting at least one chronic symptom in this study appeared greater than other studies. For example, a UK study examining different occupational groups found that from 2020 to 2022, 11.6% of teachers reported experiencing long covid, the occupational group with the highest prevalence.\nLimitations of this study include the non-random participation of school staff, which may have resulted in selection bias and its observational nature that precludes an assessment of causality between exposures and outcomes. School staff had high vaccination uptake and were predominantly women and white; therefore, findings may not generalise to more diverse occupational groups. Recall biases and the subjective nature of symptoms may have impacted how participants responded to the questionnaires. Also, we do not know the timing of new-onset chronic symptoms relative to infection for asymptomatic COVID-19 infections; therefore, symptoms from non-COVID-19 conditions may have led to an overestimation of symptoms attributable to the virus or the pandemic. Given that SARS-CoV-2 N antibodies wane over time, prior infections may have been missed in a small proportion of study participants, although this risk was mitigated by the fact that participants reported their COVID-19 episodes regularly, including annual serology testing.\nIn a highly vaccinated sample of school staff, many individuals reported post-COVID-19 or pandemic-related chronic health symptoms. These findings have important public health implications mandating further research in this area, and the need to develop health programmes to address this significant disease burden and mitigate the long-term effects of the pandemic on school staff.", "content_for_embedding": "Robust diagnostic viral testing and serology data.\nAssessment of chronic physical and mental health symptoms of the COVID-19 pandemic among those with and without serology-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections.\nLarge school staff sample compared with secondary seroprevalence data from a period, demographic and community-matched reference group of blood donors.\nNon-random participation may have contributed to selection bias.\nRecall biases and the subjective nature of symptoms may have impacted how participants responded to questions about chronic symptoms.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on students, school workers and their families.\nChronic post-COVID-19 symptoms are defined as lasting for at least 2–3 months,\nThe objectives of this study were to (1) determine the prevalence of chronic health symptoms towards the end of the COVID-19 pandemic in a cohort of school staff in Vancouver, BC and (2) investigate the functional and mental health impact of these symptoms.

Consequently, it remains possible that many infections were not acquired in the occupational setting.\nThe prevalence of reporting at least one chronic symptom in this study appeared greater than other studies. For example, a UK study examining different occupational groups found that from 2020 to 2022, 11.6% of teachers reported experiencing long covid, the occupational group with the highest prevalence.\nLimitations of this study include the non-random participation of school staff, which may have resulted in selection bias and its observational nature that precludes an assessment of causality between exposures and outcomes. School staff had high vaccination uptake and were predominantly women and white; therefore, findings may not generalise to more diverse occupational groups. Recall biases and the subjective nature of symptoms may have impacted how participants responded to the questionnaires. Also, we do not know the timing of new-onset chronic symptoms relative to infection for asymptomatic COVID-19 infections; therefore, symptoms from non-COVID-19 conditions may have led to an overestimation of symptoms attributable to the virus or the pandemic. Given that SARS-CoV-2 N antibodies wane over time, prior infections may have been missed in a small proportion of study participants, although this risk was mitigated by the fact that participants reported their COVID-19 episodes regularly, including annual serology testing.\nIn a highly vaccinated sample of school staff, many individuals reported post-COVID-19 or pandemic-related chronic health symptoms. These findings have important public health implications mandating further research in this area, and the need to develop health programmes to address this significant disease burden and mitigate the long-term effects of the pandemic on school staff.", "topic": "Migraine"}

This toxin can potentially treat several pain disorders through botulinum toxin’s ability to inhibit the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft and its possible action on the central nervous system. This narrative review addresses the use of botulinum toxin in treating primary and secondary headaches and facial pain disorders. The highest level of evidence supporting its use varies among the headache and facial pain disorders: chronic migraine (multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies), trigeminal neuralgia (double-blind, placebo-controlled studies), post-traumatic headache (double-blind, placebo-controlled study), cluster headache (open-label clinical trials), nummular headache (open-label clinical trial), headache attributed to craniocervical dystonia (prospective cohort study), new daily persistent headache (retrospective cohort study), hemicrania continua, and SUNCT and SUNA (case reports). The site of toxin application and the doses used vary among the studies and depending on headache type.

In the PREEMPT protocol, 155 U of onabotulinum toxin A are applied to 31 fixed sites across seven head/neck muscle areas. At the investigator’s discretion, an additional 40 U could be administered into the temporalis, occipitalis, and/or trapezius muscles using a follow-the-pain strategy. The maximum total dose was 195 U at 39 sites.
