It suggests that cross-sectional brain volume measurements may be a more useful indicator of future disability than longitudinal measures of brain volume change.\nThis study also demonstrates the limited predictive value of clinical MRI metrics for short-term disability progression in a contemporary, well-treated MS cohort. It highlights the need for future research and validation of these observations.\nDisability accrual in multiple sclerosis (MS) is a significant source of personal and societal burden.\nIn prior studies, longitudinal brain imaging has almost exclusively been performed using a single scanner and a single protocol. Few have explored the predictive role of volumetric imaging using serial MRIs performed with various scan protocols and on different scanners.\nIn our prior study, we assessed volumetric data from MRIs obtained during routine clinical follow-up at several MSBase sites.\nThe goal of this study was to assess the association of several quantitative MRI metrics and their 12-month change, in predicting future MS disability. It was conducted using clinical MRIs from an MSBase cohort of patients with relapse-onset MS published previously.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of MS patients from four centres: General University Hospital (Prague, Czech Republic), Royal Melbourne Hospital (Melbourne, Australia), Box Hill Hospital (Melbourne, Australia) and Brain and Mind Centre (Sydney, Australia). Eligible patients were enrolled from 18 December 2017 to 13 October 2018. Inclusion criteria were aged ≥18 years, relapse-onset MS, known date of MS onset and consented to be part of the MSBase Registry.\nA total of 6826 clinical MRIs were transferred to icometrix and filtered by image quality. A detailed description of this process is outlined elsewhere.\nPatients with no Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were excluded. Where multiple suitable MRI pairs were available for each patient, the earliest MRI pair was selected. MRI-1 and MRI-2 refer to the first and second MRI of each pair. We further restricted the dataset to patients with MRI scans 12 (±3) months apart and ≥2 EDSS scores post MRI-2, the first ≤3 months from MRI-2, with ≥6 months between the first and last EDSS (\nPatient demographic and clinical information were obtained from the MSBase Registry including MS course, EDSS scores, relapse dates and use of disease-modifying therapy (DMT).\nBrain MRI scans were performed as part of routine clinical care between October 2007 and October 2018. Patients were scanned on any combination of scanners at their site. Inclusion criteria for brain MRIs were 3D T1-weighted (T1) sequence (maximum slice thickness of 1.6 mm) and 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence (or 2D FLAIR with maximum slice thickness of 3 mm).\nAll MRIs were processed using the icobrain software V.3.1. Scans with suitable volumetric sequences underwent a cross-sectional and longitudinal processing pipeline (icobrain cross and icobrain long) which incorporates automated±visual quality analysis.\nThe study aimed to assess whether quantitative MRI metrics and their 12-month change predict future disability progression in MS. The two primary outcomes were (1) disability progression confirmed at 6 months and (2) EDSS scores after MRI-2. For the 6-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) analysis, we used a subset of patients with ≥3 EDSS scores (1 baseline score at MRI-2 and 2 follow-up scores). CDP was defined as an increase in EDSS of 0.5 point (if baseline EDSS>5.5), 1.0 point (if baseline EDSS≤5.5) or 1.5 point (if baseline EDSS=0), sustained over ≥6 months. EDSS scores recorded within 30 days after a relapse were excluded. An EDSS change was considered any difference between baseline and subsequent EDSS score. Therefore, EDSS worsening was defined as an increase of the baseline EDSS score by ≥0.5.\nTo ensure appropriate temporal ordering for prediction, MRI-2 was defined as the baseline imaging timepoint, with the first EDSS recorded after MRI-2 used as the baseline EDSS. This approach avoided using clinical information that may have been influenced by disease activity occurring between the two MRIs.\nThe database was locked for analysis on 1 November 2018. Mean and SD or median and IQR were used to describe data distribution. PBVC and PGMC values reported were annualised. All analyses described below were prespecified.\nThe association between PBVC and CDP was evaluated with Cox proportional hazards models. The association of other MRI metrics with CDP was also explored: PGMC, FLAIR lesion volume change (LVC), whole BV, GMV, FLAIR LV and T1LV. The segmentation-based measurements (whole BV, GMV, FLAIR LV, T1LV) were assessed on the baseline MRI.\nThe association of the MRI metrics with EDSS score over time was evaluated with ordinal mixed-effect models. The models included a random intercept for patient and an interaction term for the MRI variable of interest and follow-up time (from MRI-2 to EDSS score) to evaluate the associations between MRI metrics at baseline with EDSS trajectory over time. The relationship between the primary variable of interest and the interaction is denoted in the tables by ‘slope’, which indicates the rate of EDSS change.\nAll models were adjusted for proportion of time spent on DMT between MRI-1 and MRI-2. Whole BV or GMV at MRI-1 was adjusted for as potential confounders when modelling PBVC and PGMC, respectively. Models assessing the EDSS score over time were adjusted for baseline EDSS. No corrections were made for multiple comparisons as the number of p values reported was limited and the risk of false discovery rate inflation was low.\nSix prespecified sensitivity analyses were performed for PBVC, the primary MRI metric of interest. First, we adjusted the models for sex and age at MRI-2. Second, we excluded MRI pairs with a relapse within 30 days prior to MRI-1 or MRI-2. Third, we replaced EDSS with the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) as the outcome variable. MSSS uses EDSS to rank patients relative to a normative population with the same time from MS onset.\nMinimum detectable effect sizes were estimated using 200 simulations at ⍺=0.05 and 1−β=0.80. All statistical analyses were performed in R, V.3.6.0.\nOf 974 patients with relapse-onset MS in the study cohort, 260 patients met the inclusion criteria (\nData are given as mean (±SD), median (IQR) and number (%) unless otherwise stated.\nFollow-up length from MRI-2 (baseline) to last visit with EDSS score.\nBV, whole brain volume; CDP, 6-month confirmed disability progression; CIS, clinically isolated syndrome; DMT, disease-modifying therapy; EDSS, Expanded Disability Status Scale; GMV, grey matter volume; FLAIR LV, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesion volume; LVC, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesion volume change; MRI-1, first MRI in pair; MRI-2, second MRI in pair; PBVC, annualised percentage brain volume change; PGMC, annualised percentage grey matter change; RRMS, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; SPMS, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis; T1LV, T1-hypointense lesion volume.\n244 patients had at least 3 EDSS scores during follow-up and were included in the CDP analysis.

BV, GMV, lesion volume change and the volumes of FLAIR and T1 lesions were associated with EDSS scores recorded over the median 2.8 years after the second MRI brain scan. In addition, BV at the second MRI was predictive of future EDSS trajectory. We were unable to identify an association between PBVC or PGMC recorded over 1 year with subsequent disability. We also did not find evidence for an association between any of the MRI metrics in predicting subsequent 6-month CDP.\nBrain volume change has been proposed as an important MRI metric for monitoring the course of MS and to guide decisions on treatment.\nOur study highlights the limitations of using clinical MRI metrics for prediction of clinical worsening. The absence of association between PBVC and disability progression may be partially explained by the low rate of brain atrophy seen in our cohort over a 1-year period. An annualised PBVC rate of −0.4% (using SIENA software) was shown to provide 80% specificity in discriminating the presence of pathological brain atrophy in patients with MS.\nOur cohort was characterised by low baseline EDSS and minimal EDSS change over time, likely reflecting the high proportion of patients on effective DMTs. These favourable clinical outcomes limited the capacity to detect associations between serial MRI change and disability, particularly over a relatively short time interval. Only 12% of participants reached 6-month CDP, and post-hoc power calculations indicated that the available power was moderate to low. This underscores the challenges of low signal-to-noise ratio in clinically acquired MRI scans across scanners and protocols and of using the derived metrics to predict disability progression in contemporary, well-treated MS cohorts.\nWe tested several MRI measures at baseline and longitudinally, and identified BV as the most consistent correlate of future EDSS scores and EDSS trajectory. Brain volume measurements are likely to be more robust to the inter-scanner and inter-protocol errors than registration-based methods assessing serial worsening over short time periods. This observation is consistent with a cross-sectional study using icobrain, that identified correlations of decreased BV and GMV with higher disability.\nThis study has several limitations. First, there are technical limitations due to the different scanners used among study sites, with a proportion of scan pairs completed under different scanning conditions. However, our prior study showed that the variance of PBVC is acceptable in the subgroup of MRI pairs strictly selected based on automated±manual QC processes.\nIn conclusion, while our findings do not support the use of clinically acquired MRI volumetrics for short-term prediction of confirmed disability progression, they highlight potential value in cross-sectional brain volume measures for characterising future disability state. These results should be interpreted as exploratory and hypothesis-generating, and underscore the limitations of clinical MRI data for population-level and individual-level prognostication. Further validation in larger cohorts with longer follow-up is needed to clarify the predictive value of MRI volumetrics in real-world settings.", "content_for_embedding": "Brain volume is a potential biomarker for multiple sclerosis (MS) disability, but few studies have explored the predictive value of volumetric imaging using different MRI scanners in clinical practice.\nCross-sectional metrics of brain volume were the most robust markers of future disability state and trajectory in our multi-site cohort.\nWhole brain volume predicted Expanded Disability Status Scale change more than percentage brain volume change over a short observational period.\nThis study provides insight for future volumetric analyses in real-world settings involving multiple imaging sites, MRI protocols and scanner hardware.

However, we predominantly collected responses from Switzerland, which may limit the applicability of our findings to a broader international audience.\nDifferent participants might have varying understandings of what constitutes a complementary therapy, which can affect the rating of the importance of outcomes.\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated, chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, characterised by a relapsing-remitting course or progression or both. The damage caused by multifocal areas of inflammation, demyelination and axonal and neuronal loss determines burdensome symptoms in people with MS (pwMS), such as fatigue, urinary disturbances, paresis, muscular spasms, neuropathic pain and, in time, often leads to severe disability. The two main therapeutic strategies for MS are ‘disease-modifying’ treatments, aimed at slowing the progression of disability and symptomatic treatments, targeting specific symptoms of MS.\nComplementary therapies such as yoga and acupuncture are increasingly used alongside conventional treatments for managing MS.\nDespite the availability of evidence from RCTs on the effects of complementary therapies, integrating these findings into MS care remains challenging. One major obstacle is the discrepancy between the outcomes measured in RCTs and those deemed relevant by stakeholders, particularly pwMS.\nA core outcome set (COS) is an agreed standardised list of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials of a specific clinical area.\nDeveloping a COS for trials evaluating complementary therapies in pwMS is essential for numerous reasons related to mitigating research waste.\nSurvey and consensus methods were selected for this project to capture the diverse outcomes relevant to different stakeholders in MS. This approach enables the integration of expert perspectives, ensuring the development of a widely applicable COS. Existing COSs for MS focus primarily on outcomes related to pharmacological treatments, falls or exercise.\nThis study aims to develop a COS for trials on complementary therapies in pwMS. This COS will contain the most relevant outcomes for relevant stakeholders globally, particularly pwMS.\nThis study was a five-phase participatory research project using a mixed-methods approach that combined qualitative methods (content analysis), quantitative methods (descriptive analyses) and consensus procedures (\nWe followed the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook and the COS-Standards for Development\nPatients and the public were involved in the design, conduct, reporting and dissemination plans of our research. The involvement of the key stakeholders, that is, pwMS, relatives and friends, healthcare professionals and researchers, was integral to this project from inception. First, the results of a national survey of pwMS in Switzerland informed the list of candidate outcomes for the COS survey (pending publication). Second, the draft COS survey was sent to the Swiss MS Society\nThe study management team consisted of six members (AKT, CC, CMW, JB, JLA and YY), all based at the Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine and Cochrane Satellite Complementary Medicine (University Hospital Zurich). The study management team coordinated and delivered the entire project, bringing expertise in complementary therapies (CC, CMW and YY), trials (CMW and JB), systematic reviews (AKT, CMW, JB, JLA and YY), as well as qualitative research and stakeholder engagement (CC and CMW).\nThe stakeholder advisory board was created using a purposive sampling strategy to include key stakeholders.\nThis COS for trials on complementary therapies in pwMS contains the most relevant outcomes for stakeholders. The COS proposes ‘what’ outcomes to consider but does not recommend ‘how’ or ‘when’ to measure these outcomes.\nOur COS targeted the needs and characteristics of adults (18 years or older) diagnosed with MS, irrespective of their demographic or MS characteristics, such as age, sex or MS type and disease severity.\nComplementary therapies are therapies typically outside the scope of conventional Western medicine and are used alongside conventional treatment.\nOur COS aimed to include the most relevant outcomes for all stakeholders interested in MS, including pwMS and their relatives and friends, healthcare professionals with experience in MS and researchers. These outcomes may not be exclusive to MS. Therefore, our COS admitted outcomes that might also be relevant to other health problems, given the shared nature of specific symptoms or therapeutic goals across different conditions.\nIn phase 3, we generated a list of candidate outcomes relating to complementary therapies in pwMS.\nWe performed a scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute methods\nAll outcomes identified in our searches were extracted in a Microsoft Excel form according to the COMET taxonomy of core domains, which has five areas: death, physiological/clinical, life impact, resource use and adverse events.\nThe candidate outcomes were incorporated into the online SoSci survey tool.\nThe candidate outcomes were discussed through an international, multi-stakeholder consensus process involving an international survey and two consensus meetings (one first meeting with selected participants and a second meeting with the stakeholder advisory board to generate the final COS).\nWe aimed to reach adults representing diverse stakeholders interested in MS or complementary therapies: pwMS, their relatives and friends, healthcare professionals and researchers. The experience in receiving or delivering complementary therapies was not an inclusion criterion for participation. We widely distributed the survey link to stakeholders at both national and international levels. The survey was announced through newsletters, websites and social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, X) of organisations such as the Swiss MS Society, Swiss MS Registry, Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine homepage, LinkedIn channel of the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute at University of Zurich, European MS platform, European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System, Cochrane Complementary Medicine, University Hospital Zurich Health Professionals newsletter and Deutsches Ärzteblatt (German Medical Association’s official science journal). Further, we sent personal invitations via email to individuals in our network and to authors of complementary therapies studies included in our scoping review. Participants were asked to pass on study details to their contacts. No incentives were offered to participate in the survey.\nThe multilingual, anonymous, open and voluntary online survey was delivered through SoSci Survey\nParticipants scored the importance of 39 candidate outcomes on a three-point Likert scale from one to three (one indicated that the outcome was ‘not important’, two indicated ‘important’ and three indicated ‘very important’). Participants could also select ‘unable to respond’. Through free-text entry, participants could provide comments or suggest additional outcomes. The outcomes were presented in groups in random order for each participant. Finally, participants could indicate if they wanted to participate in the online consensus meeting. If this was the case, they were redirected to another online form to collect their contact details.\nThe survey responses were anonymous. Participants’ consent was sought online prior to accessing the survey. All data were handled confidentially and in accordance with local data protection regulations under Swissethics. The survey data were anonymously stored on the SoSci Survey platform hosted on a server of the University Hospital Zurich. In the final survey section, respondents were invited to join an optional online consensus workshop, with responses stored separately. Participants provided personal details, and all data were securely collected at University Hospital Zurich, following strict privacy policies.

Four of these outcomes were already covered in the list of candidate outcomes (‘fears about the future’ was covered by anxiety, ‘taking care of your family’ by the ability to work/perform daily activities, ‘food security’ and ‘heavy metal pollution’ were covered by the safety of complementary therapies). Additionally, ‘Price of complementary therapies’ was proposed, but the study management team excluded this outcome as it is not considered as an outcome of efficacy/safety but rather a factor related to feasibility/acceptability of complementary treatments. Besides, cost and reimbursement may vary in different healthcare systems. The study management team determined that two proposed outcomes were not of the highest importance for inclusion in the COS (‘health literacy’ and ‘malnutrition’). The study management team considered that ‘female cycle, that is, menstruation, menopause’ was not a health problem or symptom. Finally, the study management team decided to include ‘prostate problems’ under the outcome ‘bladder problems’, which was rephrased to ‘bladder and prostate problems’.\nThe study management team invited 66 individuals (44 pwMS, four relatives or friends, nine healthcare professionals and nine researchers) to select one of four time slots for the consensus meeting. The time slot with the highest availability of individuals was chosen. 13 participants attended the meeting on 25 June 2024, including pwMS (n=6, 46.1%), a friend of a pwMS (n=1, 7.7%), healthcare professionals (n=3, 23.1%) and researchers (n=3, 23.1%). See their characteristics in\nBefore voting, the discussion on outcomes without consensus centred on how an outcome’s prevalence impacts its importance rating. It was noted that even if an outcome is not prevalent, its severity can still render it very important. Additionally, participants discussed that an outcome might be rated less important if it is a secondary effect of another outcome, such as sexual problems resulting from depressive mood.\nFollowing the voting on the 21 survey outcomes without previous consensus, seven outcomes were added to the ‘consensus in’ in the COS, four met the criteria for ‘consensus out’ and 10 outcomes were still classified as ‘no consensus’.\nAfter the voting, the discussion addressed outcomes that remained unclear. Participants noted that an outcome might be considered not relevant for pwMS if MS is not the primary cause of the problem. For example, sleep problems could be more closely associated with other factors, such as age, daily habits, etc, rather than specifically MS.\nThe COS arising from the consensus meeting included 20 outcomes across nine domains. For 10 additional outcomes, there was still no consensus on whether to include or exclude (\nThe six stakeholder advisory board members attended a 1-hour meeting on 4 July 2024. Revising the excluded outcomes, the decision was made to include sexual problems in the COS, despite its previous exclusion in the COS survey, due to its relevance especially for the younger generation and potential underreporting. The meeting participants confirmed the exclusion of the other outcomes previously excluded (low appetite, nausea/vomiting, hearing problems, safety of cannabis, mitigation of conventional medicine side effects, gastric problems, breathing problems and epileptic attacks).\nConcerning the 10 outcomes without previous consensus, the stakeholder advisory board proposed the inclusion of nine (depressive mood, emotional lability, sleep problems, memory problems, urinary tract infections, visual problems, speech problems, dysphagia and safety of complementary therapies). These outcomes were deemed as prevalent or had a high impact on pwMS. The Uhthoff phenomenon was not considered a priority and, thus, was excluded from the COS, as it can generally be prevented by avoiding situations that increase body temperature or can be managed by cold exposure, such as by a cool shower, cooling vests or antipyretic drugs. Ultimately, all participants in the stakeholder advisory board meeting agreed on the final COS.\nMS, multiple sclerosis.\nWe developed a COS containing 30 outcomes relevant to pwMS, relatives and friends, healthcare professionals and researchers for use in RCTs of complementary therapies for adults with MS. Our COS was developed following a five-phase participatory research project comprising a scoping review, an international COS survey and two online consensus meetings.\nDeveloping a COS for complementary therapies in pwMS was challenging. First, complementary therapies encompass a wide range of practices (ranging from mind-body interventions, physical applications, supplements and acupuncture) and potentially relevant outcomes. This diversity makes it more challenging to create standardised outcomes that are applicable across all these varied practices. Second, pwMS, healthcare professionals and researchers may have differing opinions on which outcomes are most relevant. pwMS may prioritise quality of life and symptom relief, while researchers might focus on more specific measurable outcomes. Interestingly, the ratings stratified by the stakeholder group did not identify relevant discrepancies among those groups. Third, complementary therapies may lack the robust scientific evidence that supports pharmacological treatments, leading to scepticism about the validity of a COS in this field. Nevertheless, highlighting the benefits of a COS in improving the consistency and quality of research on complementary therapies can provide broader acceptance of upcoming research results.\nThis study presents several strengths. First, adhering to recognised methods and reporting guidelines ensured a relevant and high-quality COS.\nSecond, our COS integrated perspectives aligned with real-world needs,\nThird, our COS survey was multilingual (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish), enhancing its inclusivity.\nThis study also presented limitations. First, the survey instructions provided examples of complementary therapies but did not include a comprehensive list of eligible and ineligible interventions. This shortage of detail posed challenges, including the lack of specificity and potential misinterpretations. Different respondents may have considered certain therapies but not others, potentially overlooking relevant therapies because they were unaware of them. Despite these drawbacks, our approach offered flexibility, increased participation and captured diverse perspectives, enhancing the real-world relevance of our findings. Another reason for not providing a comprehensive list is the lack of clear agreement on what constitutes complementary therapies.\nSecond, our COS survey predominantly collected responses from Switzerland, which limits the generalisability of our survey findings to a broader international context. The sample surveyed in our COS appears representative of the European MS population as 86% of the respondents were pwMS, 95% of them lived in Europe and were predominantly women (75.3%) with a mean age of 50.3 years (SD 12.2). Cultural and healthcare system differences, also in the use and definition of, and access to complementary therapies, may influence the perceived importance of the outcomes. However, our COS consensus meeting included participants from high-income or upper-middle income level countries other than Switzerland, such as the USA, Italy, Iran and Mexico.\nThird, the COS survey shows a relative under-representation of healthcare professionals (7.5%) and researchers (3%) among respondents. To reach them, we implemented targeted invitation strategies, specifically by sending personalised email invitations to authors of the studies included in our scoping review. However, this under-representation likely did not affect the perspectives used to develop the COS, as healthcare professionals and researchers were actively involved in the consensus meetings and the stakeholder advisory board, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive finalisation of the COS.\nFourth, due to the primary method of disseminating the survey being through newsletters, we could not determine the total number of individuals reached or the proportion who participated. Still, the large number of respondents (n=770) provides a large and diverse sample. Most respondents were pwMS (86%), but all stakeholder groups were represented, including healthcare professionals, researchers and relatives or friends. Participants resided in 26 countries, with the majority based in Switzerland (88%), providing national depth and some international diversity. The sample showed variation in gender (75% women, 24% men, 1% other) and age (median 51 years; IQR 41–60). Prior use of complementary therapies was reported by 79% of pwMS. This composition enhances the credibility of our findings, though limitations in geographical representativeness remain, as few participants from low-income countries contributed to the study.\nFifth, selection bias may have affected the survey responses since over one third of the individuals accessed the survey through the channels of patient or professional organisations. In particular, pwMS who are part of patient organisations may only partially represent the broader MS patient population, as they typically have higher engagement with their health and better access to information. They may also differ in socioeconomic status and healthcare access compared with non-members. While their insights are valuable, their experiences might not fully reflect the diversity of all MS patients. However, all pwMS face a chronic disease for which there is no cure, making them willing to try other therapies that offer potential improvement. As a result, the pwMS recruited for our survey may not differ significantly from others in their use of, or expectations for, complementary therapies. Besides, the online procedures used in the study, while allowing the researchers to reach a broad number of participants, may also prevent the representation of users who do not feel comfortable with technology, for various reasons. One more possible reason for selection bias may be the online nature of the survey, potentially over-representing pwMS with easier access to the Internet and digital technology. However, both these potential risks of selection bias were weighted and balanced towards cost-opportunity and feasibility issues in trying to reach a broader, highly representative population of stakeholders.\nSixth, the COS proposes ‘what’ outcomes to consider but does not recommend ‘how’ (which tools are optimal to measure each of these outcomes) and ‘when’ (at which time-point) to measure these outcomes. Further research and consensus processes are typically required to determine these aspects, which were beyond the scope of our project’s timeline.\nFinally, the large dropout between users who accessed the survey (n=1900) and those who completed outcome ratings (n=602) warrants attention. This attrition occurred primarily at the introduction page (991 users, 76.3% of all dropouts), before reaching the informed consent page. High early attrition is common in open online surveys without personal invitations, especially those widely disseminated via newsletters and social media. Many recipients may lack interest in the topic, be uncertain about eligibility or have privacy concerns. These factors have been identified as relevant to early postconsent attrition in online surveys.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first COS focusing on complementary therapies for pwMS. While it was tailored to this population and interventions, it included outcomes also relevant to other health areas, such as Parkinson’s disease, post-COVID condition or pharmacological interventions for MS.\nThis COS should be regarded as a minimum set of outcomes to be collected in RCTs evaluating the effects of complementary therapies in pwMS. We do not recommend including all these outcomes in a single study, as their relevance may vary based on the specific complementary therapy being evaluated. For instance, outcomes like muscular weakness may be more pertinent for physical therapies such as yoga or exercise programmes, while emotional well-being may be more relevant for mindfulness practices. Besides, we acknowledge that, due to the holistic and multimodal nature of many complementary therapies, these aim to improve overall well-being or affect multiple domains simultaneously—such as physical symptoms, emotional state and quality of life—making outcome selection inherently complex. Our COS addresses this challenge by offering a broad yet structured set of outcomes, allowing researchers to select those that best reflect the intervention’s scope and intended effects. This flexibility supports the pragmatic application of the COS across diverse complementary therapy modalities.\nThis COS is also applicable to other evaluative study designs, including non-randomised trials, observational studies and systematic reviews. Thus, it represents a significant advancement in improving evidence synthesis related to MS and complementary therapies.\nGiven the potential wide range of complementary therapies relevant to pwMS, we chose not to impose strict requirements for including outcomes in our COS. As a result, the COS contains a comprehensive list of outcomes.\nThis study is part of the PEMS project:\nResponders were primarily based in European high-income countries, which raises concerns about the COS’s applicability in non-European contexts and countries with lower income. To address this issue, future COS research should include participants from other geographical regions, including low- and middle-income countries, where perspectives and access to complementary therapies may vary. This could help assess whether the importance of outcomes varies by context, ensuring a broader relevance.\nOur team initially planned to use the 1–9 point scale proposed by the GRADE Working Group,\nDuring the meetings, there were discussions on how to measure potential outcomes, such as emotional lability, and whether this should influence the rating of their importance. However, it was clarified that the study’s aim was to agree on ‘what’ should be measured, rather than ‘how’ and ‘when’. Now that the COS has been established, further research is needed to reach consensus on which tools are optimal to measure each of these core outcomes and at which time-point\nMS symptoms and their progression vary greatly among individuals, complicating the creation of a COS that is neither too broad nor too specific. A stratified approach, where outcomes are tailored to different stages or types of MS, might be necessary.\nThis study developed the first COS applicable for future trials of complementary therapies for pwMS. This COS identified the relevant outcomes among pwMS, relatives and friends, healthcare professionals and researchers. We recommend that researchers designing trials of complementary therapies consider this COS, as it may help reduce the gap between research and clinical practice by promoting the consideration of outcomes relevant to key stakeholders. This COS strengthens the foundation for integrating complementary therapies into holistic MS management where appropriate. Future work is needed to assess the generalisability of the COS across diverse settings.", "content_for_embedding": "Our core outcome set (COS) for trials of complementary therapies in people with multiple sclerosis ensured the consideration of real world needs by incorporating key stakeholders.\nThe survey tool randomised the order of outcome blocks, preventing participants from assigning undue importance based on position, thus enhancing the internal validity of the results.\nOur multilingual COS survey enhanced inclusivity. However, we predominantly collected responses from Switzerland, which may limit the applicability of our findings to a broader international audience.\nDifferent participants might have varying understandings of what constitutes a complementary therapy, which can affect the rating of the importance of outcomes.\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated, chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, characterised by a relapsing-remitting course or progression or both. The damage caused by multifocal areas of inflammation, demyelination and axonal and neuronal loss determines burdensome symptoms in people with MS (pwMS), such as fatigue, urinary disturbances, paresis, muscular spasms, neuropathic pain and, in time, often leads to severe disability. The two main therapeutic strategies for MS are ‘disease-modifying’ treatments, aimed at slowing the progression of disability and symptomatic treatments, targeting specific symptoms of MS.\nComplementary therapies such as yoga and acupuncture are increasingly used alongside conventional treatments for managing MS.\nDespite the availability of evidence from RCTs on the effects of complementary therapies, integrating these findings into MS care remains challenging. One major obstacle is the discrepancy between the outcomes measured in RCTs and those deemed relevant by stakeholders, particularly pwMS.\nA core outcome set (COS) is an agreed standardised list of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials of a specific clinical area.\nDeveloping a COS for trials evaluating complementary therapies in pwMS is essential for numerous reasons related to mitigating research waste.\nSurvey and consensus methods were selected for this project to capture the diverse outcomes relevant to different stakeholders in MS. This approach enables the integration of expert perspectives, ensuring the development of a widely applicable COS. Existing COSs for MS focus primarily on outcomes related to pharmacological treatments, falls or exercise.\nThis study aims to develop a COS for trials on complementary therapies in pwMS. This COS will contain the most relevant outcomes for relevant stakeholders globally, particularly pwMS.\nThis study was a five-phase participatory research project using a mixed-methods approach that combined qualitative methods (content analysis), quantitative methods (descriptive analyses) and consensus procedures (\nWe followed the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook and the COS-Standards for Development\nPatients and the public were involved in the design, conduct, reporting and dissemination plans of our research. The involvement of the key stakeholders, that is, pwMS, relatives and friends, healthcare professionals and researchers, was integral to this project from inception. First, the results of a national survey of pwMS in Switzerland informed the list of candidate outcomes for the COS survey (pending publication). Second, the draft COS survey was sent to the Swiss MS Society\nThe study management team consisted of six members (AKT, CC, CMW, JB, JLA and YY), all based at the Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine and Cochrane Satellite Complementary Medicine (University Hospital Zurich). The study management team coordinated and delivered the entire project, bringing expertise in complementary therapies (CC, CMW and YY), trials (CMW and JB), systematic reviews (AKT, CMW, JB, JLA and YY), as well as qualitative research and stakeholder engagement (CC and CMW).\nThe stakeholder advisory board was created using a purposive sampling strategy to include key stakeholders.\nThis COS for trials on complementary therapies in pwMS contains the most relevant outcomes for stakeholders. The COS proposes ‘what’ outcomes to consider but does not recommend ‘how’ or ‘when’ to measure these outcomes.\nOur COS targeted the needs and characteristics of adults (18 years or older) diagnosed with MS, irrespective of their demographic or MS characteristics, such as age, sex or MS type and disease severity.\nComplementary therapies are therapies typically outside the scope of conventional Western medicine and are used alongside conventional treatment.\nOur COS aimed to include the most relevant outcomes for all stakeholders interested in MS, including pwMS and their relatives and friends, healthcare professionals with experience in MS and researchers. These outcomes may not be exclusive to MS. Therefore, our COS admitted outcomes that might also be relevant to other health problems, given the shared nature of specific symptoms or therapeutic goals across different conditions.\nIn phase 3, we generated a list of candidate outcomes relating to complementary therapies in pwMS.\nWe performed a scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute methods\nAll outcomes identified in our searches were extracted in a Microsoft Excel form according to the COMET taxonomy of core domains, which has five areas: death, physiological/clinical, life impact, resource use and adverse events.\nThe candidate outcomes were incorporated into the online SoSci survey tool.\nThe candidate outcomes were discussed through an international, multi-stakeholder consensus process involving an international survey and two consensus meetings (one first meeting with selected participants and a second meeting with the stakeholder advisory board to generate the final COS).\nWe aimed to reach adults representing diverse stakeholders interested in MS or complementary therapies: pwMS, their relatives and friends, healthcare professionals and researchers. The experience in receiving or delivering complementary therapies was not an inclusion criterion for participation. We widely distributed the survey link to stakeholders at both national and international levels. The survey was announced through newsletters, websites and social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, X) of organisations such as the Swiss MS Society, Swiss MS Registry, Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine homepage, LinkedIn channel of the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute at University of Zurich, European MS platform, European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System, Cochrane Complementary Medicine, University Hospital Zurich Health Professionals newsletter and Deutsches Ärzteblatt (German Medical Association’s official science journal). Further, we sent personal invitations via email to individuals in our network and to authors of complementary therapies studies included in our scoping review. Participants were asked to pass on study details to their contacts. No incentives were offered to participate in the survey.\nThe multilingual, anonymous, open and voluntary online survey was delivered through SoSci Survey\nParticipants scored the importance of 39 candidate outcomes on a three-point Likert scale from one to three (one indicated that the outcome was ‘not important’, two indicated ‘important’ and three indicated ‘very important’). Participants could also select ‘unable to respond’. Through free-text entry, participants could provide comments or suggest additional outcomes. The outcomes were presented in groups in random order for each participant. Finally, participants could indicate if they wanted to participate in the online consensus meeting. If this was the case, they were redirected to another online form to collect their contact details.\nThe survey responses were anonymous. Participants’ consent was sought online prior to accessing the survey. All data were handled confidentially and in accordance with local data protection regulations under Swissethics. The survey data were anonymously stored on the SoSci Survey platform hosted on a server of the University Hospital Zurich. In the final survey section, respondents were invited to join an optional online consensus workshop, with responses stored separately. Participants provided personal details, and all data were securely collected at University Hospital Zurich, following strict privacy policies.

Cultural and healthcare system differences, also in the use and definition of, and access to complementary therapies, may influence the perceived importance of the outcomes. However, our COS consensus meeting included participants from high-income or upper-middle income level countries other than Switzerland, such as the USA, Italy, Iran and Mexico.\nThird, the COS survey shows a relative under-representation of healthcare professionals (7.5%) and researchers (3%) among respondents. To reach them, we implemented targeted invitation strategies, specifically by sending personalised email invitations to authors of the studies included in our scoping review. However, this under-representation likely did not affect the perspectives used to develop the COS, as healthcare professionals and researchers were actively involved in the consensus meetings and the stakeholder advisory board, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive finalisation of the COS.\nFourth, due to the primary method of disseminating the survey being through newsletters, we could not determine the total number of individuals reached or the proportion who participated. Still, the large number of respondents (n=770) provides a large and diverse sample. Most respondents were pwMS (86%), but all stakeholder groups were represented, including healthcare professionals, researchers and relatives or friends. Participants resided in 26 countries, with the majority based in Switzerland (88%), providing national depth and some international diversity. The sample showed variation in gender (75% women, 24% men, 1% other) and age (median 51 years; IQR 41–60). Prior use of complementary therapies was reported by 79% of pwMS. This composition enhances the credibility of our findings, though limitations in geographical representativeness remain, as few participants from low-income countries contributed to the study.\nFifth, selection bias may have affected the survey responses since over one third of the individuals accessed the survey through the channels of patient or professional organisations. In particular, pwMS who are part of patient organisations may only partially represent the broader MS patient population, as they typically have higher engagement with their health and better access to information. They may also differ in socioeconomic status and healthcare access compared with non-members. While their insights are valuable, their experiences might not fully reflect the diversity of all MS patients. However, all pwMS face a chronic disease for which there is no cure, making them willing to try other therapies that offer potential improvement. As a result, the pwMS recruited for our survey may not differ significantly from others in their use of, or expectations for, complementary therapies. Besides, the online procedures used in the study, while allowing the researchers to reach a broad number of participants, may also prevent the representation of users who do not feel comfortable with technology, for various reasons. One more possible reason for selection bias may be the online nature of the survey, potentially over-representing pwMS with easier access to the Internet and digital technology. However, both these potential risks of selection bias were weighted and balanced towards cost-opportunity and feasibility issues in trying to reach a broader, highly representative population of stakeholders.\nSixth, the COS proposes ‘what’ outcomes to consider but does not recommend ‘how’ (which tools are optimal to measure each of these outcomes) and ‘when’ (at which time-point) to measure these outcomes. Further research and consensus processes are typically required to determine these aspects, which were beyond the scope of our project’s timeline.\nFinally, the large dropout between users who accessed the survey (n=1900) and those who completed outcome ratings (n=602) warrants attention. This attrition occurred primarily at the introduction page (991 users, 76.3% of all dropouts), before reaching the informed consent page. High early attrition is common in open online surveys without personal invitations, especially those widely disseminated via newsletters and social media. Many recipients may lack interest in the topic, be uncertain about eligibility or have privacy concerns. These factors have been identified as relevant to early postconsent attrition in online surveys.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first COS focusing on complementary therapies for pwMS. While it was tailored to this population and interventions, it included outcomes also relevant to other health areas, such as Parkinson’s disease, post-COVID condition or pharmacological interventions for MS.\nThis COS should be regarded as a minimum set of outcomes to be collected in RCTs evaluating the effects of complementary therapies in pwMS. We do not recommend including all these outcomes in a single study, as their relevance may vary based on the specific complementary therapy being evaluated. For instance, outcomes like muscular weakness may be more pertinent for physical therapies such as yoga or exercise programmes, while emotional well-being may be more relevant for mindfulness practices. Besides, we acknowledge that, due to the holistic and multimodal nature of many complementary therapies, these aim to improve overall well-being or affect multiple domains simultaneously—such as physical symptoms, emotional state and quality of life—making outcome selection inherently complex. Our COS addresses this challenge by offering a broad yet structured set of outcomes, allowing researchers to select those that best reflect the intervention’s scope and intended effects. This flexibility supports the pragmatic application of the COS across diverse complementary therapy modalities.\nThis COS is also applicable to other evaluative study designs, including non-randomised trials, observational studies and systematic reviews. Thus, it represents a significant advancement in improving evidence synthesis related to MS and complementary therapies.\nGiven the potential wide range of complementary therapies relevant to pwMS, we chose not to impose strict requirements for including outcomes in our COS. As a result, the COS contains a comprehensive list of outcomes.\nThis study is part of the PEMS project:\nResponders were primarily based in European high-income countries, which raises concerns about the COS’s applicability in non-European contexts and countries with lower income. To address this issue, future COS research should include participants from other geographical regions, including low- and middle-income countries, where perspectives and access to complementary therapies may vary. This could help assess whether the importance of outcomes varies by context, ensuring a broader relevance.\nOur team initially planned to use the 1–9 point scale proposed by the GRADE Working Group,\nDuring the meetings, there were discussions on how to measure potential outcomes, such as emotional lability, and whether this should influence the rating of their importance. However, it was clarified that the study’s aim was to agree on ‘what’ should be measured, rather than ‘how’ and ‘when’. Now that the COS has been established, further research is needed to reach consensus on which tools are optimal to measure each of these core outcomes and at which time-point\nMS symptoms and their progression vary greatly among individuals, complicating the creation of a COS that is neither too broad nor too specific. A stratified approach, where outcomes are tailored to different stages or types of MS, might be necessary.\nThis study developed the first COS applicable for future trials of complementary therapies for pwMS. This COS identified the relevant outcomes among pwMS, relatives and friends, healthcare professionals and researchers. We recommend that researchers designing trials of complementary therapies consider this COS, as it may help reduce the gap between research and clinical practice by promoting the consideration of outcomes relevant to key stakeholders. This COS strengthens the foundation for integrating complementary therapies into holistic MS management where appropriate. Future work is needed to assess the generalisability of the COS across diverse settings.", "topic": "Sclerosis"}

Moreover, robust data indicate that early disease activity strongly correlates with future disability.

This large sham-controlled RCT evaluated tDCS paired with aCT as an at-home intervention targeting fatigue in MS\nThe high fidelity to the intervention, with 92% of participants completing more than 25 tDCS + aCT sessions, underscores its feasibility and acceptability as a home-based approach for MS patients. This is noteworthy given the challenges of remote supervision and adherence to such interventions. As we previously demonstrated in a survey study, this telerehabilitation approach has the potential to be implemented at scale, offering opportunities to reduce costs and time commitment (e.g., minimizing commuting time)\nThis study reinforces the efficacy of remotely supervised tDCS with web-based aCT, which enhances accessibility, scheduling flexibility, and adaptive difficulty, improving adherence and engagement.\nOverall, these findings are consistent with the large and growing literature supporting tDCS paired with training for recovery of function and prevention of cognitive decline,\nThe findings suggest that cognitive benefits in the active tDCS group primarily reflect stabilization rather than recovery. While tDCS + aCT has been associated with neuroprotection and cognitive maintenance, further longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these effects persist over time and contribute to long-term cognitive prevention. While MS-related cognitive decline is typically gradual, certain subgroups, particularly those with higher EDSS scores, may be more vulnerable to decline over shorter timeframes. The decline observed in the sham group highlights this possibility, reinforcing the need for longer-term follow-up studies to assess the durability of these effects. The sham group experienced a decline, deviating from the typical stability in MS over months or years,\nAs with all sham-controlled trials, placebo effects remain a consideration. However, the lack of cognitive improvements in the sham group suggests that expectancy effects were unlikely to account for the observed benefits in the active condition. Future studies should continue refining sham control methods to further rule out subtle placebo influences.\nThe synergistic effects of tDCS combined with BrainHQ have been reported in MS,\nParticipants with higher neurological disability, as indicated by EDSS scores, experienced greater cognitive benefits. This suggests that individuals with more severe impairment may derive more significant advantages, highlighting the need for dosing optimization and predictive markers for response. However, EDSS primarily measures physical disability\nTo evaluate whether baseline cognitive impairment influenced intervention response, we tested multiple SDMT cutoffs and found no evidence that cognitive function moderated outcomes. Instead, cognitive benefits were primarily observed in those with higher neurological disability (EDSS ≥ 3.5), regardless of baseline cognitive status. These findings suggest that intervention effects may be more dependent on the level of overall neurological impairment rather than cognitive status alone. Following current convention in MS clinical trials, we relied on the EDSS as a standardized measure at the level of global disability classification. While EDSS is widely used and provides a standardized assessment of physical disability,\nIn this trial, fatigue did not influence cognitive outcomes, as detailed in our previously published study.\nThere are limitations to this study. Fatigue was the primary outcome, and participants were not enrolled based on cognitive impairment but were screened to exclude those with severe impairment. This exclusion criterion limits generalizability to individuals with moderate or less cognitive impairment. However, the sample characteristics align with prior BrainHQ trials,\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates the efficacy of tDCS paired with aCT (BrainHQ) as an at-home intervention to improve cognitive function in MS patients, particularly those with high neurological disability. Active tDCS significantly outperformed sham in cognitive outcomes, with greater benefits observed in patients with higher baseline neurological disability. The findings suggest cognitive benefits align more with preventing decline than recovery.

To further investigate significant interactions, post hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted using the Sidak correction to control for multiple comparisons, ensuring a more accurate assessment of group differences.\nTwo-sample\nParticipants were recruited between April 2019 and February 2021 (\nAs the intervention was conducted remotely, enrollment for the trial continued throughout the COVID-19 pandemic until its conclusion. The protocol was adjusted to deliver study equipment to participants’ homes, and baseline assessments (\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of randomized participants (\nEDSS: Extended Disability Status Scale; PPMS: primary progressive MS; RRMS: relapsing-remitting MS; SPMS: secondary progressive MS.\nThere were no serious AEs, and the intervention was well tolerated.

This large sham-controlled RCT evaluated tDCS paired with aCT as an at-home intervention targeting fatigue in MS\nThe high fidelity to the intervention, with 92% of participants completing more than 25 tDCS + aCT sessions, underscores its feasibility and acceptability as a home-based approach for MS patients. This is noteworthy given the challenges of remote supervision and adherence to such interventions. As we previously demonstrated in a survey study, this telerehabilitation approach has the potential to be implemented at scale, offering opportunities to reduce costs and time commitment (e.g., minimizing commuting time)\nThis study reinforces the efficacy of remotely supervised tDCS with web-based aCT, which enhances accessibility, scheduling flexibility, and adaptive difficulty, improving adherence and engagement.\nOverall, these findings are consistent with the large and growing literature supporting tDCS paired with training for recovery of function and prevention of cognitive decline,\nThe findings suggest that cognitive benefits in the active tDCS group primarily reflect stabilization rather than recovery. While tDCS + aCT has been associated with neuroprotection and cognitive maintenance, further longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these effects persist over time and contribute to long-term cognitive prevention. While MS-related cognitive decline is typically gradual, certain subgroups, particularly those with higher EDSS scores, may be more vulnerable to decline over shorter timeframes. The decline observed in the sham group highlights this possibility, reinforcing the need for longer-term follow-up studies to assess the durability of these effects. The sham group experienced a decline, deviating from the typical stability in MS over months or years,\nAs with all sham-controlled trials, placebo effects remain a consideration. However, the lack of cognitive improvements in the sham group suggests that expectancy effects were unlikely to account for the observed benefits in the active condition. Future studies should continue refining sham control methods to further rule out subtle placebo influences.\nThe synergistic effects of tDCS combined with BrainHQ have been reported in MS,\nParticipants with higher neurological disability, as indicated by EDSS scores, experienced greater cognitive benefits. This suggests that individuals with more severe impairment may derive more significant advantages, highlighting the need for dosing optimization and predictive markers for response. However, EDSS primarily measures physical disability\nTo evaluate whether baseline cognitive impairment influenced intervention response, we tested multiple SDMT cutoffs and found no evidence that cognitive function moderated outcomes. Instead, cognitive benefits were primarily observed in those with higher neurological disability (EDSS ≥ 3.5), regardless of baseline cognitive status. These findings suggest that intervention effects may be more dependent on the level of overall neurological impairment rather than cognitive status alone. Following current convention in MS clinical trials, we relied on the EDSS as a standardized measure at the level of global disability classification. While EDSS is widely used and provides a standardized assessment of physical disability,\nIn this trial, fatigue did not influence cognitive outcomes, as detailed in our previously published study.\nThere are limitations to this study. Fatigue was the primary outcome, and participants were not enrolled based on cognitive impairment but were screened to exclude those with severe impairment. This exclusion criterion limits generalizability to individuals with moderate or less cognitive impairment. However, the sample characteristics align with prior BrainHQ trials,\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates the efficacy of tDCS paired with aCT (BrainHQ) as an at-home intervention to improve cognitive function in MS patients, particularly those with high neurological disability. Active tDCS significantly outperformed sham in cognitive outcomes, with greater benefits observed in patients with higher baseline neurological disability. The findings suggest cognitive benefits align more with preventing decline than recovery. Future research should investigate optimal intervention duration, frequency, and long-term cognitive effects in this population.", "topic": "Sclerosis"}

Attention mechanisms have been widely applied across various domains to improve the performance of deep learning models. For instance, an attention-guided CNN framework has been proposed to classify breast cancer histopathology images, using a supervised attention method to focus on regions of interest\nAlthough there have been substantial advances in plant disease detection and classification, there is still a noticeable gap in the early-stage disease detection and severity classification of BLB disease in rice. BLB usually begins in localized leaf areas, so early detection is crucial for timely intervention and prevention. However, training models on such regional variances is challenging due to a lack of labeled datasets monitoring BLB advancement. Most present models concentrate on disease diagnosis at advanced stages. The primary aim of this research is to develop a model capable of detecting bacterial blight disease in rice in its early stages and categorizing its severity, facilitating timely prevention using a combination of segmentation and deep learning techniques. This approach seeks to address the current limitations and improve the accuracy and efficiency of BLB pathogenesis monitoring.\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 1 elaborates on the dataset collection process, Section 2 outlines the experimental design of RCAMNet, and Section 3 discusses the experimental results.

In addition, the dataset includes images generated through artificial inoculation to ensure controlled and standardized representations of disease progression with uniform lighting and clean backgrounds. To induce BLB under controlled conditions, a virulent bacterial strain was selected and rice plants were cultivated in a regulated environment.

The inference time was measured on a CUDA-enabled NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU within a Google Colab Pro environment. The average time taken by each stage is summarized in Table\nStage-wise average inference time of RCAMNet on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU.\nThe results of this study demonstrate the potential of RCAMNet to fill a critical gap in rice BLB severity detection. Currently, there is no established system for the reliable identification of BLB stage, despite the rapid progression of the disease and the severe impact on rice yield. RCAMNet addresses this need by enabling stage-wise severity assessment, which is valuable for timely interventions by farmers and agricultural officers. Additionally, the dataset curated in this work is a significant contribution, as no publicly available dataset previously existed for BLB progression stages. The model also performs robustly under real-world conditions such as occlusion, low light, and overlapping symptoms, highlighting its practicality in diverse agricultural environments. Compared to traditional CNN-based approaches, RCAMNet shows improved accuracy and interpretability.\nDespite these strengths, the proposed approach has some limitations. A major constraint is deployment compatibility: the segmentation stage relies on Detectron2, which is currently not suitable for mobile devices. Consequently, users must upload images to a server for segmentation, which introduces latency and connectivity dependence. This limitation could be addressed in future work by developing a lightweight, mobile-compatible multiclass segmentation model. Furthermore, the data set used in this study was collected exclusively from Kerala, India, which may limit the applicability to other regions with different environmental conditions and disease presentations.\nFuture research will focus on developing a compact, mobile-friendly version of RCAMNet with reduced inference time and on-device processing.

Globally, the incidence of MS is higher in the European region, with a significantly higher number of female patients, and the age of onset is usually centered between 20 and 40 years [\nGlial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), a protein synthesized by astrocytes, has been identified as a sensitive biomarker of CNS injury and has shown significant diagnostic and prognostic value in a variety of neuroimmune diseases [\nIn this study, a comprehensive review of the research literature related to GFAP in the prognosis of neuroimmune diseases was conducted by computerized searches of the following multiple databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, Wanfang, PubMed, Wiley Online Library, and Web of Science. The time frame of the search was from inception to December 1, 2024 to ensure that the latest research results in the related fields were covered. In order to ensure systematic and comprehensive literature retrieval, this study will implement manual secondary search methods—including reviewing high-quality syntheses, extracting relevant content, and scanning reference lists—thereby bridging potential gaps in computerized searches and guaranteeing broad coverage and representativeness of included literature, which provides solid data support and theoretical foundation for subsequent reviews. Search terms include: GFAP、Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein、Multiple Sclerosis、MS、prognosis、Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders、NMOSD; Using Pubmed as an example, the search formula is as follows: ((((GFAP) OR (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)) AND (Multiple Sclerosis)) OR (MS)) AND (prognosis); ((((GFAP) OR (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)) AND (Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders)) OR (NMOSD)) AND (prognosis). This systematic review has been performed and written in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n\nInclusion criteria: (1) The study subjects are MS or NMOSD patients. (2) The study contains GFAP related test data, and there are indicators about GFAP and disease diagnosis and prognosis. (3) The type of study is an original study (including prospective study, retrospective study, etc.), such as cohort study, case-control study, etc. (4) Provide clear data.\nExclusion criteria: (1) Repeatedly published literature. (2) Literature types without original data such as reviews, commentaries, conference abstracts, and case reports.

(4) Literature with incomplete data or key data that could not be extracted for Meta-analysis.\n(1) Comparison of NfL and GFAP serum levels in MS and NMOSD patients with healthy controls; (2) Survival analysis of MS and NMOSD patients.\nThe endpoints of survival analysis are disease recurrence or death. Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from disease diagnosis to death. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) refers to the duration from the initiation of treatment to the occurrence of disease recurrence.\nDuring the literature analysis, the researchers independently extracted key information from the studies, including fundamental data such as the study period, year of publication, first author, and affiliated research institution. Simultaneously, they analyzed and interpreted the research methods, experimental design, study subjects, statistical indicators of the results, and their clinical significance. In cases of differing interpretations or evaluations, an independent third-party expert was invited for peer review, with consensus reached through thorough discussion and verification. For instances where data were missing, descriptions were unclear, or detailed information was unavailable, the researchers attempted to contact the corresponding author of the study to obtain the most recent and accurate supplementary materials. If supplemental information could not be obtained within a reasonable timeframe or remained ambiguous, the study was excluded to ensure the scientific rigor of the literature review and the reliability of the data.\nThe quality assessment of the literature was conducted independently by two researchers with professional expertise in the relevant field to ensure a high level of objectivity and accuracy in the evaluation process. All pertinent information, including baseline data and outcome measures, was systematically recorded and organized in an Excel spreadsheet to ensure data integrity and traceability. The researchers performed a comprehensive and standardized quality assessment of the included literature, rigorously evaluating each intervention using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool in RevMan 5.4.1, and analyzed their potential risk of bias. The risk of bias was assessed according to established methodological criteria. Random sequence generation was classified as low risk if computer-generated randomization or random number tables were employed, and high/unclear risk otherwise. Allocation concealment was deemed low risk only when robust methods such as sealed opaque envelopes were implemented, otherwise categorized as high/unclear risk. For blinding procedures, low risk required blinding of both investigators and participants; absence of blinding resulted in high/unclear risk classification. Attrition bias was rated low risk when attrition rates remained below 10% with explicit documentation of withdrawal reasons, and high risk if these conditions were unmet. Finally, selective reporting was judged low risk exclusively for studies with prospectively registered protocols and complete outcome reporting; all other cases were designated high risk. In cases of disagreement during the assessment, a third qualified expert was consulted for deliberation and resolution.\nMethodological quality assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), evaluating three domains—selection (4 points), comparability (2 points), and outcome/exposure assessment (3 points)—with a maximum total score of 9 points; specific criteria included cohort representativeness, control group sources, exposure/outcome ascertainment methods, control for confounding factors, and follow-up adequacy, each scored against predefined standards where studies achieving ≥ 7 points were deemed high-quality, and any evaluation discrepancies were resolved through consultation with a third independent researcher to reach consensus.\nThe statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.1. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was selected as the analytical method. If the P-value was greater than 0.10 and I² was less than or equal to 50%, it was considered that there was no statistically significant heterogeneity between the results of the studies, at which point Meta-analysis was carried out using the fixed-effects model. If the results of the heterogeneity test showed the existence of significant heterogeneity, the random effects model was used for analysis. For survival data, the Hazard Ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were used for pooling and analysis. For statistical analysis,\nPublication bias was assessed through funnel plot visualization complemented by quantitative Egger’s regression test, where\nFor sensitivity analysis, a leave-one-out approach was systematically implemented. This involved iteratively excluding individual studies to evaluate result stability, with robustness confirmed when the pooled effect estimates changed by less than 10% upon removal of any single study.\nThe preliminary screening of the relevant literature 6065 articles, excluding duplicates and irrelevant literature of this study to obtain the literature 3691 articles; after re-screening to exclude the literature that does not meet the inclusion criteria, read through the article, and finally included 12 articles. There were 1731 participants in total. The healthy control and patient groups demonstrated comparable baseline characteristics with no significant differences. The process of literature screening is shown in Fig.\n\nLiterature screening flowchart\n\nList of basic characteristics of included studies\n①Serum GFAP level ②Serum NfL level\n\nGFAP and NfL levels in MS and NMOSD diseases\nSix of the 12 included studies described specific randomization methods, and the selective bias arising from the corresponding randomization sequence was assessed as “low risk”. None of the eight studies provided a description of blinding and allocation concealment, so they were evaluated as “high risk” or “unclear. In addition, none of the studies reported the number of dropouts/withdrawals, and none of them selectively reported the results of the studies, so they were evaluated as “low risk”. For other sources of bias, eight studies were evaluated as “unclear” due to insufficient information in the original study, as shown in Figs.\n\nPercentage chart of risk of bias assessment for included studies\n\nScatterplot of risk of bias assessment for included studies\nNine studies (1335 patients in total, 602 MS patients and 733 healthy controls) analyzed the differences in NfL levels between MS patients and healthy controls. There was significant heterogeneity among the studies (I²=75.58%), so the random effects model was used for effect size analysis.

Disease stages were classified based on clinical symptoms. During the exacerbation phase, the disease is in an acute attack or rapid progression stage, with patients developing new neurological deficit symptoms within a short period. The GFAP levels in patients during the exacerbation phase showed a statistically significant difference compared to the healthy control group [MD = 2.38, 95% CI (1.40, 3.37),\n\nForest plot of GFAP levels in MS patients with different disease stages\nThree studies performed survival analysis of GFAP in MS.

Funnel plots were generated, and Figs.\n\nFunnel plot of GFAP levels in MS\n\nFunnel plot of NfL levels in MS\nThe sensitivity analysis illustrated the meta-analysis results of GFAP and NfL levels in MS after sequentially excluding individual studies. Upon removing studies such as Aktas O 2021, the effect size estimates fluctuated between 0.30 and 1.11, with no extreme deviations observed in the corresponding confidence intervals. This indicates that the meta-analysis results are relatively robust, with each study’s influence on the overall outcome falling within a reasonable range, demonstrating high reliability, as shown in Figs.\n\nSensitivity analysis of GFAP levels in MS\n\nSensitivity analysis of NfL levels in MS\nBoth MS and NMOSD are immune-mediated inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, and despite significant differences in their pathogenesis and clinical manifestations, they both involve an abnormal immune system attack on the nervous system.MS is widely recognized as a classic immune-mediated demyelinating disease, whose main pathological feature is a T-cell-mediated immune response [\nThis study was screened and finally included 12 papers involving 1731 patients. In MS, GFAP levels were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls. It has been shown that GFAP levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be a potential biomarker of disease progression in MS [\nThe present study showed that in both MS and NMOSD, patients had significantly higher levels of NfL than healthy controls. One biomarker is neurofilament light chain, which has been found to be increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system [\nAnalysis of different disease stages showed that GFAP levels were significantly elevated in MS patients during the deteriorating and active phases, and to a lesser extent during the remission phase. In both relapsing and active phases of MS, intense inflammatory responses within the central nervous system (CNS) drive massive immune cell infiltration, attacking myelin sheaths and neurons to induce neuroaxonal damage. As a specific intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in astrocytes (AS), GFAP undergoes substantial upregulation during neuroinflammation. Upon CNS injury, astrocytes become robustly activated, undergoing hypertrophy and hyperplasia while initiating key intracellular signaling pathways (e.g., JAK-STAT and MAPK cascades). This activation triggers dramatically enhanced GFAP gene transcription and protein synthesis. Concomitantly, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption caused by neuroinflammatory damage facilitates massive leakage of CNS-derived GFAP into the systemic circulation. This dual mechanism—cellular upregulation and barrier dysfunction—accounts for the significant elevation of GFAP levels observed in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during active disease stages. A study by Kim [\nThe survival analysis for GFAP in MS showed non-significant results (HR = 1.78,\nAlthough this study provides systematic evidence for the clinical application of GFAP and NfL in MS and NMOSD by Meta-analysis, there are still some non-negligible limitations. First, the included studies differed significantly in terms of sample size, study design, experimental methods, and measurement criteria, and this heterogeneity may lead to complexity in data integration and potentially affect the accuracy and reliability of the analyzed results. In this study, significant heterogeneity was observed in GFAP levels among MS patients (I²=75.58%). This heterogeneity may be attributable to several factors: (1) Variations in detection methods: Some studies utilized ELISA, while others employed electrochemiluminescence; differing assay sensitivities could lead to result fluctuations. (2) Population characteristics: The included studies encompassed diverse ethnicities (e.g., Asian, European populations) and disease subtypes (relapsing-remitting MS vs. progressive MS). (3) Sample type: While most studies measured serum GFAP, GFAP levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples may more directly reflect central nervous system injury. Currently, subgroup analyses to investigate sources of heterogeneity are unavailable due to the limited number of published studies; however, as more studies emerge, future research should implement subgroup analyses (e.g., stratifying by sample types and detection methodologies) to refine the investigation and obtain more precise estimates. Second, this study failed to adequately adjust for potential confounding factors, such as patients’ immunotherapy regimens, comorbidities, or concurrent conditions. These variables could significantly influence changes in GFAP and NfL levels, potentially compromising the accuracy of the results. Consequently, this limitation may impact the practical clinical utility of these biomarkers for prognostic evaluation in disease. Future studies need to exert stricter control over these factors. Therefore, future studies should further consider the potential interference of these factors and conduct more long-term, standardized prospective studies to validate the predictive efficacy and clinical utility of GFAP and NfL in MS and NMOSD.\n\nSupplementary Material 1.", "content_for_embedding": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are two common chronic inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, which, despite their similarities in pathological basis, show significant differences in pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and epidemiological features. Globally, the incidence of MS is higher in the European region, with a significantly higher number of female patients, and the age of onset is usually centered between 20 and 40 years [\nGlial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), a protein synthesized by astrocytes, has been identified as a sensitive biomarker of CNS injury and has shown significant diagnostic and prognostic value in a variety of neuroimmune diseases [\nIn this study, a comprehensive review of the research literature related to GFAP in the prognosis of neuroimmune diseases was conducted by computerized searches of the following multiple databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, Wanfang, PubMed, Wiley Online Library, and Web of Science. The time frame of the search was from inception to December 1, 2024 to ensure that the latest research results in the related fields were covered. In order to ensure systematic and comprehensive literature retrieval, this study will implement manual secondary search methods—including reviewing high-quality syntheses, extracting relevant content, and scanning reference lists—thereby bridging potential gaps in computerized searches and guaranteeing broad coverage and representativeness of included literature, which provides solid data support and theoretical foundation for subsequent reviews. Search terms include: GFAP、Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein、Multiple Sclerosis、MS、prognosis、Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders、NMOSD; Using Pubmed as an example, the search formula is as follows: ((((GFAP) OR (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)) AND (Multiple Sclerosis)) OR (MS)) AND (prognosis); ((((GFAP) OR (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)) AND (Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders)) OR (NMOSD)) AND (prognosis). This systematic review has been performed and written in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n\nInclusion criteria: (1) The study subjects are MS or NMOSD patients. (2) The study contains GFAP related test data, and there are indicators about GFAP and disease diagnosis and prognosis. (3) The type of study is an original study (including prospective study, retrospective study, etc.), such as cohort study, case-control study, etc. (4) Provide clear data.\nExclusion criteria: (1) Repeatedly published literature. (2) Literature types without original data such as reviews, commentaries, conference abstracts, and case reports. (3) Literature that did not explicitly mention the relationship between GFAP and the diagnosis and prognosis of MS or NMOSD in the study. (4) Literature with incomplete data or key data that could not be extracted for Meta-analysis.\n(1) Comparison of NfL and GFAP serum levels in MS and NMOSD patients with healthy controls; (2) Survival analysis of MS and NMOSD patients.\nThe endpoints of survival analysis are disease recurrence or death. Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from disease diagnosis to death. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) refers to the duration from the initiation of treatment to the occurrence of disease recurrence.\nDuring the literature analysis, the researchers independently extracted key information from the studies, including fundamental data such as the study period, year of publication, first author, and affiliated research institution. Simultaneously, they analyzed and interpreted the research methods, experimental design, study subjects, statistical indicators of the results, and their clinical significance. In cases of differing interpretations or evaluations, an independent third-party expert was invited for peer review, with consensus reached through thorough discussion and verification. For instances where data were missing, descriptions were unclear, or detailed information was unavailable, the researchers attempted to contact the corresponding author of the study to obtain the most recent and accurate supplementary materials. If supplemental information could not be obtained within a reasonable timeframe or remained ambiguous, the study was excluded to ensure the scientific rigor of the literature review and the reliability of the data.\nThe quality assessment of the literature was conducted independently by two researchers with professional expertise in the relevant field to ensure a high level of objectivity and accuracy in the evaluation process. All pertinent information, including baseline data and outcome measures, was systematically recorded and organized in an Excel spreadsheet to ensure data integrity and traceability. The researchers performed a comprehensive and standardized quality assessment of the included literature, rigorously evaluating each intervention using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool in RevMan 5.4.1, and analyzed their potential risk of bias. The risk of bias was assessed according to established methodological criteria. Random sequence generation was classified as low risk if computer-generated randomization or random number tables were employed, and high/unclear risk otherwise. Allocation concealment was deemed low risk only when robust methods such as sealed opaque envelopes were implemented, otherwise categorized as high/unclear risk. For blinding procedures, low risk required blinding of both investigators and participants; absence of blinding resulted in high/unclear risk classification. Attrition bias was rated low risk when attrition rates remained below 10% with explicit documentation of withdrawal reasons, and high risk if these conditions were unmet. Finally, selective reporting was judged low risk exclusively for studies with prospectively registered protocols and complete outcome reporting; all other cases were designated high risk.
