The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University (Approval Number: KY2024-156-02), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their inclusion.\nAll enrolled patients received general language assessment within 3 days. Initially, the Chinese version of the WAB was administered to calculate the AQ and classify aphasia types (\nSubsequently, patients underwent an extended language assessment using the CALB naming battery (CALB-nb), which comprises eight subtasks. Assessments were administered on a Lenovo YOGA TABLET (Lenovo YT3-X50F, Android 6.0.1), with all instructions automatically delivered by the device and supervised by a trained therapist. Before each subtask, 2–3 practice trials were conducted to ensure the patient fully understood the task requirements. Stimuli were presented visually or auditorily, and each subtask consisted of 12–70 test trials involving both target and distractor options. A correct response within the time limit was scored as correct; incorrect responses, mispronunciations, or timeouts were not scored. For patients with motor impairments preventing touchscreen use, the therapist assisted in response selection based on the patient’s indications. The eight subtasks included: auditory discrimination, tone recognition, auditory lexical decision, confrontation naming, auditory comprehension, semantic association, non-word repetition and word repetition. These tasks were designed to evaluate various stages of language processing, including phonological input, tonal and phonological decoding, lexical comprehension, semantic association, and both phonological and lexical output. Specific lexical processing abilities such as lexical categorization and verb argument structure were inferred based on performance across different lexical categories. As all tasks were presented using visual or auditory modalities, the patient’s visual and auditory perception abilities were also indirectly assessed based on their accuracy and response patterns. All assessments were conducted in a quiet speech and language therapy room (see\nA telephone follow-up was conducted 1 year after enrollment to assess patients’ functional speech using the ASRS. Each evaluation was performed by one therapist during a 10–20-min conversation with the patient, while two additional therapists observed simultaneously. Patients were encouraged to engage in spontaneous speech by responding to open-ended questions on topics such as recent daily activities, emotional states, interactions with caregivers, and the role of family in their language rehabilitation. All three therapists independently rated the patient’s functional speech using the ASRS, and the most frequently assigned score among the three was recorded as the final score.\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 26.0 and figures were created using Origin 2021 and GraphPad Prism 9.5. Continuous variables, including the WAB subtest scores and AQ, were analyzed as scaled variables. To facilitate comparison across subtests, individual WAB subtest scores were normalized to a 10-point scale. The AQ was calculated using the standard formula:\n\nThe AQ ranges from 0 to 100, with severity of aphasia classified according to established thresholds: mild (AQ 50.4–93.7), moderate (AQ 30.1–50.3), and severe (AQ 0–30.0), based on Chinese reference criteria (\nDescriptive statistics were first computed to characterize the overall linguistic profile of participants. For continuous variables, means, standard deviations (SD), and ranges were reported. Frequencies and percentages were used to summarize categorical variables. Between-group comparisons were performed using independent sample t-tests for normally distributed continuous variables and Mann–Whitney U tests for non-parametric distributions. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. For comparisons involving more than two groups, a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by Least Significant Difference (LSD)\nTo explore relationships among specific language domains, pairwise Pearson correlation analyses were conducted among the 11 CALB-nb domain accuracy. Correlation coefficients (\nAmong the 34 enrolled patients, more than half were classified as having fluent aphasia (55.88%). In terms of aphasia type, nearly half were diagnosed with anomic aphasia (47.1%), followed by Broca’s aphasia, which accounted for approximately one-third of the cohort (29.4%) (\nLanguage performance of patients with subcortical aphasia.\nIn terms of performance across specific language processing domains, patients achieved the highest accuracy in the TD task (\nCorrelation matrix of CALB-nb subtask accuracy.\nThe Pearson correlation analysis revealed significant correlations among language domains.

Among those who completed the follow-up assessment, 73.6% of patients showed substantial language recovery, attaining ASRS scores of 4–5, indicative of near-normal language function (\nASRS scores of 1 year follow-up patients.\nThis study investigated the language characteristics of patients with subcortical aphasia using both standardized assessments and domain-specific language tasks. The findings revealed several key patterns that advance our understanding of the nature and structure of language impairment following subcortical stroke.\nFirst, the distribution of aphasia subtypes in the cohort highlighted the predominance of fluent forms of aphasia, with anomic aphasia being the most frequent (47.1%), followed by Broca’s aphasia (29.4%). This finding aligns with prior studies suggesting that subcortical lesions, particularly those sparing key cortical speech areas, often result in less severe and more fluent aphasia presentations (\nSecond, the results of the CALB-nb provided more granular insights into language processing deficits. The highest accuracy was observed in TD, while tasks requiring LfW and VAS were most challenging. LfW accuracy reflects patients’ ability to process low-frequency nouns, while VAS measures their performance across different argument structures. Both metrics are also associated with higher-order lexical-semantic processing abilities. These results suggest that while lower-level auditory perceptual abilities are often preserved, higher-order lexical-semantic processes may be disproportionately affected by subcortical damage. Previous studies have demonstrated that thalamic aphasia is predominantly characterized by disturbances in lexical-semantic processing, whereas language impairments resulting from basal ganglia lesions are more often associated with procedural dysfunctions, particularly those affecting the processing of syntactic and rule-governed language structures (\nCorrelation analyses further revealed significant positive relationships between multiple language domains. Notably, PO was strongly associated with both auditory perception and PD, emphasizing the interdependence between perceptual input and motor output pathways. Similarly, ALC showed strong correlations with both VAS and LfW, suggesting its central role in mediating access to semantic knowledge. This suggests that auditory comprehension is a complex procedure involving higher-order lexical-semantic operations. Furthermore, the extremely high correlations observed between NC and AE, as well as between LfW and VAS, point to semantic organization being a highly unified construct in these patients. This may reflect the distributed but interdependent nature of semantic representation, where impairments in one area are likely to be accompanied by deficits in another. In other words, semantic processing involves an interactive flow of information between processing stages, rather than a series of strictly discrete steps (\nTo further investigate the core linguistic deficits in subcortical aphasia, PCA was implemented to reduce dimensionality across linguistic variables. The results identified two key components accounting for 77.34% of the total variance. The first component, linked to\nImportantly, our follow-up data indicated that 73.6% of patients achieved ASRS scores of 4–5 at 1 year, indicating near-normal communicative function. Five patients even returned to their pre-stroke employment. Further analysis of the RTW group revealed that these patients were generally younger and demonstrated better performance in phonological processing tasks. Although the current sample size was limited, these findings suggest the need for future studies with larger cohorts to investigate language-related prognostic factors.\nResearchers have sought to elucidate the role of subcortical structures in aphasia through four proposed mechanisms: (1) direct involvement of subcortical nuclei in language processing (\nThe current study applied the CALB to Chinese-speaking populations, providing further evidence of profound language impairments in patients with subcortical aphasia, particularly in lexical and semantic processing. The CALB effectively captured aphasia severity, demonstrating its clinical utility as a routine assessment tool for subcortical aphasia. Its sensitivity in detecting subtle language disorders enables early identification of these impairments. Future research could integrate CALB evaluations with quantitative lesion-symptom mapping to further investigate these neural-language relationships.\nIn conclusion, our findings highlight the heterogeneous yet structured nature of language impairment in subcortical aphasia. Phonological, lexical, and semantic deficits often co-occur, but they can be decomposed into distinct dimensions that reflect overall language function. The results underscore the importance of multidimensional assessment tools and support a network-based model of language. These insights have direct implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and the design of targeted rehabilitation programs in aphasia care. Future study should focus on the tractography and cortical connectivity studies to explore the potential mechanism of subcortical lesions in language.\nNonetheless, the study has several limitations that warrant consideration.

Continuous variables, including the WAB subtest scores and AQ, were analyzed as scaled variables. To facilitate comparison across subtests, individual WAB subtest scores were normalized to a 10-point scale. The AQ was calculated using the standard formula:\n\nThe AQ ranges from 0 to 100, with severity of aphasia classified according to established thresholds: mild (AQ 50.4–93.7), moderate (AQ 30.1–50.3), and severe (AQ 0–30.0), based on Chinese reference criteria (\nDescriptive statistics were first computed to characterize the overall linguistic profile of participants. For continuous variables, means, standard deviations (SD), and ranges were reported. Frequencies and percentages were used to summarize categorical variables. Between-group comparisons were performed using independent sample t-tests for normally distributed continuous variables and Mann–Whitney U tests for non-parametric distributions. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. For comparisons involving more than two groups, a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by Least Significant Difference (LSD)\nTo explore relationships among specific language domains, pairwise Pearson correlation analyses were conducted among the 11 CALB-nb domain accuracy. Correlation coefficients (\nAmong the 34 enrolled patients, more than half were classified as having fluent aphasia (55.88%). In terms of aphasia type, nearly half were diagnosed with anomic aphasia (47.1%), followed by Broca’s aphasia, which accounted for approximately one-third of the cohort (29.4%) (\nLanguage performance of patients with subcortical aphasia.\nIn terms of performance across specific language processing domains, patients achieved the highest accuracy in the TD task (\nCorrelation matrix of CALB-nb subtask accuracy.\nThe Pearson correlation analysis revealed significant correlations among language domains. Subsequently, PCA was employed for dimensionality reduction of variables. Variables included in the analysis were derived from CALB-nb language task accuracy. Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant (\nResults of PCA analysis.\nA composite score (\nLinear regression analysis of AQ score and composite score (\nAt the one-year follow-up, a small proportion of patients were lost to follow-up (5.9%), and two patients (2.9%) had died of stroke recurrence. Among those who completed the follow-up assessment, 73.6% of patients showed substantial language recovery, attaining ASRS scores of 4–5, indicative of near-normal language function (\nASRS scores of 1 year follow-up patients.\nThis study investigated the language characteristics of patients with subcortical aphasia using both standardized assessments and domain-specific language tasks. The findings revealed several key patterns that advance our understanding of the nature and structure of language impairment following subcortical stroke.\nFirst, the distribution of aphasia subtypes in the cohort highlighted the predominance of fluent forms of aphasia, with anomic aphasia being the most frequent (47.1%), followed by Broca’s aphasia (29.4%). This finding aligns with prior studies suggesting that subcortical lesions, particularly those sparing key cortical speech areas, often result in less severe and more fluent aphasia presentations (\nSecond, the results of the CALB-nb provided more granular insights into language processing deficits. The highest accuracy was observed in TD, while tasks requiring LfW and VAS were most challenging. LfW accuracy reflects patients’ ability to process low-frequency nouns, while VAS measures their performance across different argument structures. Both metrics are also associated with higher-order lexical-semantic processing abilities. These results suggest that while lower-level auditory perceptual abilities are often preserved, higher-order lexical-semantic processes may be disproportionately affected by subcortical damage. Previous studies have demonstrated that thalamic aphasia is predominantly characterized by disturbances in lexical-semantic processing, whereas language impairments resulting from basal ganglia lesions are more often associated with procedural dysfunctions, particularly those affecting the processing of syntactic and rule-governed language structures (\nCorrelation analyses further revealed significant positive relationships between multiple language domains. Notably, PO was strongly associated with both auditory perception and PD, emphasizing the interdependence between perceptual input and motor output pathways. Similarly, ALC showed strong correlations with both VAS and LfW, suggesting its central role in mediating access to semantic knowledge. This suggests that auditory comprehension is a complex procedure involving higher-order lexical-semantic operations. Furthermore, the extremely high correlations observed between NC and AE, as well as between LfW and VAS, point to semantic organization being a highly unified construct in these patients. This may reflect the distributed but interdependent nature of semantic representation, where impairments in one area are likely to be accompanied by deficits in another. In other words, semantic processing involves an interactive flow of information between processing stages, rather than a series of strictly discrete steps (\nTo further investigate the core linguistic deficits in subcortical aphasia, PCA was implemented to reduce dimensionality across linguistic variables. The results identified two key components accounting for 77.34% of the total variance. The first component, linked to\nImportantly, our follow-up data indicated that 73.6% of patients achieved ASRS scores of 4–5 at 1 year, indicating near-normal communicative function. Five patients even returned to their pre-stroke employment. Further analysis of the RTW group revealed that these patients were generally younger and demonstrated better performance in phonological processing tasks. Although the current sample size was limited, these findings suggest the need for future studies with larger cohorts to investigate language-related prognostic factors.\nResearchers have sought to elucidate the role of subcortical structures in aphasia through four proposed mechanisms: (1) direct involvement of subcortical nuclei in language processing (\nThe current study applied the CALB to Chinese-speaking populations, providing further evidence of profound language impairments in patients with subcortical aphasia, particularly in lexical and semantic processing. The CALB effectively captured aphasia severity, demonstrating its clinical utility as a routine assessment tool for subcortical aphasia. Its sensitivity in detecting subtle language disorders enables early identification of these impairments. Future research could integrate CALB evaluations with quantitative lesion-symptom mapping to further investigate these neural-language relationships.\nIn conclusion, our findings highlight the heterogeneous yet structured nature of language impairment in subcortical aphasia. Phonological, lexical, and semantic deficits often co-occur, but they can be decomposed into distinct dimensions that reflect overall language function. The results underscore the importance of multidimensional assessment tools and support a network-based model of language. These insights have direct implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and the design of targeted rehabilitation programs in aphasia care. Future study should focus on the tractography and cortical connectivity studies to explore the potential mechanism of subcortical lesions in language.\nNonetheless, the study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, the sample size was relatively small. Although, the", "topic": "Neurotransmitter"}

As shown in Table S3, patients in the dexmedetomidine group were younger (median: 58.000 vs. 62.000 years,\nIn the matched cohort, we further explored the association between dexmedetomidine use and postoperative RF and in-hospital mortality (Table\nAssociation of dexmedetomidine use with postoperative RF and in-hospital mortality after PSM\nAdjusted for cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, SAPS II, APS III, RDW, PTT, hemoglobin, and platelet count. **\nRF: respiratory failure, PSM: propensity score matching, APS III: Acute Physiology Score III, SAPS II: simplified acute physiology score II, RDW: red cell distribution width, PTT: partial thromboplastin time, OR: odds ratio, CI: confidence interval\nTo explore whether the association between dexmedetomidine use and postoperative RF or in-hospital mortality varied by patient characteristics (including age, gender, BMI, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, and surgical interventions), subgroup analyses and interaction tests were conducted (Table\nInteraction effects and subgroup analyses between dexmedetomidine use and postoperative RF/in-hospital mortality\n*\nRF: respiratory failure, BMI: body mass index, OR: odds ratio, CI: confidence interval\nTo further investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine use on postoperative outcomes in patients with non-traumatic SAH, a competing risk model was constructed, in which postoperative RF was defined as the event of interest, and in-hospital mortality was treated as the competing event (Table\nCompeting risk analysis of dexmedetomidine use and clinical outcomes\nAdjusting for cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, SAPS II, APS III, RDW, PTT, hemoglobin, and platelet count. ***\nRF: respiratory failure, PSM: propensity score matching, APS III: Acute Physiology Score III, SAPS II: simplified acute physiology score II, RDW: red cell distribution width, PTT: partial thromboplastin time, CI: confidence interval\nTo further investigate the impact of dexmedetomidine usage characteristics on postoperative outcomes in patients with non-traumatic SAH, we included both the dosage and duration of dexmedetomidine administration as continuous variables to assess their association with postoperative RF and in-hospital mortality (Table\nAssociation of dexmedetomidine duration/use with postoperative RF and in-hospital mortality\nRF: respiratory failure, OR: odds ratio, CI: confidence interval\nThis study explored the association between the use of dexmedetomidine and postoperative RF and in-hospital mortality in patients with non-traumatic SAH. The results revealed a complex and clinically significant relationship. Traditional regression models indicated that dexmedetomidine use was associated with an increased risk of postoperative RF, while a decreased risk of in-hospital mortality. However, when RF and in-hospital mortality events were considered using a competing risk model, the effect of dexmedetomidine on RF was no longer significant, while its protective effect on in-hospital mortality remained robust. This finding suggests that dexmedetomidine may produce complex physiological effects in non-traumatic SAH patients.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that dexmedetomidine possesses sedative, analgesic, and sympatholytic properties, which make it widely used in neurocritical care [\nDespite the potential risks to the respiratory system, the logistical regression models showed that dexmedetomidine has a significant protective effect on in-hospital mortality in this study. These results remained stable after multivariable adjustments. This finding is consistent with the study by Liu et al., who also found that dexmedetomidine use was associated with a reduction in in-hospital mortality in SAH patients undergoing surgery [\nThe seemingly contradictory effects of dexmedetomidine on postoperative RF and in-hospital mortality may be due to the traditional logistic regression models. These models do not account for the time-dependent nature and competing relationships of clinical outcomes. In this study, RF and in-hospital death were not independent events. RF either occurred before death or simultaneously, which may have influenced the observed associations. To address this, we further conducted a competing risk analysis. The introduction of the competing risk model is more in line with actual clinical practice. For non-traumatic SAH patients, RF and death do not occur independently but are dynamically interwoven clinical outcomes. In this study, in-hospital death was considered a competing event to RF. Interestingly, while logistic regression suggested an increased RF risk with dexmedetomidine, this association became non-significant when accounting for competing risks. This difference may reflect the “dual effect” of dexmedetomidine in clinical practice. On one hand, the sedative may impact respiratory function by lowering central respiratory drive, affecting oxygenation, and worsening ventilation in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases [\nThe results of this study suggest that clinical decisions regarding sedation strategies should be more individualized. Dexmedetomidine demonstrated significant potential in reducing in-hospital mortality in non-traumatic SAH patients, particularly in younger individuals without a history of cerebrovascular disease. This suggests that it could be considered the preferred sedative for perioperative management in such patients. However, for those with poor lung function or elevated respiratory risk, the use of pulmonary protective measures should be considered, along with close monitoring of respiratory function, assessing the depth of sedation, and avoiding delays in recognizing respiratory deterioration. This study also has certain limitations. First, as an observational study, although confounding factors were controlled through multivariable adjustments and statistical modeling, causality cannot be established. Second, this study was based on data from a single-center ICU cohort in the MIMIC-IV database. While it provides high-quality and comprehensive clinical variables, the patient population and healthcare practices may differ from those in other regions, which limits the generalizability and applicability of the findings to broader populations. Third, the operational definition of postoperative RF based on ICD codes and PaO₂ thresholds may lack specificity and could lead to misclassification of hypoxemia or other pulmonary complications. Moreover, the interaction\nThis study found that dexmedetomidine use was associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality among patients with non-traumatic SAH, and this protective effect was consistently observed across multiple statistical models. However, the relationship between dexmedetomidine and postoperative RF appeared more complex. While initial analyses suggested an increased risk, subsequent competing risk analysis did not support a significant association. These findings indicate that the use of dexmedetomidine in neurocritical care should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of individual patient risk. Future prospective randomized controlled trials are warranted to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to identify the patient populations most likely to benefit from dexmedetomidine therapy.\n\nAdditional file 1.\nAdditional file 2.\nAdditional file 3.\nAdditional file 4.\nAdditional file 5.", "content_for_embedding": "Non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a common form of stroke in the intensive care unit (ICU).

After filtering based on the criteria of OB ≥30%, DL ≥0.18, and HL ≥4 h, we retained 13 active compounds corresponding to 204 traditional Chinese medicines related to eight core proteins. The eight core proteins include Tumor Protein p53 (TP53), selectin L (SELL), REN, protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 6 (PTPN6), 5′ (3′)-deoxyribonuclease (NT5E), galectin-3 (LGALS3), Jun Proto-Oncogene (JUN), and MHC, Class II Invariant Chain (CD74).\nWe have chosen core compounds and their corresponding core proteins for molecular docking, and the results show that the binding energy of each protein with each compound is less than −5 kcal/mol, indicating that there is good binding activity between each protein and compound (\nThe root mean square deviation (RMSD) is a good indicator for measuring the conformational stability of proteins and ligands, as well as the degree of deviation of atomic positions from their initial positions. The smaller the deviation, the better the conformational stability. Therefore, the equilibrium of the simulation system was assessed using RMSD (\nFurther analysis revealed that the radius of gyration (Rg) and the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of the CD74-quercetin, TP53-wogonin, JUN-berberine, NT5E-quercetin, and TP53-berberine complexes fluctuated stably during the motion, indicating that the target protein-small molecule complexes remained stable and compact throughout the simulation process (\nHydrogen bonds play a significant role in the binding of ligands to proteins. The number of hydrogen bonds between the small molecules and target proteins during the dynamics is shown in\nThe root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) can represent the flexibility of amino acid residues in proteins. As shown in\nIn summary, this group of small molecules interacts well with the target proteins. Notably, the CD74-quercetin complex exhibits more stable binding, and the complex has good hydrogen bonding interactions.\nIBS is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal discomfort or pain related to defecation and a change in bowel habits, without evidence of organic lesions [\nCurrently, proteomics has been widely applied in the study of inflammatory diseases, immune diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer, aiding in the in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms, the discovery of biomarkers, and the development of new therapies [\nWe performed GO enrichment on these 169 proteins and found that the characteristic of IBS lies in its complex immune regulatory network, involving the adhesion, proliferation, and migration of immune cells, as well as the fine-tuning of immune responses. These processes occur in specific cellular structures, such as the secretory granule membrane and microvillus membrane, which are crucial for immune function. Furthermore, the diversity of MFs in IBS, including key molecular activities in immune recognition and signal transduction, further emphasizes the complexity of immune regulation and cell-to-cell communication involved in the disease.\nKEGG enrichment analysis suggests that the pathophysiology of IBS involves the activation of the immune system, intercellular signal transmission, and the regulation of metabolic pathways. The interaction between viral proteins and cytokines and receptors, cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, B-cell signaling pathways, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways are all potential etiological factors of IBS.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding through the gastrointestinal tract leads to epithelial barrier damage, immune activation, changes in microbiota composition, dysregulation of the serotonin pathway, and intestinal neuropathy, which may be significant factors contributing to the high incidence of IBS in patients during acute infection and postrecovery [\nBased on the results of KEGG enrichment analysis, there may be a causal link between the B-cell signaling pathway and IBS. Specifically, the study found that in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS, there is an enhancement of the humoral immune response in the jejunum, which is closely related to clinical manifestations [\nThe activity of the REN–angiotensin system may be involved in the pathogenesis of IBS. Under the influence of long-term chronic stress, the inflammatory response of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis may induce IBS [\nOur research results suggest that the JAK-STAT signaling pathway may be closely related to the occurrence of IBS. In patients with IBS-D and stress model mice, there is a significant increase in xanthine levels in the serum metabolome [\nThrough PPI network and topological analysis, we identified 19 core proteins out of the 169 proteins, and through reverse network pharmacology and rigorous filtering, we retained eight core proteins and 13 active compounds that have a relationship with them, which are present in 204 traditional Chinese medicines. By further applying topological analysis to the active compounds, we determined that quercetin, berberine, and wogonin may be key compounds for the treatment of IBS, while PAC and ABR may be potentially effective traditional Chinese medicines for the treatment of IBS. Additionally, we conducted molecular docking and MD simulations, and the results indicated that each protein has good binding stability with its corresponding compound.\nPreclinical studies have found that quercetin shows potential therapeutic effects on postinflammatory IBS (PI-IBS) by reducing 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels and regulating the differentiation of enteroendocrine cells, increasing pain thresholds, and reducing visceral motor responses [\nOur research found that berberine may treat IBS by targeting TP53 and JUN, two proteins that have a potential causal relationship with the pathogenesis of IBS, but further experimental validation is still needed. Systematic reviews and network pharmacology studies suggest that wogonin, as one of the key chemical metabolites in traditional Chinese medicine formulations, may have potential therapeutic effects on IBS-D and its associated anxiety and depressive symptoms [\nPAC, also known as Guan Huang Bai, originates from the bark of\nDespite employing various statistical methods to enhance the robustness of our research findings, such as conducting pleiotropy tests and heterogeneity tests to confirm the reliability of the results, our study still faces some notable limitations. First, our research only covered pQTL data for 2941 proteins, which may limit our ability to identify a broader range of protein expression variations. Second, the IBS samples we selected were predominantly from European populations, raising questions about the generalizability of our findings to other races or ethnic groups. In the network pharmacology section, we chose proteins with a degree value of 10 or higher based on topological analysis and applied stringent selection criteria for the active compounds interacting with these proteins, which may have led to the omission of some compounds that could be effective in treating IBS. Lastly, and most critically, our conclusions are based on predictions of causal relationships and database analyses, which require further experimental validation for support.\nOur research integrates proteomics data and explores the possible etiology of IBS from a causal perspective. Additionally, we have newly discovered the potential of PAC and ABR, two traditional Chinese medicines, in treating IBS, as well as potential therapeutic targets. However, these conclusions require further validation.", "topic": "Neurotransmitter"}

However, the specific microbiota contributing to symptoms remain unclear. To characterize the gut microbial profile related to different symptoms and explore the mediation mechanism between microbiota alterations and the core ADHD symptoms, we conducted shotgun metagenomic sequencing and fecal metabolomics analysis on 94 ADHD patients and 94 age- and gender-matched controls. Microbial characteristics of three subgroups exhibiting different ADHD core symptom presentations were analyzed. We developed a metabolic model and conducted causal mediation analyses to examine how metabolites connect the microbiota to the symptoms. Fecal microbiota transplantation in mice was employed to validate the findings. The redundancy analysis identified ADHD symptoms as environmental gradients and explained the changes in beta diversity (F = 1.345, pFDR = 0.015). Greater gut microbial alterations were observed in combined presentations (ADHD-C). Several beneficial bacteria involved in short-chain fatty acid synthesis were found to be downregulated, with Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis notably linked to all three core symptoms (p.adj = 1.04E–13; p.adj = 5.07E–07; p.adj = 2.61E–05). Various taxa, functional pathways, and metabolites associated with specific ADHD symptom domains were identified. Imidazoleacetic acid partially mediated the effects between Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and inattention (p = 0.012). In mice subjected to feces from ADHD patients with a low abundance of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, treatment with this strain greatly improved both hyperactivity (t = 2.665, p = 0.0237) and inattention (t = 2.389, p = 0.0380), while acetate supplementation only alleviated inattention (t = 2.362, p = 0.0398). Our findings suggest that different ADHD symptoms were related to common and different gut microbiota and metabolites.

The gut microbiota is commonly considered to regulate neurodevelopment through three pathways – the immune pathway, the neuronal pathway, and the endocrine/systemic pathway, with overlaps and interaction in between.\nResearch has shown that many ADHD-related risk factors also influence the microbiota, such as delivery method, gestational age, type of feeding, maternal health, and early life stressors.\nPrevious studies utilizing 16S rRNA gene amplicon or shotgun metagenomic sequencing have preliminarily identified differences in gut microbiota composition between ADHD and controls.\nOne hundred and eighty-eight participants aged 6–16 years were recruited from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Center at Peking University Sixth Hospital, Yan’an Third People’s Hospital, and local schools. Of these, 94 were ADHD patients and 94 were age- and gender-matched healthy controls.

The QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer, equipped with an ESI Turbo Ion Spray interface, was operated with the following parameters: ion source temperature at 400°C, ion spray voltage (IS) at 4500 V (positive mode) and −4500 V (negative mode), and ion source gases I (GS1), II (GS2), and curtain gas (CUR) set to 60, 60, and 35 psi, respectively.\nQuantitative analysis was performed using Skyline software (v.21.1.0.146). This software, configured for monoisotopic peaks with a mass tolerance of 0.6 Da and a mass range of 50–1500 Da, was used to generate a data matrix that included metabolite identification and quantification results for subsequent information analysis and processing. Quality control (QC) samples were generated from a mixture of sample extracts to assess the consistency of the sample under identical treatment. During data collection, a certain number of QC samples were inserted in test samples to monitor the repeatability of the analytical process.

After the acclimatization period, mice were orally administered a cocktail of four antibiotics (ABX) for 7 days: ampicillin (200 mg/kg/day, Solarbio Cat#A6920), vancomycin (100 mg/kg/day, VIANEX S.A. PLANTC), neomycin (200 mg/kg/day, SIGMA Cat#N6386), and metronidazole (200 mg/kg/day, SIGMA Cat#M1547).\nSubsequently, mice were subjected to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from ADHD patients with a low abundance of beneficial bacteria\nBehavioral experiments were conducted during the light period. Exploratory activity and hyperactivity behavior were measured using an Open-Field apparatus (40 × 40 × 25 cm). For the five days prior to the test, the mice were handled for 5 min every day, followed by a 5-min familiarization period in the box. Each mouse was placed in the center of the open-field apparatus. A square that was 10 cm from the wall was designated as the center zone. Traveled distance and time spent in the center zone of each animal were recorded for a single 4-min session with a video-imaging system.\nMice were trained using a Five-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5-CSRTT) procedure according to a published protocol and previous studies.\nDuring training, the LED of one of the five response holes will be on, and mice were trained to use their noses to locate the lit hole in order to receive a food pellet as a reward. Each session began with the illumination of the response holes light and the food magazine light, followed by the delivery of one food pellet (20 mg/pellet). Once the first food pellet was collected, the intertrial interval (ITI) commenced. At the end of the ITI, one of the five response holes on the chamber wall opposite the food magazine was illuminated for a brief period, known as the stimulus duration (SD). A correct response to this hole within the limited hold (LH) period resulted in the response holes light turning off, the food magazine light turning on, and delivery of one food pellet. After the pellet was collected, the next ITI began. The target stimulus varied pseudorandomly between trials to increase attentional load.\nTraining was divided into seven successive stages with specific criteria for ITI, SD, and LH, which had to be met for two consecutive days before progression to the next stage (Supplementary Fig. 6). A typical training session lasted 30 min or completed 100 trials, whichever came first. Responses into the non-target hole were considered incorrect responses, while responses during the ITI before target stimulus presentation were classified as premature responses, and a failure to respond was recorded as an omission. The average latency to correct responses and correct responses rate reflected the mice’s attention; the premature rate indicated the level of impulsivity.\nMice feces were collected before and after antibiotic treatment (ABX), after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and after the rescue procedure (\nAfter obtaining genus-level ASVs, the data were normalized to ensure sample comparability; sequence count normalization was conducted through rarefaction to address uneven sequencing depths by the ‘rrarefy’ function in Vegan,\nStatistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.2.0) and Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, version 26.0). Mean and standard deviation were utilized for continuous variables (including demographic data, dietary data, and psychometric parameters). Kruskal – Wallis tests and post-hoc Wilcoxon rank-sum pairwise tests, with p-values adjusted for multiple testing via the Benjamini – Hochberg method, were applied for inter-group comparisons. Correlation analysis was conducted using partial correlation analysis by the “spearman” method in the R package ppcor. When applicable, age, gender, BMI, SPM, site and principal component of diets were adjusted as covariates.

Detailed information on gut microbiota sequencing data was given in Supplementary Table 3. We employed species rarefaction curves to assess and predict the degree to which species richness in the community increases with sample size. The curve for groups TD, IA, and C exhibited a flat trajectory during the terminal phases, indicating that the sample sizes were adequate and the subsequent analyses were reasonable (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nIn terms of taxonomic diversity, we first compared the top 10 relative abundances of microbiota at the level of genus, the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio), alpha diversity, and beta diversity between ADHD subgroups and TDs. The relative abundance of the top 10 genera of microbiota (Phocaeicola, Bacteroides, Alistipes, Parabacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Bifidobacterium, Escherichia, Lachnospira, Megamonas, and others) did not differ significantly (pFDR >0.05;\nThe overview of the microbiome profiles in three ADHD presentations and TD.

S.obs (observed species) were used to estimate the indexes of the total number of species in the community. Shannon index, Simpson index, and Pielou’s evenness index were used to measure the microbial diversity in the sample. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) whole tree was the diversity index calculated the distance of the evolutionary tree.\nThe significance tests of the community structure with greater between-group difference than the within-group difference.\nAnosim similarity analysis is a non-parametric test to test whether the between-group difference is significantly greater than the difference within the group to judge whether the grouping is meaningful. MRPP analysis is similar to Anosim analysis, but the ordering method is different. It analyzes whether the microbial community structure difference between groups is significant. Adonis tests the differences between groups by partitioning the distance matrix among sources of variation and using a permutation test to assess the significance of these differences.\nFurthermore, we used constrained ordination analysis to investigate the correlation between the microbial community structure and ADHD symptoms in all participants. To identify the optimal distribution of our data model (either a linear, unimodal, or bimodal distribution), we implemented a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). The length value indicated that the linear model fitted our data, with the first axis (DCA1) having a length of 2.58 (less than 3) (Supplementary Table 4). We applied the redundancy analysis (RDA) to a linear model. We found that at the species level, Component 1 from the RDA explained 57.98% of the variance (22.88% with Component 2 scaling) (ANOVA like permutation test F = 1.345, pFDR = 0.015,\nThe ANOVA like permutation test of the redundancy analysis (RDA) between the microbial community structure and ADHD symptoms.\nRDA1 and RDA2 represent the proportion of species distribution explained by each axis in the analysis.

Species\nAfter gene prediction, the total number of genes we obtained and the distribution of genes with different lengths were displayed in Supplementary Figure 2. First, we assessed the microbial function annotated by the KEGG database. We totally annotated the genes expressed by the microbiota to 5 pathways at Level 1, 29 pathways at Level 2, 202 pathways at Level 3, and 6935 KEGG orthology (Supplementary Fig. 3). We next focused on all metabolic pathways of Level 3 and employed STAMP to identify 11 differential pathways between group TD and group C (\nIn group C, tryptophan metabolism, biotin metabolism, histidine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids were downregulated, while lysine biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis were upregulated (\nFurthermore, we employed partial correlation analysis to investigate relationships between three domains of ADHD symptoms and KEGG pathways, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, SPM, site, and dietary variables. Results demonstrated that biotin metabolism showed negative correlations with all three symptoms, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis displayed positive correlations with all symptoms (\nSimilarly, pathways demonstrating consistent results in both comparative analysis and correlation analysis were considered more robust. The biotin metabolism pathway showed increased abundance in group TD in all three pairs of comparisons, and correlation analysis also demonstrated that this pathway was negatively correlated with all three ADHD symptoms. The relative abundance of tryptophan metabolism was downregulated in group IA and group C and the pathway also showed a negative correlation with inattention symptoms. The relative abundance of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis was upregulated in group HA and group C, and the pathway also showed a positive correlation with impulsivity symptoms. In addition, group C, which exhibited symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, demonstrated differences in biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid metabolism, and histidine metabolism. Correspondingly, correlation analysis revealed that the first two pathways were associated with inattention, while histidine metabolism was associated with impulsivity.\nTo further elucidate the alterations in bacterial metabolism, we conducted untargeted metabolomics using fecal samples. The baseline comparison results between metabolomic subgroups and the full cohort are provided in Supplementary Table 7. No significant differences were observed in all these key variables, which supported the representativeness of the metabolomic subgroups. A total of 307 metabolites were identified, with classifications and the number of each class presented in Supplementary Figure 4. The comprehensive details of each identified metabolite are presented in Supplementary Table 8.\nBased on the differential metabolite screening criteria, there were 21 downregulated metabolites identified in group ADHD compared to group TD (\n(A) Volcano plot of the different metabolites between group ADHD and group TD.

After adjusting various confounding factors, we found that inattention symptom was negatively correlated with 12-hydroxystearic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid, lithocholic acid acetate methyl ester, vanillin, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, imidazoleacetic acid, 12-tridecanoic acid, and taurochendeoxycholic acid. Hyperactivity symptom was negatively correlated with 12-hydroxystearic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid, lithocholic acid acetate methyl ester, linoleic acid, 3,6-diketocholanic acid ethyl ester, and quinolinic acid. Impulsivity symptoms also had a negative correlation with vanillin, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, quinolinic acid, and ricinoleic acid (\nTo further explore the association between metagenomics and metabolomics between groups, we used the MIMOSA model to predict the impact of gut microbiota composition or function on metabolite concentrations. Based on the metabolic network approach, we then identified eight metabolites regulated by gut microbiome functions, which were annotated by KEGG orthology, including 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid, imidazoleacetic acid, hydroxyproline, 4-aminobutyric acid, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, L-asparagine, D-xylose, and pidolic acid. Importantly, imidazoleacetic acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, and 4-guanidinobutyric acid were previously identified as key differential metabolites between group ADHD and group TD, and all three are classified as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). It is noteworthy that the top producing pathways of these three metabolites are\nResults of MIMOSA model to predict the impact of gut microbiota composition or function on metabolite concentrations.\nID: KEGG compound ID for that metabolite; R\nTo investigate the influence and interactions of microbiota and metabolites on ADHD, we selected differential species and metabolites most strongly correlated with ADHD symptoms. The causal mediation analysis indicated a total effect of\nTo verify the pathway from microbiota to metabolites and subsequently to ADHD symptoms, we conducted a fecal microbiota transplantation experiment in mice. Detailed information on the sequencing data of mice fecal samples was presented in Supplementary Table 12. The 16S rRNA analysis of mice fecal microbiota showed a significant reduction in alpha diversity following treatment with ABX. In terms of beta diversity, the microbiota of ABX-treated mice exhibited a distinct distribution pattern compared to wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 7). These findings validated the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in altering the gut microbiota. After fecal microbiota transplantation from different sources, we observed that mice subjected to feces from ADHD patients with a low abundance of beneficial bacteria in group FMT-A exhibited hyperactive behavior (\nIn the rescue experiments for mice exhibiting ADHD-related symptoms after receiving FMT from ADHD patients, we found that compared to the control group (FMT-A-C), group FMT-A-R1, which received treatment with\n(A) workflow diagram of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and rescue experiments in mice.

While comparing gut microbiota taxa between ADHD subgroups and group TD, there were no significant differences observed in alpha diversity between patients with ADHD and TDs, which aligns with several previous studies.\nTo explore the relationship between taxa and ADHD symptoms, we employed LEfSe analysis between ADHD subgroups exhibiting different domains of symptoms and group TD, as well as correlation analysis between symptoms and microbiota. Microbial features that exhibited consistent results were deemed more robust. The LEfSe analysis of the ADHD subgroups and group TD revealed that the family\nRegarding the harmful bacteria enriched in ADHD groups or positively correlated with ADHD symptoms, both methods identified\nThe analysis of predicted microbial functions revealed significant differences between ADHD subgroups and group TD. The most significant pathways include several amino acid-related pathways, such as tryptophan metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and lysine biosynthesis. As Li et al. reported, gut microbiota actively reshapes the host’s amino acid balance through the metabolism of intestinal amino acids.\nOur analysis of metagenomic functional pathways and fecal metabolites concurrently revealed a downregulation of both fatty acid metabolism and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in ADHD. The most significantly enriched process was the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids, including MUFAs,\nIn addition, through the correlation analysis of metabolomics and metagenomics, we identified eight metabolites regulated by gut microbiota functions, three of which (imidazoleacetic acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, and 4-guanidinobutyric acid) also exhibited significant differences between groups. The three metabolites are categorized as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and we have also identified several key enzymes that contribute significantly to their synthesis. This suggests that the impact of gut microbiota on ADHD pathogenesis may be mediated through the synthesis of SCFAs by regulating the expression of certain enzymes. Consistent with our findings, in previous studies, aberrant levels of SCFAs have been implicated in disease pathogenesis and are generally present in diminished quantities.\nIn summary, in the analysis of linear discriminant analysis and symptom-related species from metagenomics, we identified probiotics primarily responsible for the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This aligns with the findings from the association analysis between metagenomics and metabolomics, where the metabolites modulated by gut microbiota and significantly downregulated in cases were primarily SCFAs. Additionally, the important overlapped pathways in the metagenomic differential functional pathways and the differential metabolites enrichment analysis were fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, with SCFAs being one of the key substances involved in these pathways. These findings collectively reveal a disturbance in fatty acid metabolism associated with the pathogenesis of ADHD. To further validate the hypothesis that SCFA-producing microbes affect ADHD pathogenesis through the mediation of SCFAs, we conducted a causal mediation analysis. The results confirmed that\nThe main strengths of our study include a larger sample size of the Chinese population compared to previous studies. At the same time, we excluded participants with other psychiatric, neurological, gastrointestinal, and metabolic conditions, as well as those with active use of psychoactive drugs, antibiotics, and probiotics. Methodologically, we employed shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which offers greater species identification depth compared to 16S rRNA sequencing. In terms of analysis, we conducted subgroup analyses of ADHD clinical symptoms, and the comparison between group C and group TD provided more comprehensive and detailed information that may have been overlooked without the application of subgroup analysis. Regarding study content, previous research has mostly focused on measuring plasma concentrations of amino acids and fatty acids as well as analyzing their correlation with clinical symptoms. In contrast, our study, for the first time, investigates the pathogenic role of gut microbiota in ADHD through species variations, gene pathway expression and fecal-targeted metabolomics. Specifically, it reveals the involvement of gut microbiota in disrupted fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, particularly in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, we formulated a hypothesis that gut microbiota affects ADHD symptoms through metabolic variations. We then subsequently conducted fecal microbiota transplantation experiment in mice to validate the hypothesis. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying metabolic disturbances in ADHD and addresses gaps in previous studies by linking the gut-brain axis mechanism to ADHD through gut microbiota profiles.\nThere are also some limitations to our study. First, excluding patients with gastrointestinal conditions or special diets may preclude participants with more aberrant microbiota compositions, thereby hindering the detection of correlations between gastrointestinal symptoms, food style, and microbial profiles. Second, due to the lower prevalence of the hyperactive/impulsive subtype in clinical settings, the sample size of group HA in our cohort might have been underpowered, and the sample size for each subgroup might be imbalanced. To address this problem, we emphasize the convergent evidence from our correlation analysis between microbial taxa, functions, and symptoms, which partially mitigates subgroup limitations. Third, we performed a cross-sectional study, which does not allow for confirming the causal directions between the correlational link between differential species, functional pathways, fecal metabolites, and the disease or symptoms. To address this problem, we conducted animal experiments; however, further longitudinal work in human populations should be undertaken to assess age-associated and other variations in gut microbiota.\nBuilding upon our findings and the current progress of gut-brain axis research, large-scale prospective longitudinal studies are essential to track the dynamic development of the gut microbiome and its relationship with the onset, progression, and symptom fluctuation of ADHD. In parallel, well-designed randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of dietary modifications, specific prebiotics, probiotics, or microbiota transplantation are warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting microbial and metabolic dysbiosis in ADHD. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations into how gut microbes and their metabolites influence gut-brain signaling pathways, along with integrative multi-omics approaches encompassing host genetics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, will be crucial for advancing our understanding of the complex biological underpinnings of ADHD and identifying novel therapeutic targets.\nIn conclusion, our study characterized the distinct gut microbiota and fetal metabolite profiles in patients with ADHD and its subtypes. We observed more gut microbial alterations in patients from group C compared to those in group IA or HA. Moreover, we employed metagenomics and fecal metabolomics techniques for the first time to elucidate the role of gut microbiota in the dysregulation of fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, with a particular focus on the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and SCFAs. Through causal mediation analysis of population sample data and mouse experiments of fecal microbiota transplantation, we further validated the pathway from microbiota to metabolites and subsequently to ADHD symptoms. The study provides new evidence supporting the association between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and ADHD and contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying these metabolic disturbances in ADHD.", "content_for_embedding": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric conditions in children and adolescents, with a global prevalence of 3–5%.\nAlthough ADHD is highly heritable,\nThrough the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), the effects of the gut microbiota on neurodevelopment have gained more recognition recently.

Using Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) of the R package mixOmics\nTo further investigate the correlation between gut microbiota function and fecal metabolites, we employed the MIMOSA model from the R package MIMOSA2.\nThe causal mediation analysis was conducted to explore the influence and interactions of microbiota and metabolites, using the ‘mediate’ function in the R package mediation.\nA total of 188 children and adolescents, consisting of 94 patients with ADHD (56 ADHD-I, 29 ADHD-C, 9 ADHD-HI) and 94 TDs, were recruited.\nDemographics, intelligence, and clinical symptoms of ADHD subgroup and typically developing controls (TD) in the study cohort.\nBMI, body mass index; SPM, Raven’s Standard Progress Matrice;\nWe carried out shotgun metagenomic sequencing for all participants and obtained an average of 9,973,835,522 clean bases per sample. Detailed information on gut microbiota sequencing data was given in Supplementary Table 3. We employed species rarefaction curves to assess and predict the degree to which species richness in the community increases with sample size. The curve for groups TD, IA, and C exhibited a flat trajectory during the terminal phases, indicating that the sample sizes were adequate and the subsequent analyses were reasonable (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nIn terms of taxonomic diversity, we first compared the top 10 relative abundances of microbiota at the level of genus, the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio), alpha diversity, and beta diversity between ADHD subgroups and TDs. The relative abundance of the top 10 genera of microbiota (Phocaeicola, Bacteroides, Alistipes, Parabacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Bifidobacterium, Escherichia, Lachnospira, Megamonas, and others) did not differ significantly (pFDR >0.05;\nThe overview of the microbiome profiles in three ADHD presentations and TD.

S.obs (observed species) were used to estimate the indexes of the total number of species in the community. Shannon index, Simpson index, and Pielou’s evenness index were used to measure the microbial diversity in the sample. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) whole tree was the diversity index calculated the distance of the evolutionary tree.\nThe significance tests of the community structure with greater between-group difference than the within-group difference.\nAnosim similarity analysis is a non-parametric test to test whether the between-group difference is significantly greater than the difference within the group to judge whether the grouping is meaningful. MRPP analysis is similar to Anosim analysis, but the ordering method is different. It analyzes whether the microbial community structure difference between groups is significant. Adonis tests the differences between groups by partitioning the distance matrix among sources of variation and using a permutation test to assess the significance of these differences.\nFurthermore, we used constrained ordination analysis to investigate the correlation between the microbial community structure and ADHD symptoms in all participants. To identify the optimal distribution of our data model (either a linear, unimodal, or bimodal distribution), we implemented a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). The length value indicated that the linear model fitted our data, with the first axis (DCA1) having a length of 2.58 (less than 3) (Supplementary Table 4). We applied the redundancy analysis (RDA) to a linear model. We found that at the species level, Component 1 from the RDA explained 57.98% of the variance (22.88% with Component 2 scaling) (ANOVA like permutation test F = 1.345, pFDR = 0.015,\nThe ANOVA like permutation test of the redundancy analysis (RDA) between the microbial community structure and ADHD symptoms.\nRDA1 and RDA2 represent the proportion of species distribution explained by each axis in the analysis.

Species\nAfter gene prediction, the total number of genes we obtained and the distribution of genes with different lengths were displayed in Supplementary Figure 2. First, we assessed the microbial function annotated by the KEGG database. We totally annotated the genes expressed by the microbiota to 5 pathways at Level 1, 29 pathways at Level 2, 202 pathways at Level 3, and 6935 KEGG orthology (Supplementary Fig. 3). We next focused on all metabolic pathways of Level 3 and employed STAMP to identify 11 differential pathways between group TD and group C (\nIn group C, tryptophan metabolism, biotin metabolism, histidine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids were downregulated, while lysine biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis were upregulated (\nFurthermore, we employed partial correlation analysis to investigate relationships between three domains of ADHD symptoms and KEGG pathways, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, SPM, site, and dietary variables. Results demonstrated that biotin metabolism showed negative correlations with all three symptoms, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis displayed positive correlations with all symptoms (\nSimilarly, pathways demonstrating consistent results in both comparative analysis and correlation analysis were considered more robust. The biotin metabolism pathway showed increased abundance in group TD in all three pairs of comparisons, and correlation analysis also demonstrated that this pathway was negatively correlated with all three ADHD symptoms. The relative abundance of tryptophan metabolism was downregulated in group IA and group C and the pathway also showed a negative correlation with inattention symptoms. The relative abundance of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis was upregulated in group HA and group C, and the pathway also showed a positive correlation with impulsivity symptoms. In addition, group C, which exhibited symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, demonstrated differences in biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid metabolism, and histidine metabolism. Correspondingly, correlation analysis revealed that the first two pathways were associated with inattention, while histidine metabolism was associated with impulsivity.\nTo further elucidate the alterations in bacterial metabolism, we conducted untargeted metabolomics using fecal samples. The baseline comparison results between metabolomic subgroups and the full cohort are provided in Supplementary Table 7. No significant differences were observed in all these key variables, which supported the representativeness of the metabolomic subgroups. A total of 307 metabolites were identified, with classifications and the number of each class presented in Supplementary Figure 4. The comprehensive details of each identified metabolite are presented in Supplementary Table 8.\nBased on the differential metabolite screening criteria, there were 21 downregulated metabolites identified in group ADHD compared to group TD (\n(A) Volcano plot of the different metabolites between group ADHD and group TD.

After adjusting various confounding factors, we found that inattention symptom was negatively correlated with 12-hydroxystearic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid, lithocholic acid acetate methyl ester, vanillin, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, imidazoleacetic acid, 12-tridecanoic acid, and taurochendeoxycholic acid. Hyperactivity symptom was negatively correlated with 12-hydroxystearic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid, lithocholic acid acetate methyl ester, linoleic acid, 3,6-diketocholanic acid ethyl ester, and quinolinic acid. Impulsivity symptoms also had a negative correlation with vanillin, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, quinolinic acid, and ricinoleic acid (\nTo further explore the association between metagenomics and metabolomics between groups, we used the MIMOSA model to predict the impact of gut microbiota composition or function on metabolite concentrations. Based on the metabolic network approach, we then identified eight metabolites regulated by gut microbiome functions, which were annotated by KEGG orthology, including 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid, imidazoleacetic acid, hydroxyproline, 4-aminobutyric acid, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, L-asparagine, D-xylose, and pidolic acid. Importantly, imidazoleacetic acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, and 4-guanidinobutyric acid were previously identified as key differential metabolites between group ADHD and group TD, and all three are classified as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). It is noteworthy that the top producing pathways of these three metabolites are\nResults of MIMOSA model to predict the impact of gut microbiota composition or function on metabolite concentrations.\nID: KEGG compound ID for that metabolite; R\nTo investigate the influence and interactions of microbiota and metabolites on ADHD, we selected differential species and metabolites most strongly correlated with ADHD symptoms. The causal mediation analysis indicated a total effect of\nTo verify the pathway from microbiota to metabolites and subsequently to ADHD symptoms, we conducted a fecal microbiota transplantation experiment in mice. Detailed information on the sequencing data of mice fecal samples was presented in Supplementary Table 12. The 16S rRNA analysis of mice fecal microbiota showed a significant reduction in alpha diversity following treatment with ABX. In terms of beta diversity, the microbiota of ABX-treated mice exhibited a distinct distribution pattern compared to wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 7). These findings validated the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in altering the gut microbiota. After fecal microbiota transplantation from different sources, we observed that mice subjected to feces from ADHD patients with a low abundance of beneficial bacteria in group FMT-A exhibited hyperactive behavior (\nIn the rescue experiments for mice exhibiting ADHD-related symptoms after receiving FMT from ADHD patients, we found that compared to the control group (FMT-A-C), group FMT-A-R1, which received treatment with\n(A) workflow diagram of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and rescue experiments in mice.

While comparing gut microbiota taxa between ADHD subgroups and group TD, there were no significant differences observed in alpha diversity between patients with ADHD and TDs, which aligns with several previous studies.\nTo explore the relationship between taxa and ADHD symptoms, we employed LEfSe analysis between ADHD subgroups exhibiting different domains of symptoms and group TD, as well as correlation analysis between symptoms and microbiota. Microbial features that exhibited consistent results were deemed more robust. The LEfSe analysis of the ADHD subgroups and group TD revealed that the family\nRegarding the harmful bacteria enriched in ADHD groups or positively correlated with ADHD symptoms, both methods identified\nThe analysis of predicted microbial functions revealed significant differences between ADHD subgroups and group TD. The most significant pathways include several amino acid-related pathways, such as tryptophan metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and lysine biosynthesis. As Li et al. reported, gut microbiota actively reshapes the host’s amino acid balance through the metabolism of intestinal amino acids.\nOur analysis of metagenomic functional pathways and fecal metabolites concurrently revealed a downregulation of both fatty acid metabolism and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in ADHD. The most significantly enriched process was the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids, including MUFAs,\nIn addition, through the correlation analysis of metabolomics and metagenomics, we identified eight metabolites regulated by gut microbiota functions, three of which (imidazoleacetic acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, and 4-guanidinobutyric acid) also exhibited significant differences between groups. The three metabolites are categorized as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and we have also identified several key enzymes that contribute significantly to their synthesis. This suggests that the impact of gut microbiota on ADHD pathogenesis may be mediated through the synthesis of SCFAs by regulating the expression of certain enzymes. Consistent with our findings, in previous studies, aberrant levels of SCFAs have been implicated in disease pathogenesis and are generally present in diminished quantities.\nIn summary, in the analysis of linear discriminant analysis and symptom-related species from metagenomics, we identified probiotics primarily responsible for the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This aligns with the findings from the association analysis between metagenomics and metabolomics, where the metabolites modulated by gut microbiota and significantly downregulated in cases were primarily SCFAs. Additionally, the important overlapped pathways in the metagenomic differential functional pathways and the differential metabolites enrichment analysis were fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, with SCFAs being one of the key substances involved in these pathways. These findings collectively reveal a disturbance in fatty acid metabolism associated with the pathogenesis of ADHD. To further validate the hypothesis that SCFA-producing microbes affect ADHD pathogenesis through the mediation of SCFAs, we conducted a causal mediation analysis. The results confirmed that\nThe main strengths of our study include a larger sample size of the Chinese population compared to previous studies. At the same time, we excluded participants with other psychiatric, neurological, gastrointestinal, and metabolic conditions, as well as those with active use of psychoactive drugs, antibiotics, and probiotics. Methodologically, we employed shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which offers greater species identification depth compared to 16S rRNA sequencing. In terms of analysis, we conducted subgroup analyses of ADHD clinical symptoms, and the comparison between group C and group TD provided more comprehensive and detailed information that may have been overlooked without the application of subgroup analysis. Regarding study content, previous research has mostly focused on measuring plasma concentrations of amino acids and fatty acids as well as analyzing their correlation with clinical symptoms. In contrast, our study, for the first time, investigates the pathogenic role of gut microbiota in ADHD through species variations, gene pathway expression and fecal-targeted metabolomics. Specifically, it reveals the involvement of gut microbiota in disrupted fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, particularly in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, we formulated a hypothesis that gut microbiota affects ADHD symptoms through metabolic variations. We then subsequently conducted fecal microbiota transplantation experiment in mice to validate the hypothesis. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying metabolic disturbances in ADHD and addresses gaps in previous studies by linking the gut-brain axis mechanism to ADHD through gut microbiota profiles.\nThere are also some limitations to our study. First, excluding patients with gastrointestinal conditions or special diets may preclude participants with more aberrant microbiota compositions, thereby hindering the detection of correlations between gastrointestinal symptoms, food style, and microbial profiles. Second, due to the lower prevalence of the hyperactive/impulsive subtype in clinical settings, the sample size of group HA in our cohort might have been underpowered, and the sample size for each subgroup might be imbalanced. To address this problem, we emphasize the convergent evidence from our correlation analysis between microbial taxa, functions, and symptoms, which partially mitigates subgroup limitations. Third, we performed a cross-sectional study, which does not allow for confirming the causal directions between the correlational link between differential species, functional pathways, fecal metabolites, and the disease or symptoms. To address this problem, we conducted animal experiments; however, further longitudinal work in human populations should be undertaken to assess age-associated and other variations in gut microbiota.\nBuilding upon our findings and the current progress of gut-brain axis research, large-scale prospective longitudinal studies are essential to track the dynamic development of the gut microbiome and its relationship with the onset, progression, and symptom fluctuation of ADHD. In parallel, well-designed randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of dietary modifications, specific prebiotics, probiotics, or microbiota transplantation are warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting microbial and metabolic dysbiosis in ADHD. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations into how gut microbes and their metabolites influence gut-brain signaling pathways, along with integrative multi-omics approaches encompassing host genetics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, will be crucial for advancing our understanding of the complex biological underpinnings of ADHD and identifying novel therapeutic targets.\nIn conclusion, our study characterized the distinct gut microbiota and fetal metabolite profiles in patients with ADHD and its subtypes. We observed more gut microbial alterations in patients from group C compared to those in group IA or HA. Moreover, we employed metagenomics and fecal metabolomics techniques for the first time to elucidate the role of gut microbiota in the dysregulation of fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, with a particular focus on the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and SCFAs. Through causal mediation analysis of population sample data and mouse experiments of fecal microbiota transplantation, we further validated the pathway from microbiota to metabolites and subsequently to ADHD symptoms. The study provides new evidence supporting the association between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and ADHD and contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying these metabolic disturbances in ADHD.", "topic": "Neurotransmitter"}

It was considered an intervention when the benefits of a rapid delivery for the mother or fetus outweighed the risks of continuing the pregnancy (\nThis was a randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to assess the effects of dexamethasone on labor induction in pregnant women. The trial was conducted at Besat Hospital in Sanandaj, Iran. It adhered to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for reporting randomized controlled trials (\nThe study included pregnant women who were ≥18 years, with a singleton pregnancy, gestational age of 37 weeks, primigravida status, and cephalic presentation of the fetus. Women were excluded from participation if they had multiple pregnancies, non-cephalic fetal position, cephalopelvic disproportion, premature rupture of membranes, macrosomia, history of uterine surgery or anomalies, placenta previa, active genital herpes, intrauterine growth restriction, oligohydramnios, or fetal distress, which was determined based on abnormal non-stress test (NST) findings, Doppler velocimetry abnormalities, or persistent fetal heart rate decelerations. Other complications that could interfere with the trial outcomes were also considered exclusion criteria.\nThe sample size calculation was based on a clinical superiority trial design. Based on a meta-analysis by Salman et al (2017) (\n-Intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone (First group)\n-Intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone (Second group)\n-Control group in the active phase (Third group)\n-Control group in the latent phase (Fourth group)\nParticipants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups using a balanced block randomization method to ensure equal distribution and minimize baseline differences in maternal age, BMI, gestational age, and fetal sex. Randomization was carried out using randomization.com, with a fixed block size of 8 to maintain group balance and minimize selection bias. This ensured an equal distribution of participants across the 4 groups in a predictable but concealed manner. An independent statistician generated the sequence to eliminate selection bias. To ensure allocation concealment, the sequence was securely stored in sealed, opaque, and sequentially numbered envelopes. These envelopes were only accessible to the study coordinator at the time of participant enrollment, ensuring that group assignments remained unpredictable until allocation.\nParticipants in the control group received normal saline as a single 8 mL intravenous bolus along with standard labor induction medications. The standard medications included misoprostol (50 µg every 3 to 6 hours orally) to facilitate cervical ripening and oxytocin infusion, which was administered as needed to stimulate uterine contractions. These treatments ensured the initiation and progression of labor in the control group.\nIn contrast, participants in the intervention groups received dexamethasone (8 mg IV) along with the standard labor induction medications. Dexamethasone was administered to evaluate its potential role in enhancing the labor induction process. The combination of dexamethasone with misoprostol and oxytocin was tested to assess any additional benefits in reducing the time to delivery and improving maternal and neonatal outcomes.\nThe primary outcome was the time to delivery, measured from the initiation of labor induction to the birth of the infant. This outcome was chosen to evaluate the efficiency of labor induction in response to dexamethasone treatment compared to the control group, providing key insights into whether dexamethasone could reduce the duration of labor.\nSecondary outcomes included maternal side effects, such as hypertension, tachycardia, and nausea, which were monitored throughout the study to assess any adverse reactions to the treatments. Neonatal outcomes were evaluated, including APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes, birth weight, and the need for neonatal resuscitation. These secondary outcomes aimed to assess the impact of dexamethasone on neonatal health, including whether it influenced the immediate well-being of the newborn after delivery.\nAt the time of enrollment, baseline demographic and clinical data were collected, including maternal age, BMI, gestational age, and fetal sex. Clinical assessments were carried out to monitor FHR through a nonstress test, uterine contractions, and regular vaginal examinations to assess cervical dilation. There were no changes to the original data collection plan during the trial.\nData analysis was performed using Stata Version 18. Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation (SD), and frequency, were used to summarize the baseline characteristics and outcomes of the study. Continuous variables, such as age, BMI, gestational age, birth weight, and labor phase durations, were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Variables that followed a normal distribution were compared between groups using 1-way analysis of variance, while those that did not follow a normal distribution were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical variables, such as sex distribution and delivery type, were compared using the chi-square test. The Fisher exact test was applied where expected frequencies were small. For comparison of the baseline Bishop score, which differed significantly between groups, post-hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted using the Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparisons. The effect of dexamethasone on labor progression and neonatal outcomes was assessed by comparing mean differences between groups using independent t tests for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed data. Effect sizes for significant differences were reported using Cohen's d for continuous variables. For comparing labor durations, cervical dilation rates, and secondary pregnancy times between groups, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the precision of the mean differences. The significance level for all statistical tests in this study was set at 0.05.\nThe study included a total of 120 participants (\nThe active phase groups—intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone and control group in the active phase—demonstrated efficient labor progression, with some notable differences. The intervention group in the active phase, receiving dexamethasone group had a normal vaginal delivery (NVD) rate of 96.67% (29/30) and a caesarian section (C/S) rate of 3.33% (1/30), while the control group in the active phase achieved a perfect 100% NVD rate (30/30) and no C/S deliveries (0/30). Both groups showed a high proportion of the rupture of membranes (ROM) in the active phase, with the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone at 93.23% (28/30) and the control group in the active phase at 93.33% (28/30), indicating similar timing of ROM. The intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone, however, benefited from dexamethasone, exhibiting a significantly shorter latent-to-active phase duration (mean, 4.85 hours), active phase duration (mean 2.20 hours), and total time to delivery (mean 7.21 hours), along with a rapid cervical dilation rate (2.57 cm/hour). Specific duration and dilation data for the control group in the active phase group are not provided, but its 100% NVD rate suggests robust labor progression without intervention, potentially comparable to or slightly slower than the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone, given the absence of dexamethasone acceleration. No neonates from either group required neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, reflecting favorable outcomes in both (\nNext, comparing the latent phase groups, the intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone had a lower NVD rate of 90% (27/30) and a higher C/S rate of 10% (3/30) compared to the control group in the latent phase group’s 93.33% NVD (28/30) and 6.67% C/S (2/30). ROM in the active phase was less frequent in both latent phase groups, with the intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone at 66.67% (20/30) and the control group in the latent phase at 70% (21/30) compared to the active phase groups. The intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone showed significantly longer labor durations, with a latent-to-active phase duration of 12.51 hours, active phase duration of 4.11 hours, and the total time to delivery of 17.20 hours, alongside a slower cervical dilation rate of 1.13 cm/hour. Specific duration and dilation data for the intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone are not provided, but its higher C/S rate and lower active phase ROM suggest slower progression than the control group in the latent phase, despite dexamethasone administration. No NICU admissions were reported in either latent phase group (\nWhen analyzing all 4 groups together, the intervention group in the active phase, receiving dexamethasone, stood out with the fastest labor progression. The control group in the active phase group followed with a 100% NVD rate and 93.33% active phase ROM, indicating strong performance without dexamethasone, though likely slower than the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone in duration metrics. The intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone, with a 90% NVD rate, 10% C/S rate, and 66.67% active phase ROM, appeared less efficient than both active phase groups and potentially the control group in the latent phase, despite intervention. The control group in the latent phase lagged furthest behind, with the longest durations (12.51 hours latent-to-active, 4.11 hours active phase, 17.20 hours total), slowest dilation rate (1.13 cm/hour), and a 93.33% NVD rate, with 70% active phase ROM. Statistical significance was evident for ROM timing across groups (P = 0.027) and the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone group versus the control group in the latent phase comparisons (P < 0.0001 for most metrics), highlighting dexamethasone’s pronounced effect in the active phase. No NICU admissions occurred across the 4 groups, suggesting safe outcomes regardless of labor duration (\nThe active phase groups—intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone and control group in the active phase—showed consistent neonatal outcomes. The intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone had APGAR scores of 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes, identical to the control group in the active phase, which also recorded 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. This uniformity suggests that dexamethasone administration in the active phase did not adversely affect neonatal well-being compared to the control group (\nAmong the latent phase groups—intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone and control group in the latent phase—neonatal outcomes were similarly stable. The intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone had APGAR scores of 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes, matching the control group in the latent phase, which also showed 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. This indicates no differential impact of dexamethasone in the latent phase on neonatal health relative to the control (\nAcross all 4 groups—intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone, intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone, control group in the active phase, and control group in the latent phase—APGAR scores were consistently 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes (\nThe active phase groups differed in their use of labor-inducing medications. The intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone required less oxytocin (mean, 10.66 units; SD, 6.39) compared to the control group in the active phase (mean, 12.33 units; SD, 5.68), and substantially fewer misoprostol doses (mean, 23.33; SD, 36.51) than the control group in the active phase (mean, 60; SD, 72.39). This suggests that dexamethasone in the active phase may reduce the need for additional induction agents compared to the control (\nAmong the latent phase groups, the intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone used less oxytocin (mean, 12.33 units; SD, 7.27) than the control group in the latent phase (mean, 15 units; SD, 6.82), and fewer misoprostol doses (mean, 41.66; SD, 41.69) compared to the control group in the latent phase (mean, 90.03; SD, 83.42). This indicates a similar trend of reduced medication reliance with dexamethasone in the latent phase versus the control (\nAcross all 4 groups, the control group in the latent phase had the highest oxytocin use (mean, 15 units; SD, 6.82) and misoprostol use (mean, 90.03; SD, 83.42), followed by the control group in the active phase (oxytocin: 12.33 units; SD, 5.68; misoprostol: 60; SD, 72.39). The intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone showed moderate use (oxytocin: 12.33 units; SD, 7.27; misoprostol: 41.66; SD, 41.69), while the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone had the lowest (oxytocin: 10.66 units; SD, 6.39; misoprostol: 23.33; SD, 36.51). The difference in misoprostol use was statistically significant (\nThe active phase groups showed minimal adverse complications. The intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone reported 1 case of vaginal bleeding (1/30; 3.33%), while the control group in the active phase had no instances of vaginal bleeding (0/30; 0%). Neither group experienced FHR deceleration (0/30; 0% for both), indicating that dexamethasone in the active phase may be associated with a low incidence of complications, limited to a single bleeding event, compared to none in the control group (\nAmong the latent phase groups, the intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone had a higher incidence of adverse complications, with 3 cases of FHR deceleration (3/30; 10%) and no vaginal bleeding (0/30; 0%). The control group in the latent phase reported 2 cases of FHR deceleration (2/30; 6.67%) and no vaginal bleeding (0/30; 0%). This suggests that the latent phase, particularly with dexamethasone, may be associated with a higher risk of FHR deceleration compared to the control, although vaginal bleeding was absent in both (\nIn terms of adverse events, the incidence of vaginal bleeding was low across all groups. Only 1 participant (0.83%) experienced vaginal bleeding during the study, and the highest incidence was seen in the intervention group in the active phase (3.33%). However, this was not statistically significant (\nThe analysis revealed significant differences between the groups in several key outcomes. The latency to active phase duration was significantly reduced in both intervention groups compared to the control group, with the active phase dexamethasone group showing a difference of –7.66 hours (95% CI: –11.13 to –4.19,\nCONSORT flow diagram\nMean differences in the duration of labor phases across groups with 95% confidence intervals\nC/S: Cesarean, NVD: Natural vaginal delivery, ROM: Rupture of Membranes, NICU: Neonatal intensive care unit\nFHR: Fetal heart rate\n*\nThis study was designed to evaluate the impact of different interventions on the progression of labor, as well as on maternal and neonatal outcomes. The findings indicate significant variations between the groups, with the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone demonstrating the most advantageous results in terms of labor duration, cervical dilation, and time to delivery. These outcomes carry substantial clinical implications for the optimization of labor induction protocols and the enhancement of maternal and neonatal care. By shortening the duration of labor, we can decrease the risk of maternal complications such as chorioamnionitis, which is more common with prolonged labor. This is particularly relevant in settings where there's a higher baseline risk of infection due to ruptured membranes. Additionally, the risk of uterine rupture, especially in women with previous cesarean sections, can be mitigated by the accelerated labor observed in the intervention group in the active phase, receiving dexamethasone. This not only enhances safety in labor management but also improves the overall birthing experience by reducing fatigue, pain, and psychological stress, which can have long-term benefits on maternal mental health after delivery. From a neonatal perspective, quicker progression to delivery might reduce fetal stress, potentially lowering the incidence of fetal distress and the need for operative interventions like cesarean sections (\nMohaghegh et al (2021) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials involving 1879 patients to evaluate the effects of dexamethasone on labor progression. Their findings indicated that dexamethasone administration significantly reduced the interval from labor induction to the active phase by approximately 70 minutes (MD: –1.17, 95% CI –1.37 to –1, P < 0.00001) (\nKashanian et al (2011) conducted a randomized study comparing intravenous dexamethasone (8 mg) to a control group in 100 women undergoing labor induction. Their findings demonstrated a significantly shorter interval from induction to the active phase in the dexamethasone group (2.87 ± 0.93 hours vs 3.80 ± 0.93 hours,\nThe notably reduced duration from the latent to the active phase of labor, along with a shorter active phase in the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone, suggests that the intervention effectively expedited labor. This observation aligns with previous research, which has emphasized the advantages of integrating corticosteroids with conventional labor induction methods to enhance cervical ripening and augment uterine contractility. The faster cervical dilation observed in the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone supports the use of corticosteroids to prepare the cervix for labor, potentially reducing the need for mechanical or other pharmacological interventions that carry their own risks. Moreover, the reduced time to delivery can be critical in scenarios where there are concerns about fetal well-being, allowing for prompt intervention if necessary (\nInterestingly, while the control group in the latent phase also demonstrated positive outcomes in some parameters, differences between this group and the intervention group receiving dexamethasone in the active phase were not statistically significant for several measures. This implies that the intervention in the control group in the latent phase might provide similar benefits in specific scenarios, although additional studies are needed to thoroughly assess its effectiveness and safety compared to the approach taken with the intervention group in the active phase, receiving dexamethasone. Importantly, the comparable maternal and neonatal safety outcomes, including APGAR scores and the absence of significant adverse effects, reinforce the safety profile of dexamethasone when used appropriately. Previous literature supports that corticosteroids do not significantly increase adverse outcomes when used judiciously (\nShabanian et al (2024) conducted a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing vaginal dexamethasone tablets with hyoscine in primigravid women undergoing labor induction. Their findings demonstrated that dexamethasone significantly improved the Bishop score and shortened the induction-to-delivery interval, supporting the role of corticosteroids in enhancing cervical ripening. Although their administration route (vaginal) differs from systemic approaches, the observed benefits align with previous findings (\nFrom a clinical standpoint, these findings suggest that dexamethasone could improve labor management by accelerating the transition from the latent to the active phase and reducing the duration of active labor. This may lead to more efficient hospital resource utilization and decreased maternal discomfort, fatigue, and stress associated with prolonged labor. In addition, dexamethasone appears to enhance maternal and neonatal safety by potentially reducing complications such as infection and uterine rupture, particularly in high-risk cases. Given these benefits, dexamethasone could be integrated into labor induction protocols, especially when rapid delivery is needed to ensure fetal well-being. However, larger multicenter trials are necessary to confirm these findings across diverse populations and to investigate any long-term maternal and neonatal effects. Until then, clinicians should consider dexamethasone as an adjunct in specific labor management scenarios, carefully weighing its benefits against the known corticosteroid profile.\nDespite its strengths, this study has limitations. While the sample size was adequate to detect significant differences in primary outcomes, it may not have been large enough to capture subtle variations in secondary outcomes. In addition, the single-center design may limit the generalizability of the findings to broader populations. Future research should involve larger, multicenter trials to validate these results and explore potential variations across different settings and demographics.\nThe findings from this study advocate for the potential inclusion of corticosteroids in labor induction protocols, particularly where acceleration of labor is beneficial. Clinically, this could mean fewer complications, better maternal comfort, and improved neonatal outcomes. Nevertheless, the necessity for broader, more comprehensive studies to address the limitations and explore long-term outcomes remains a priority. This will help in establishing more definitive guidelines for the use of such interventions in clinical practice.\nThe study adhered to ethical guidelines set by the Ethics Committee of Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran (IR.MUK.REC.1402.037).

Categorical variables, such as sex distribution and delivery type, were compared using the chi-square test. The Fisher exact test was applied where expected frequencies were small. For comparison of the baseline Bishop score, which differed significantly between groups, post-hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted using the Bonferroni correction to control for multiple comparisons. The effect of dexamethasone on labor progression and neonatal outcomes was assessed by comparing mean differences between groups using independent t tests for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed data. Effect sizes for significant differences were reported using Cohen's d for continuous variables. For comparing labor durations, cervical dilation rates, and secondary pregnancy times between groups, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the precision of the mean differences. The significance level for all statistical tests in this study was set at 0.05.\nThe study included a total of 120 participants (\nThe active phase groups—intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone and control group in the active phase—demonstrated efficient labor progression, with some notable differences. The intervention group in the active phase, receiving dexamethasone group had a normal vaginal delivery (NVD) rate of 96.67% (29/30) and a caesarian section (C/S) rate of 3.33% (1/30), while the control group in the active phase achieved a perfect 100% NVD rate (30/30) and no C/S deliveries (0/30). Both groups showed a high proportion of the rupture of membranes (ROM) in the active phase, with the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone at 93.23% (28/30) and the control group in the active phase at 93.33% (28/30), indicating similar timing of ROM. The intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone, however, benefited from dexamethasone, exhibiting a significantly shorter latent-to-active phase duration (mean, 4.85 hours), active phase duration (mean 2.20 hours), and total time to delivery (mean 7.21 hours), along with a rapid cervical dilation rate (2.57 cm/hour). Specific duration and dilation data for the control group in the active phase group are not provided, but its 100% NVD rate suggests robust labor progression without intervention, potentially comparable to or slightly slower than the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone, given the absence of dexamethasone acceleration. No neonates from either group required neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, reflecting favorable outcomes in both (\nNext, comparing the latent phase groups, the intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone had a lower NVD rate of 90% (27/30) and a higher C/S rate of 10% (3/30) compared to the control group in the latent phase group’s 93.33% NVD (28/30) and 6.67% C/S (2/30). ROM in the active phase was less frequent in both latent phase groups, with the intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone at 66.67% (20/30) and the control group in the latent phase at 70% (21/30) compared to the active phase groups. The intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone showed significantly longer labor durations, with a latent-to-active phase duration of 12.51 hours, active phase duration of 4.11 hours, and the total time to delivery of 17.20 hours, alongside a slower cervical dilation rate of 1.13 cm/hour. Specific duration and dilation data for the intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone are not provided, but its higher C/S rate and lower active phase ROM suggest slower progression than the control group in the latent phase, despite dexamethasone administration. No NICU admissions were reported in either latent phase group (\nWhen analyzing all 4 groups together, the intervention group in the active phase, receiving dexamethasone, stood out with the fastest labor progression. The control group in the active phase group followed with a 100% NVD rate and 93.33% active phase ROM, indicating strong performance without dexamethasone, though likely slower than the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone in duration metrics. The intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone, with a 90% NVD rate, 10% C/S rate, and 66.67% active phase ROM, appeared less efficient than both active phase groups and potentially the control group in the latent phase, despite intervention. The control group in the latent phase lagged furthest behind, with the longest durations (12.51 hours latent-to-active, 4.11 hours active phase, 17.20 hours total), slowest dilation rate (1.13 cm/hour), and a 93.33% NVD rate, with 70% active phase ROM. Statistical significance was evident for ROM timing across groups (P = 0.027) and the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone group versus the control group in the latent phase comparisons (P < 0.0001 for most metrics), highlighting dexamethasone’s pronounced effect in the active phase. No NICU admissions occurred across the 4 groups, suggesting safe outcomes regardless of labor duration (\nThe active phase groups—intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone and control group in the active phase—showed consistent neonatal outcomes. The intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone had APGAR scores of 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes, identical to the control group in the active phase, which also recorded 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. This uniformity suggests that dexamethasone administration in the active phase did not adversely affect neonatal well-being compared to the control group (\nAmong the latent phase groups—intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone and control group in the latent phase—neonatal outcomes were similarly stable. The intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone had APGAR scores of 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes, matching the control group in the latent phase, which also showed 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. This indicates no differential impact of dexamethasone in the latent phase on neonatal health relative to the control (\nAcross all 4 groups—intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone, intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone, control group in the active phase, and control group in the latent phase—APGAR scores were consistently 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes (\nThe active phase groups differed in their use of labor-inducing medications. The intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone required less oxytocin (mean, 10.66 units; SD, 6.39) compared to the control group in the active phase (mean, 12.33 units; SD, 5.68), and substantially fewer misoprostol doses (mean, 23.33; SD, 36.51) than the control group in the active phase (mean, 60; SD, 72.39). This suggests that dexamethasone in the active phase may reduce the need for additional induction agents compared to the control (\nAmong the latent phase groups, the intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone used less oxytocin (mean, 12.33 units; SD, 7.27) than the control group in the latent phase (mean, 15 units; SD, 6.82), and fewer misoprostol doses (mean, 41.66; SD, 41.69) compared to the control group in the latent phase (mean, 90.03; SD, 83.42). This indicates a similar trend of reduced medication reliance with dexamethasone in the latent phase versus the control (\nAcross all 4 groups, the control group in the latent phase had the highest oxytocin use (mean, 15 units; SD, 6.82) and misoprostol use (mean, 90.03; SD, 83.42), followed by the control group in the active phase (oxytocin: 12.33 units; SD, 5.68; misoprostol: 60; SD, 72.39). The intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone showed moderate use (oxytocin: 12.33 units; SD, 7.27; misoprostol: 41.66; SD, 41.69), while the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone had the lowest (oxytocin: 10.66 units; SD, 6.39; misoprostol: 23.33; SD, 36.51). The difference in misoprostol use was statistically significant (\nThe active phase groups showed minimal adverse complications. The intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone reported 1 case of vaginal bleeding (1/30; 3.33%), while the control group in the active phase had no instances of vaginal bleeding (0/30; 0%). Neither group experienced FHR deceleration (0/30; 0% for both), indicating that dexamethasone in the active phase may be associated with a low incidence of complications, limited to a single bleeding event, compared to none in the control group (\nAmong the latent phase groups, the intervention group in the latent phase receiving dexamethasone had a higher incidence of adverse complications, with 3 cases of FHR deceleration (3/30; 10%) and no vaginal bleeding (0/30; 0%). The control group in the latent phase reported 2 cases of FHR deceleration (2/30; 6.67%) and no vaginal bleeding (0/30; 0%). This suggests that the latent phase, particularly with dexamethasone, may be associated with a higher risk of FHR deceleration compared to the control, although vaginal bleeding was absent in both (\nIn terms of adverse events, the incidence of vaginal bleeding was low across all groups. Only 1 participant (0.83%) experienced vaginal bleeding during the study, and the highest incidence was seen in the intervention group in the active phase (3.33%). However, this was not statistically significant (\nThe analysis revealed significant differences between the groups in several key outcomes. The latency to active phase duration was significantly reduced in both intervention groups compared to the control group, with the active phase dexamethasone group showing a difference of –7.66 hours (95% CI: –11.13 to –4.19,\nCONSORT flow diagram\nMean differences in the duration of labor phases across groups with 95% confidence intervals\nC/S: Cesarean, NVD: Natural vaginal delivery, ROM: Rupture of Membranes, NICU: Neonatal intensive care unit\nFHR: Fetal heart rate\n*\nThis study was designed to evaluate the impact of different interventions on the progression of labor, as well as on maternal and neonatal outcomes. The findings indicate significant variations between the groups, with the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone demonstrating the most advantageous results in terms of labor duration, cervical dilation, and time to delivery. These outcomes carry substantial clinical implications for the optimization of labor induction protocols and the enhancement of maternal and neonatal care. By shortening the duration of labor, we can decrease the risk of maternal complications such as chorioamnionitis, which is more common with prolonged labor. This is particularly relevant in settings where there's a higher baseline risk of infection due to ruptured membranes. Additionally, the risk of uterine rupture, especially in women with previous cesarean sections, can be mitigated by the accelerated labor observed in the intervention group in the active phase, receiving dexamethasone. This not only enhances safety in labor management but also improves the overall birthing experience by reducing fatigue, pain, and psychological stress, which can have long-term benefits on maternal mental health after delivery. From a neonatal perspective, quicker progression to delivery might reduce fetal stress, potentially lowering the incidence of fetal distress and the need for operative interventions like cesarean sections (\nMohaghegh et al (2021) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials involving 1879 patients to evaluate the effects of dexamethasone on labor progression. Their findings indicated that dexamethasone administration significantly reduced the interval from labor induction to the active phase by approximately 70 minutes (MD: –1.17, 95% CI –1.37 to –1, P < 0.00001) (\nKashanian et al (2011) conducted a randomized study comparing intravenous dexamethasone (8 mg) to a control group in 100 women undergoing labor induction. Their findings demonstrated a significantly shorter interval from induction to the active phase in the dexamethasone group (2.87 ± 0.93 hours vs 3.80 ± 0.93 hours,\nThe notably reduced duration from the latent to the active phase of labor, along with a shorter active phase in the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone, suggests that the intervention effectively expedited labor. This observation aligns with previous research, which has emphasized the advantages of integrating corticosteroids with conventional labor induction methods to enhance cervical ripening and augment uterine contractility. The faster cervical dilation observed in the intervention group in the active phase receiving dexamethasone supports the use of corticosteroids to prepare the cervix for labor, potentially reducing the need for mechanical or other pharmacological interventions that carry their own risks. Moreover, the reduced time to delivery can be critical in scenarios where there are concerns about fetal well-being, allowing for prompt intervention if necessary (\nInterestingly, while the control group in the latent phase also demonstrated positive outcomes in some parameters, differences between this group and the intervention group receiving dexamethasone in the active phase were not statistically significant for several measures. This implies that the intervention in the control group in the latent phase might provide similar benefits in specific scenarios, although additional studies are needed to thoroughly assess its effectiveness and safety compared to the approach taken with the intervention group in the active phase, receiving dexamethasone. Importantly, the comparable maternal and neonatal safety outcomes, including APGAR scores and the absence of significant adverse effects, reinforce the safety profile of dexamethasone when used appropriately. Previous literature supports that corticosteroids do not significantly increase adverse outcomes when used judiciously (\nShabanian et al (2024) conducted a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing vaginal dexamethasone tablets with hyoscine in primigravid women undergoing labor induction. Their findings demonstrated that dexamethasone significantly improved the Bishop score and shortened the induction-to-delivery interval, supporting the role of corticosteroids in enhancing cervical ripening. Although their administration route (vaginal) differs from systemic approaches, the observed benefits align with previous findings (\nFrom a clinical standpoint, these findings suggest that dexamethasone could improve labor management by accelerating the transition from the latent to the active phase and reducing the duration of active labor. This may lead to more efficient hospital resource utilization and decreased maternal discomfort, fatigue, and stress associated with prolonged labor. In addition, dexamethasone appears to enhance maternal and neonatal safety by potentially reducing complications such as infection and uterine rupture, particularly in high-risk cases. Given these benefits, dexamethasone could be integrated into labor induction protocols, especially when rapid delivery is needed to ensure fetal well-being. However, larger multicenter trials are necessary to confirm these findings across diverse populations and to investigate any long-term maternal and neonatal effects. Until then, clinicians should consider dexamethasone as an adjunct in specific labor management scenarios, carefully weighing its benefits against the known corticosteroid profile.\nDespite its strengths, this study has limitations. While the sample size was adequate to detect significant differences in primary outcomes, it may not have been large enough to capture subtle variations in secondary outcomes. In addition, the single-center design may limit the generalizability of the findings to broader populations. Future research should involve larger, multicenter trials to validate these results and explore potential variations across different settings and demographics.\nThe findings from this study advocate for the potential inclusion of corticosteroids in labor induction protocols, particularly where acceleration of labor is beneficial. Clinically, this could mean fewer complications, better maternal comfort, and improved neonatal outcomes. Nevertheless, the necessity for broader, more comprehensive studies to address the limitations and explore long-term outcomes remains a priority. This will help in establishing more definitive guidelines for the use of such interventions in clinical practice.\nThe study adhered to ethical guidelines set by the Ethics Committee of Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran (IR.MUK.REC.1402.037).

For 5mC, there were 36 associations between six brain structure regions and 20 DMRs (Figure\nThis is the first parallel investigation of genome‐wide 5mC and 5hmC levels in cfDNA from individuals with SCZ. First, we identified 954 DMRs and 1474 DhMRs with distinct epigenetic modifications in individuals with SCZ compared with HCs; many DMRs and DhMRs were located in genes specifically expressed in brain tissues and enriched in neuronal functions. Second, GWAS enrichment analysis indicated that these DMR and DhMR genes were associated with both psychiatric and brain volume phenotypes. Additionally, colocalization analysis revealed that DMR and DhMR locations overlapped with GWAS‐identified genomic loci of SCZ. Finally, we observed associations between brain structure atrophy and altered DMRs and DhMRs, especially in the hippocampus. Together, these results indicated that cell‐free 5mC and 5hmC studies contribute to identifying potential SCZ signatures and understanding its pathogenesis.\nPrevious DNA methylation studies of SCZ were performed in postmortem brain tissue [\nMoreover, our brain structure correlation analysis further validated that these DMRs and DhMRs were associated with brain volume phenotypes, especially in the hippocampus. Many studies have demonstrated that SCZ‐related gene dysfunction is localized to hippocampal glutamatergic neurons [\nThere are several limitations in our study. The sample size of our cohort was relatively small, and the cell‐free signatures need to be validated in external independent cohorts. In addition, changes in 5mC and 5hmC may be influenced by the long‐term effects of drugs and disease course, and further research should focus on first‐episode drug‐naïve individuals with SCZ. Moreover, individuals with other psychotic diseases with overlapping clinical and neurobiological features, including bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, should also be included to identify SCZ‐specific signatures. Although we detected brain‐specific genes associated with cell‐free 5mC and 5hmC, the current deconvolution algorithms were designed for DNA methylation arrays or whole‐genome bisulfite sequencing; therefore, we did not use a deconvolution algorithm to estimate the contribution of different tissues, particularly brain tissue, to the levels of cell‐free 5mC and 5hmC in plasma.\nIn summary, in this study, we identified a panel of DMRs and DhMRs that showed potential for SCZ detection. The analysis of DMRs and DhMRs as well as brain structure provided multiple insights into SCZ pathogenesis. In future studies we will recruit larger cohorts to validate our results.\nIndividuals with SCZ were enrolled from the mental health clinic of West China Hospital of Sichuan University between December 2021 and October 2022. SCZ diagnoses were confirmed by an experienced psychiatrist using DSM‐5 criteria. All of the patients were taking antipsychotic medicine regularly as advised by their doctors. The disease duration was assessed through the Nottingham Onset Schedule [\nThe severity of psychiatric symptoms in individuals with SCZ was assessed using the PANSS [\nBlood was collected in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA) tubes. Plasma was separated within 2 h by centrifugation. cfDNA was extracted with a VAHTS Serum/Plasma Circulating DNA Kit and quantified by a Qubit fluorometer. For library construction, 10–30 ng of cfDNA was used, with adaptor ligation including spike‐in controls. The spike‐in control included three lambda DNA products: one unmodified and two modified with 5mC and 5hmC. Subsequently, cfDNA sequencing for 5mC and 5hmC was performed using the cfMeDIP‐seq and selective chemical labeling (hMe‐Seal) methods, as detailed in the previous study [\nThe cfDNA 5mC‐ and 5hmC‐captured libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (150 bp paired‐end runs). Low‐quality reads were filtered with Fastp [\nWe utilized a 500 bp sliding window with a 250 bp step to scan each autosomal chromosome and then calculated the 5mC or 5hmC read coverage in each window using bedtools with the “‐coverage” parameter. Windows overlapping with low average mappability scores (<0.9) and dark regions that included centromeres, telomeres, and DAC and Duke excluded regions from the UCSC Table Browser, were removed. The mappability score was calculated using the GEM mappability program with 150‐mer length on the hg19 reference genome. In addition, only windows with more than three counts in at least 10 samples across all HC and SCZ samples (nonlow coverage windows) were retained for subsequent differential analysis. To assess potential batch effects in our dataset, we employed t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t‐SNE), a dimensionality reduction technique particularly effective for visualizing high‐dimensional data. The analysis was conducted following these steps: The raw counts of genomic windows were initially transformed using the variance‐stabilizing transformation (VST) function provided by R package DESeq2, the transformation produces transformed data on the log2 scale, which has been normalized with respect to library size or other normalization factors, making the data more suitable for t‐SNE analysis.

First, unlike methylation patterns in only peripheral blood cells [\nStructural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), which is noninvasive, involves nonionizing radiation, has high soft tissue resolution and discrimination, and provides morphological information for human brain imaging in vivo. Numerous sMRI studies in individuals with SCZ have identified brain structural alterations in, affecting both cortical regions [\nOn this basis, we proposed three primary questions: (1) whether alterations in epigenetic modifications of cfDNA serve as potential objective signatures for SCZ; (2) whether these alterations can provide insights into SCZ pathogenesis; and (3) whether these alterations are associated with changes in brain structure. To address these questions, we first identified the different cell‐free 5mC and 5hmC modifications between individuals with SCZ and HC. Furthermore, we annotated the different epigenetic modifications to genes and then performed tissue and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Moreover, we conducted GWAS enrichment analysis and colocalization analysis to investigate whether different epigenetic modifications are associated with genetic variations linked to SCZ. Finally, we correlated different epigenetic modifications with brain structures measured by sMRI. We expect this study to provide a new strategy for identifying objective signatures for SCZ and for exploring the role of epigenetic modifications in SCZ development.\nIn this study, we included 66 SCZ patients and 77 matched HCs (Table\nDemographics summary of study subjects.\nThe table shows the main information for healthy control and individuals with SCZ.

Previous studies have used stimuli such as photographs, static images, or videos of faces, which do not fully capture the richness of facial expressions (\nIn line with this, our group developed a set of dynamic virtual faces (DVFs) representing the six basic emotions (i.e. happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise) and a neutral expression.

Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study.\nThis preliminary sample included 30 participants: 10 patients experiencing a clinical relapse of schizophrenia, 10 individuals with an acute manic episode of BD, and 10 HCs. A clinical assessment was conducted by senior psychiatrists, confirming that the patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) criteria for schizophrenia relapses and acute manic episodes. The severity of the symptoms necessitated hospitalization in the psychiatric ward for intensive treatment. When the experimental procedure was performed, patients were already undergoing pharmacological treatment, which likely contributed to a reduction in the psychopathological scale scores. All participants were recruited from the same socio-cultural area and matched in terms of age, sex, and educational level.

The assessment used both nonimmersive and immersive virtual reality settings with DVFs.\nAccording to our first hypothesis, FER in immersive virtual reality was equal to or better than that in nonimmersive reality across all groups. Specifically, HCs showed better performance in immersive virtual reality, consistent with a previous study in healthy volunteers indicating their higher accuracy in this setting (\nThe second hypothesis of this study was only partially supported by our results. In terms of overall emotion recognition, patients with schizophrenia showed less accurate FER than HCs in both nonimmersive and immersive settings. Conversely, patients with BD showed decreased FER accuracy compared to HCs only in the immersive setting. The latter requires significant cognitive resources, which can be challenging for patients in manic episodes due to heightened distractibility, sensory sensitivity, and impaired attentional control (\nInterestingly, in the immersive setting, patients with schizophrenia showed greater accuracy in recognizing disgust than those with BD, though this difference was not statistically significant. This may be due to the impaired ability to recognize disgust during manic episodes (\nDifferences between patients and HCs were particularly evident for some negative emotions, such as fear and anger, in both the nonimmersive and immersive virtual reality settings. This is consistent with previous studies using virtual dynamic stimuli in schizophrenia (\nThese deficits in FER represent a significant limitation for the functional recovery of patients in their social, work, and family environments (\nDespite being the first to investigate FER in two patient groups compared to HCs using both immersive and nonimmersive virtual realities, our results should be interpreted considering the limitations of this study. First, these preliminary findings were based on a small sample size, thus limiting their generalizability. Our sample size had a post hoc power of 0.80 to detect differences up to\nIn summary, HCs showed higher accuracy in FER in immersive virtual reality compared to nonimmersive reality, whereas patients showed similar accuracy in both settings (H1). Regarding the differences between groups, although patients demonstrated lower accuracy in identifying emotions than HCs in both settings, there were no significant differences between schizophrenia and BD (H2).

Previous studies have used stimuli such as photographs, static images, or videos of faces, which do not fully capture the richness of facial expressions (\nIn line with this, our group developed a set of dynamic virtual faces (DVFs) representing the six basic emotions (i.e. happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise) and a neutral expression. These DVFs can be presented in immersive and nonimmersive virtual reality settings (\nThe current study presents preliminary findings on the differences in FER accuracy between immersive and nonimmersive virtual reality settings among patients experiencing a relapse of schizophrenia, a manic phase of BD, and a group of HCs. Immersive virtual reality provides an environment with enhanced realism and ecological validity that closely mimics real-life social interactions, potentially improving engagement and motivation, which are critical for effective cognitive rehabilitation programs (\n1. Hypothesis 1 (H1): In all groups, FER accuracy in the immersive virtual reality setting will be equal to or better than that in the nonimmersive virtual reality setting.\n2. Hypothesis 2 (H2): Patients with schizophrenia will show lower FER accuracy than patients with BD and HCs. Participants with BD will demonstrate intermediate FER accuracy between schizophrenia and HCs groups.\nParticipants were recruited between July 2023 and April 2024 at the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain. The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre (CEIm No.: 23/034; approved on 18 January 2023). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study.\nThis preliminary sample included 30 participants: 10 patients experiencing a clinical relapse of schizophrenia, 10 individuals with an acute manic episode of BD, and 10 HCs. A clinical assessment was conducted by senior psychiatrists, confirming that the patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) criteria for schizophrenia relapses and acute manic episodes. The severity of the symptoms necessitated hospitalization in the psychiatric ward for intensive treatment. When the experimental procedure was performed, patients were already undergoing pharmacological treatment, which likely contributed to a reduction in the psychopathological scale scores. All participants were recruited from the same socio-cultural area and matched in terms of age, sex, and educational level. The diagnosis was made according to the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-5-TR.\nDuring a single session, 52 DVFs were presented to the participants in nonimmersive (via a computer monitor) and immersive (via fully immersive vision glasses) settings. The sequence of presentations alternated between the participants for nonimmersive and immersive virtual reality experiences. The software tool and the DVFs are publicly accessible at the Castilla-La Mancha University’s institutional repository, RUIdeRA (\nTo test our hypotheses, we evaluated the FER accuracy by measuring the percentage of correctly identified facial expressions (\nStatistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics software (version 27). Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and percentages, were used to analyze the quantitative and qualitative variables, respectively. Given the non-normal distribution of the data and the small size of the samples, nonparametric methods were predominantly utilized to test the hypotheses, with statistical significance set at a\nSociodemographic and clinical data of the participants are described in Table\nSociodemographic and clinical data\nData are expressed as mean ± SD or %.\nBD, bipolar disorder; CPZE, chlorpromazine equivalent dose; FG, first-generation antipsychotics; HC, healthy control; MADRS, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale; PANSS, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; SCZ, schizophrenia; SGA, second generation antipsychotics; YMRS, Young Mania Rating Scale.\nThe comparison of the FER accuracy scores between the nonimmersive and immersive virtual reality settings is detailed in Table\nDifferences in facial emotion recognition accuracy between immersive and nonimmersive virtual reality for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and healthy controls\nData are expressed as the mean percentage of correctly recognized facial emotions with standard deviations (mean ± SD).\nBD, bipolar disorder; HC, healthy controls; SCZ, schizophrenia.\nDone using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\nDone using the Kruskal–Wallis test.\nWithin the HCs group, we identified significant differences (\nThe FER accuracy scores among the three participant groups across both nonimmersive and immersive virtual reality experiences are detailed in Table\nGraphical radar chart showing the percentage of facial emotions recognized by the schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and healthy controls groups in (a) immersive and (b) nonimmersive virtual reality settings. Each line on the radar represents a percentage, with 10 lines ranging from 0% to 100%.\nA significant difference was observed in the overall emotion recognition scores among the three groups (\nWhen analyzing each emotion individually, differences in FER emerged among the three groups for fear (\nVariability in overall emotion recognition between the three groups was consistent with the findings observed for nonimmersive virtual reality (\nRegarding specific emotions, differences were observed for anger (\nAlthough the post hoc tests did not reach statistical significance, the Kruskal–Wallis test indicated significant group differences in joy (\nThis study investigated FER in 10 patients experiencing a clinical relapse of schizophrenia and 10 individuals with an acute manic episode compared to 10 HCs. The assessment used both nonimmersive and immersive virtual reality settings with DVFs.\nAccording to our first hypothesis, FER in immersive virtual reality was equal to or better than that in nonimmersive reality across all groups. Specifically, HCs showed better performance in immersive virtual reality, consistent with a previous study in healthy volunteers indicating their higher accuracy in this setting (\nThe second hypothesis of this study was only partially supported by our results. In terms of overall emotion recognition, patients with schizophrenia showed less accurate FER than HCs in both nonimmersive and immersive settings. Conversely, patients with BD showed decreased FER accuracy compared to HCs only in the immersive setting. The latter requires significant cognitive resources, which can be challenging for patients in manic episodes due to heightened distractibility, sensory sensitivity, and impaired attentional control (\nInterestingly, in the immersive setting, patients with schizophrenia showed greater accuracy in recognizing disgust than those with BD, though this difference was not statistically significant. This may be due to the impaired ability to recognize disgust during manic episodes (\nDifferences between patients and HCs were particularly evident for some negative emotions, such as fear and anger, in both the nonimmersive and immersive virtual reality settings. This is consistent with previous studies using virtual dynamic stimuli in schizophrenia (\nThese deficits in FER represent a significant limitation for the functional recovery of patients in their social, work, and family environments (\nDespite being the first to investigate FER in two patient groups compared to HCs using both immersive and nonimmersive virtual realities, our results should be interpreted considering the limitations of this study. First, these preliminary findings were based on a small sample size, thus limiting their generalizability. Our sample size had a post hoc power of 0.80 to detect differences up to\nIn summary, HCs showed higher accuracy in FER in immersive virtual reality compared to nonimmersive reality, whereas patients showed similar accuracy in both settings (H1). Regarding the differences between groups, although patients demonstrated lower accuracy in identifying emotions than HCs in both settings, there were no significant differences between schizophrenia and BD (H2). These conclusions are preliminary and should be interpreted cautiously because of the small sample size.\nThe present study was conducted within a project approved by the Ethics Committee of Clinical Research (CEIm No.: 23/034; approved on January 18, 2023) of the ‘Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre’, Madrid, Spain.\nM.S., A.F.-C., D.S.-R., and R.R.-J. designed the study.

While the primary focus in trauma care is on immediate life-threatening injuries, subtle myocardial impairment can develop due to direct cardiac contusion, systemic inflammation, neurohormonal dysregulation, and oxidative stress [\nAlthough the exact prevalence of subclinical myocardial dysfunction following trauma is underreported due to diagnostic limitations, data from intensive care settings suggest that approximately 25–30% of critically ill patients exhibit impaired myocardial strain despite preserved ejection fraction [\nLongitudinal myocardial deformation, assessed through speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE), has emerged as a promising tool in the evaluation of post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction. Unlike left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which reflects global ventricular function and may remain preserved in early myocardial impairment, global longitudinal strain (GLS) provides a more detailed and quantitative measure of myocardial contractility. GLS has been shown to detect subclinical myocardial dysfunction in various cardiac conditions, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cardiomyopathies, making it an ideal candidate for trauma-related myocardial assessment [\nGLS was selected for its superior sensitivity in detecting subclinical myocardial dysfunction compared to traditional measures such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), or cardiac biomarkers. Unlike LVEF, which often remains preserved in early myocardial injury, GLS can quantify subtle changes in myocardial fiber deformation before overt systolic dysfunction develops. Additionally, GLS is angle-independent, and reproducible, and can be measured via standard 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography, making it a feasible and non-invasive tool in the acute trauma setting.\nDespite its advantages, the clinical implementation of GLS in trauma settings faces several challenges. Variability in strain measurement techniques across different echocardiographic platforms, the need for specialized imaging expertise, and the lack of established reference values for trauma patients limit the widespread adoption of this technique [\nTraditional diagnostic tools such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and standard electrocardiography (ECG) often fail to detect subtle myocardial dysfunction in the early post-trauma phase. For instance, several studies have reported that trauma patients with normal LVEF on echocardiography exhibited significantly reduced global longitudinal strain (GLS), indicating occult systolic impairment [\nTrauma-induced myocardial dysfunction is multifactorial, involving both direct mechanical injury and systemic physiological responses. Blunt chest trauma, often resulting from motor vehicle accidents, falls, or physical impact, can cause myocardial contusion, leading to localized ischemia, oedema, and wall motion abnormalities [\nThis narrative review aims to explore the role of longitudinal myocardial deformation as an emerging biomarker for post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction. It examines the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying myocardial impairment in trauma patients, the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods, and the potential advantages of GLS in detecting subclinical myocardial dysfunction. Furthermore, the review discusses the clinical applications of GLS in trauma care, including its role in early diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment monitoring, and long-term follow-up. Future research directions, including the integration of AI in strain analysis and the development of standardized strain assessment protocols, are also highlighted.\nPost-traumatic cardiac dysfunction is a complex and multifaceted condition that arises from a combination of direct myocardial injury, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, neurohormonal activation, and immune dysregulation [\nBlunt chest trauma is one of the most direct causes of myocardial dysfunction in trauma patients [\nA systemic inflammatory response following severe injury is a major driver of trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction. Polytrauma triggers a massive immune response characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) [\nOxidative stress further amplifies myocardial injury in trauma patients. The excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to ischemia–reperfusion injury, hypoxia, and excessive neutrophil activation results in mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis [\nThe neurohormonal response to trauma plays a significant role in cardiac dysfunction. Following severe injury, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, leading to a surge in catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine [\nEndothelial dysfunction and microvascular thrombosis contribute to impaired myocardial perfusion and exacerbate cardiac injury. The inflammatory response following trauma promotes the upregulation of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), facilitating monocyte and neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium [\nAs the inflammatory and oxidative cascades progress, ventricular remodeling and fibrosis develop, leading to long-term structural and functional alterations in the heart. The persistent activation of fibroblasts and excessive collagen deposition stiffen the myocardium, impairing relaxation and reducing compliance [\nGiven the complex and multifactorial nature of trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction, early identification of high-risk patients is essential. Conventional diagnostic tools such as electrocardiography (ECG) and standard echocardiography may not adequately detect subtle myocardial dysfunction. Advanced imaging modalities, including speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) and cardiac MRI, provide more detailed assessments of myocardial mechanics, allowing for earlier detection of contractile abnormalities [\nAnti-inflammatory agents such as IL-1β inhibitors (e.g., canakinumab) have demonstrated potential in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with chronic inflammation and may offer benefits in trauma-related cardiac dysfunction [\nThe pathophysiology of post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction is a complex interplay of mechanical, inflammatory, oxidative, and neurohormonal factors that contribute to acute and chronic myocardial impairment. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for improving early detection, risk stratification, and treatment strategies in trauma patients. By integrating advanced imaging techniques, biomarker profiling, and targeted therapeutic interventions, clinicians can better manage trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction and improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes.\nThe diagnosis of trauma-related cardiac dysfunction remains a significant challenge due to the complex interplay of mechanical injury, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurohormonal activation. While traditional diagnostic tools such as electrocardiography (ECG), conventional echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers provide valuable information, they often fail to detect subtle myocardial dysfunction, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment [\nElectrocardiography (ECG) is widely used in the initial evaluation of trauma patients with suspected cardiac involvement. It is useful for detecting arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and ischemic changes that may indicate myocardial injury. However, ECG has several limitations in the context of trauma-related cardiac dysfunction. Many trauma patients present with non-specific ECG findings that do not provide definitive evidence of myocardial impairment [\nConventional echocardiography is another key tool for assessing cardiac function in trauma patients. It provides real-time imaging of ventricular contractility, wall motion abnormalities, and pericardial effusion, which are critical for diagnosing myocardial contusion, cardiac tamponade, and other forms of post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction [\nAnother limitation of conventional echocardiography is its inability to provide detailed insights into myocardial mechanics. Speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) and strain imaging have emerged as more advanced tools that can assess myocardial deformation, but these techniques are not yet widely used in routine trauma care [\nCardiac biomarkers, including high-sensitivity troponin (hs-Tn) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), play a crucial role in diagnosing myocardial injury [\nBrain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are markers of cardiac stress and heart failure that have been investigated in trauma patients [\nComputed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are additional imaging modalities used in the evaluation of trauma patients [\nThe limitations of traditional diagnostic methods highlight the need for a more comprehensive, multi-modal approach to assessing trauma-related cardiac dysfunction. Integrating advanced imaging techniques such as strain imaging, cardiac MRI, and artificial intelligence-driven diagnostics may improve the early detection and management of myocardial impairment. Additionally, the use of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), could enhance risk stratification and provide a more detailed understanding of trauma-induced cardiac injury.\nMoving forward, the development of personalized diagnostic strategies that incorporate both functional and molecular assessments will be essential in optimizing trauma care. By combining traditional diagnostic tools with emerging technologies, clinicians can improve the accuracy of cardiac assessments, facilitate early intervention, and reduce the long-term cardiovascular burden in trauma survivors. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in trauma cardiology could further enhance the predictive value of diagnostic models by analyzing complex data patterns and identifying high-risk patients more effectively.\nIn conclusion, while traditional diagnostic methods such as ECG, conventional echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers remain valuable in the evaluation of trauma-related cardiac dysfunction, they have significant limitations in detecting early and subclinical myocardial impairment. More advanced techniques, including speckle-tracking echocardiography, biomarker profiling, and cardiac MRI, offer greater sensitivity and specificity in assessing myocardial injury but are not yet widely implemented in trauma care. A multi-disciplinary approach that incorporates emerging diagnostic technologies, personalized risk assessment, and advanced imaging modalities is essential to improving outcomes for trauma patients with cardiac involvement. Continued research into novel diagnostic strategies and the integration of artificial intelligence in trauma cardiology will be crucial in addressing the current limitations and enhancing the precision of post-trauma cardiac evaluations.\nTraditional and emerging diagnostic approaches in trauma-related cardiac dysfunction.\nIn post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction, myocardial deformation abnormalities may arise due to a combination of direct mechanical injury, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurohormonal dysregulation. Trauma patients who sustain blunt chest injuries, such as those caused by motor vehicle accidents or falls, may experience myocardial contusion, leading to localized wall motion abnormalities that can be detected using strain imaging [\nLongitudinal myocardial deformation has emerged as a highly sensitive marker for detecting post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction, offering a more precise and quantitative assessment of myocardial mechanics than traditional diagnostic measures [\nOne of the key advantages of GLS over LVEF is its ability to detect myocardial dysfunction before significant changes in ejection fraction occur [\nSome individuals may experience transient myocardial stunning, a reversible condition characterized by temporary contractile dysfunction due to excessive catecholamine release and ischemia–reperfusion injury. In such cases, GLS can help distinguish between reversible myocardial dysfunction and more severe forms of cardiac injury that may require long-term management. Additionally, in patients with systemic inflammatory responses following trauma, GLS can serve as an indicator of inflammation-related myocardial impairment, offering a potential link between immune activation and cardiac dysfunction.\nIncorporating GLS into trauma care has the potential to improve early detection and guide targeted interventions aimed at preventing long-term complications [\nThe prognostic significance of GLS extends beyond acute trauma care, with implications for long-term cardiovascular health [\nWhile GLS has shown significant promise in the evaluation of post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction, its widespread adoption in trauma settings faces several challenges. One limitation is the need for specialized imaging equipment and expertise in strain analysis, which may not be readily available in all healthcare settings. Additionally, interobserver variability and differences in vendor-specific strain measurement algorithms can impact the reproducibility of GLS results. Standardization of strain imaging protocols and the development of automated strain analysis tools could help address these challenges and facilitate the broader implementation of GLS in trauma care.\nFuture research should focus on refining the clinical applications of GLS in trauma-related cardiac dysfunction, including the establishment of standardized GLS cut-off values for identifying high-risk patients. Large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate the prognostic utility of GLS in trauma populations and determine its role in guiding therapeutic interventions. Additionally, the integration of GLS with other emerging biomarkers, such as inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers, may enhance risk stratification and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying post-traumatic myocardial dysfunction.\nLongitudinal myocardial deformation in trauma-related cardiac dysfunction: a multidimensional overview.\nAs the field of trauma cardiology continues to evolve, longitudinal myocardial deformation analysis represents a promising tool for improving the diagnosis and management of trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction. By providing a more sensitive and quantitative assessment of myocardial function, GLS has the potential to bridge the gap between early myocardial injury detection and long-term cardiovascular risk reduction. The incorporation of strain imaging into routine trauma care could lead to earlier interventions, improved patient outcomes, and a more personalized approach to post-traumatic cardiac management. With continued advancements in imaging technology and a growing body of clinical evidence supporting its use, GLS is poised to become an essential component of trauma cardiology, helping to redefine how myocardial dysfunction is detected and treated in trauma patients.\nLongitudinal myocardial deformation has become a valuable tool for assessing heart function in trauma patients, offering greater sensitivity than traditional methods. Unlike conventional measures such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which may miss early signs of cardiac impairment, this technique provides detailed insights into trauma-related myocardial dysfunction [\nSpeckle-tracking echocardiography (STE), which measures GLS, can detect subtle changes in heart muscle contractility even when LVEF appears normal [\nIn addition to its role in detecting myocardial contusion, longitudinal myocardial deformation is particularly useful in assessing myocardial dysfunction in patients with systemic inflammatory responses following severe trauma [\nAnother critical application of longitudinal myocardial deformation in trauma care is its use in risk stratification and prognostication (\nBeyond risk stratification, longitudinal myocardial deformation plays a crucial role in guiding therapeutic interventions in trauma patients with cardiac dysfunction. The ability to detect early myocardial impairment allows for timely initiation of cardioprotective therapies, such as beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which have been shown to improve myocardial function and reduce the risk of long-term complications [\nThe role of longitudinal myocardial deformation extends beyond the acute phase of trauma care, with significant implications for long-term cardiovascular monitoring [\nAnother promising application of longitudinal myocardial deformation in trauma care is its integration with other advanced imaging modalities, such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) [\nClinical applications of longitudinal myocardial deformation in trauma care.\nDespite its numerous advantages, the widespread adoption of longitudinal myocardial deformation in trauma care faces several challenges. One of the primary limitations is the need for specialized imaging equipment and expertise in strain analysis, which may not be readily available in all healthcare settings. Additionally, variability in strain measurement techniques between different echocardiographic vendors can impact the reproducibility of GLS results, highlighting the need for standardized protocols and calibration methods. Efforts to address these challenges through training programs, standardized guidelines, and automated strain analysis tools will be critical in facilitating the broader implementation of GLS in trauma care.\nWhile speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) offers promising sensitivity for detecting subclinical myocardial dysfunction, its broader clinical application is limited by several important factors. First, the accuracy of strain measurements is highly dependent on the operator’s experience, both in image acquisition and post-processing interpretation. Second, the quality of the echocardiographic images themselves, including endocardial border definition, plays a critical role, particularly in trauma settings where imaging conditions may be suboptimal. Third, frame rate settings must be carefully optimized as strain analysis can be significantly affected by excessively low or high temporal resolution. Fourth, STE is sensitive to changes in loading conditions (preload and afterload), which can alter myocardial deformation patterns independent of intrinsic cardiac function. Fifth, extrinsic mechanical factors, especially chest wall conformation and soft tissue variability, can degrade image quality and strain reliability, particularly in patients with obesity, chest trauma, or surgical dressings [\nFuture research should focus on further validating the clinical applications of longitudinal myocardial deformation in trauma populations through large-scale prospective studies. Establishing GLS reference values for trauma patients and determining optimal cut-off thresholds for risk stratification will enhance its utility as a clinical tool. Additionally, exploring the role of GLS in specific trauma subgroups, such as patients with traumatic brain injury or hemorrhagic shock, could provide valuable insights into its broader applicability in critical care settings. As the field of trauma cardiology continues to evolve, longitudinal myocardial deformation is poised to play an increasingly important role in improving the diagnosis, management, and long-term outcomes of patients with trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction.\nThe ability of GLS to detect early myocardial dysfunction, guide treatment decisions, and predict long-term cardiovascular risk makes it a highly valuable tool in trauma care. By incorporating strain imaging into routine clinical practice, clinicians can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of myocardial function and provide more personalized, evidence-based care for trauma patients. With continued advancements in imaging technology and increasing recognition of the importance of myocardial strain analysis, longitudinal myocardial deformation is set to become a cornerstone of trauma cardiology, paving the way for improved patient outcomes and more effective management of post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction.\nFuture directions and research opportunities in the field of longitudinal myocardial deformation and post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction are vast, offering significant potential to improve early diagnosis, risk stratification, and patient outcomes. As the understanding of trauma-induced myocardial dysfunction continues to evolve, there is a growing need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate advanced imaging techniques, biomarker analysis, and artificial intelligence-driven diagnostics. Expanding research in these areas will enhance clinicians’ ability to detect myocardial dysfunction at its earliest stages, refine therapeutic strategies, and develop personalized treatment plans that reduce long-term cardiovascular risk in trauma patients.\nOne of the most promising areas for future research is the optimization and standardization of GLS measurement in trauma populations. While GLS has demonstrated superior sensitivity in detecting subclinical myocardial dysfunction compared to traditional metrics such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), significant variability remains in strain measurement techniques across different imaging platforms and vendors [\nThe integration of GLS with emerging cardiac biomarkers represents another exciting avenue for future research. While strain imaging provides valuable mechanical insights into myocardial function, the addition of biomarker profiling could offer a more comprehensive assessment of trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction. Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) have been shown to play critical roles in post-traumatic myocardial impairment, and their relationship with myocardial strain abnormalities warrants further investigation [\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have the potential to revolutionize the application of longitudinal myocardial deformation analysis in trauma care [\nThe role of longitudinal myocardial deformation in guiding therapeutic interventions also warrants further exploration [\nLongitudinal studies assessing the long-term cardiovascular impact of trauma-related myocardial dysfunction are critically needed. Many trauma patients, even those who appear to recover fully, may experience lingering cardiac effects that predispose them to heart failure, arrhythmias, and ischemic heart disease later in life. Prospective cohort studies following trauma patients over extended periods will help clarify the relationship between early GLS abnormalities and long-term cardiovascular risk. Additionally, identifying subgroups of trauma patients who are particularly susceptible to chronic cardiac complications—such as those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, systemic inflammatory responses, or prolonged ICU stays—will enable the development of targeted monitoring and intervention strategies.\nAdvancing the role of GLS in pediatric trauma populations is another important area for future research. While myocardial strain imaging has been extensively studied in adults, there are limited data on its application in pediatric trauma patients. Children and adolescents may exhibit different myocardial adaptation responses following trauma, necessitating age-specific GLS reference values and diagnostic criteria. Research efforts should focus on evaluating how longitudinal myocardial deformation evolves across different pediatric age groups and determining whether early GLS abnormalities in children correlate with long-term cardiovascular consequences.\nThe exploration of novel therapeutic targets for mitigating trauma-induced myocardial dysfunction is another crucial direction for future research. Beyond conventional pharmacologic interventions, regenerative medicine approaches, such as stem cell therapy and tissue engineering, hold promise for repairing myocardial damage following trauma. Preclinical studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and exosome-based therapies may enhance myocardial regeneration and improve cardiac function in animal models of injury [\nFinally, research should focus on improving the accessibility and implementation of strain imaging in diverse healthcare settings. While GLS is a powerful diagnostic tool, its widespread adoption is hindered by equipment limitations, training requirements, and cost barriers. Efforts to develop more user-friendly, automated strain imaging technologies could help expand the availability of GLS in both high-resource and low-resource settings. Additionally, integrating GLS into trauma care protocols and emergency medicine workflows will be essential for ensuring its timely use in high-acuity settings.\nFuture directions and research opportunities in the field of longitudinal myocardial deformation and trauma-related cardiac dysfunction hold immense potential to transform patient care (\nLongitudinal myocardial deformation, assessed through global longitudinal strain (GLS), represents a significant advancement in the evaluation of cardiac function following trauma. Unlike traditional diagnostic tools such as electrocardiography, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), or isolated biomarker measurements, GLS offers a sensitive and quantitative measure of subclinical myocardial impairment that often remains undetected in the acute trauma setting. Its ability to identify early contractile dysfunction before structural or hemodynamic deterioration occurs makes it an invaluable tool for timely risk stratification and clinical decision-making.\nThis review underscores the complex, multifactorial nature of post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction, driven by direct mechanical injury, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuro-hormonal activation. GLS has demonstrated clinical relevance across the entire care continuum, from early detection and prognostication to monitoring treatment response and guiding long-term cardiovascular follow-up. Furthermore, the integration of GLS with inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, along with artificial intelligence-driven analytics, holds promise for developing a precision medicine framework in trauma cardiology.\nDespite the growing interest in global longitudinal strain (GLS) as a sensitive and non-invasive marker for post-traumatic myocardial dysfunction, several limitations currently constrain its widespread clinical adoption in trauma settings. First, most of the available data regarding GLS in trauma patients are derived from small-scale, single-center observational studies with limited generalizability. There remains a lack of large, prospective, multicenter trials specifically focused on trauma populations, which hampers the development of standardized GLS-based diagnostic or prognostic algorithms in this context. Second, technical variability in image acquisition protocols and post-processing algorithms used for strain analysis, such as differences between vendor-specific software and inter-observer variability, introduces challenges in reproducibility and cross-institutional consistency. These issues are particularly relevant in acute trauma care, where echocardiographic imaging conditions may be suboptimal. Addressing these limitations through standardized protocols and multicenter validation efforts will be essential to fully integrate GLS into trauma care pathways.\nIn conclusion, GLS has the potential to redefine the diagnostic and prognostic landscape of trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction. By enabling earlier detection, more accurate risk assessment, and individualized patient management, longitudinal myocardial deformation may significantly improve outcomes for trauma patients and reduce the long-term burden of cardiovascular complications.", "content_for_embedding": "Post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction is an under-recognized yet critical consequence of severe trauma, often overlooked in the acute management of polytrauma patients.

For instance, several studies have reported that trauma patients with normal LVEF on echocardiography exhibited significantly reduced global longitudinal strain (GLS), indicating occult systolic impairment [\nTrauma-induced myocardial dysfunction is multifactorial, involving both direct mechanical injury and systemic physiological responses. Blunt chest trauma, often resulting from motor vehicle accidents, falls, or physical impact, can cause myocardial contusion, leading to localized ischemia, oedema, and wall motion abnormalities [\nThis narrative review aims to explore the role of longitudinal myocardial deformation as an emerging biomarker for post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction. It examines the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying myocardial impairment in trauma patients, the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods, and the potential advantages of GLS in detecting subclinical myocardial dysfunction. Furthermore, the review discusses the clinical applications of GLS in trauma care, including its role in early diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment monitoring, and long-term follow-up. Future research directions, including the integration of AI in strain analysis and the development of standardized strain assessment protocols, are also highlighted.\nPost-traumatic cardiac dysfunction is a complex and multifaceted condition that arises from a combination of direct myocardial injury, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, neurohormonal activation, and immune dysregulation [\nBlunt chest trauma is one of the most direct causes of myocardial dysfunction in trauma patients [\nA systemic inflammatory response following severe injury is a major driver of trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction. Polytrauma triggers a massive immune response characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) [\nOxidative stress further amplifies myocardial injury in trauma patients. The excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to ischemia–reperfusion injury, hypoxia, and excessive neutrophil activation results in mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis [\nThe neurohormonal response to trauma plays a significant role in cardiac dysfunction. Following severe injury, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, leading to a surge in catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine [\nEndothelial dysfunction and microvascular thrombosis contribute to impaired myocardial perfusion and exacerbate cardiac injury. The inflammatory response following trauma promotes the upregulation of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), facilitating monocyte and neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium [\nAs the inflammatory and oxidative cascades progress, ventricular remodeling and fibrosis develop, leading to long-term structural and functional alterations in the heart. The persistent activation of fibroblasts and excessive collagen deposition stiffen the myocardium, impairing relaxation and reducing compliance [\nGiven the complex and multifactorial nature of trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction, early identification of high-risk patients is essential. Conventional diagnostic tools such as electrocardiography (ECG) and standard echocardiography may not adequately detect subtle myocardial dysfunction. Advanced imaging modalities, including speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) and cardiac MRI, provide more detailed assessments of myocardial mechanics, allowing for earlier detection of contractile abnormalities [\nAnti-inflammatory agents such as IL-1β inhibitors (e.g., canakinumab) have demonstrated potential in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with chronic inflammation and may offer benefits in trauma-related cardiac dysfunction [\nThe pathophysiology of post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction is a complex interplay of mechanical, inflammatory, oxidative, and neurohormonal factors that contribute to acute and chronic myocardial impairment. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for improving early detection, risk stratification, and treatment strategies in trauma patients. By integrating advanced imaging techniques, biomarker profiling, and targeted therapeutic interventions, clinicians can better manage trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction and improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes.\nThe diagnosis of trauma-related cardiac dysfunction remains a significant challenge due to the complex interplay of mechanical injury, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurohormonal activation. While traditional diagnostic tools such as electrocardiography (ECG), conventional echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers provide valuable information, they often fail to detect subtle myocardial dysfunction, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment [\nElectrocardiography (ECG) is widely used in the initial evaluation of trauma patients with suspected cardiac involvement. It is useful for detecting arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and ischemic changes that may indicate myocardial injury. However, ECG has several limitations in the context of trauma-related cardiac dysfunction. Many trauma patients present with non-specific ECG findings that do not provide definitive evidence of myocardial impairment [\nConventional echocardiography is another key tool for assessing cardiac function in trauma patients. It provides real-time imaging of ventricular contractility, wall motion abnormalities, and pericardial effusion, which are critical for diagnosing myocardial contusion, cardiac tamponade, and other forms of post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction [\nAnother limitation of conventional echocardiography is its inability to provide detailed insights into myocardial mechanics. Speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) and strain imaging have emerged as more advanced tools that can assess myocardial deformation, but these techniques are not yet widely used in routine trauma care [\nCardiac biomarkers, including high-sensitivity troponin (hs-Tn) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), play a crucial role in diagnosing myocardial injury [\nBrain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are markers of cardiac stress and heart failure that have been investigated in trauma patients [\nComputed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are additional imaging modalities used in the evaluation of trauma patients [\nThe limitations of traditional diagnostic methods highlight the need for a more comprehensive, multi-modal approach to assessing trauma-related cardiac dysfunction. Integrating advanced imaging techniques such as strain imaging, cardiac MRI, and artificial intelligence-driven diagnostics may improve the early detection and management of myocardial impairment. Additionally, the use of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), could enhance risk stratification and provide a more detailed understanding of trauma-induced cardiac injury.\nMoving forward, the development of personalized diagnostic strategies that incorporate both functional and molecular assessments will be essential in optimizing trauma care. By combining traditional diagnostic tools with emerging technologies, clinicians can improve the accuracy of cardiac assessments, facilitate early intervention, and reduce the long-term cardiovascular burden in trauma survivors. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in trauma cardiology could further enhance the predictive value of diagnostic models by analyzing complex data patterns and identifying high-risk patients more effectively.\nIn conclusion, while traditional diagnostic methods such as ECG, conventional echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers remain valuable in the evaluation of trauma-related cardiac dysfunction, they have significant limitations in detecting early and subclinical myocardial impairment. More advanced techniques, including speckle-tracking echocardiography, biomarker profiling, and cardiac MRI, offer greater sensitivity and specificity in assessing myocardial injury but are not yet widely implemented in trauma care. A multi-disciplinary approach that incorporates emerging diagnostic technologies, personalized risk assessment, and advanced imaging modalities is essential to improving outcomes for trauma patients with cardiac involvement. Continued research into novel diagnostic strategies and the integration of artificial intelligence in trauma cardiology will be crucial in addressing the current limitations and enhancing the precision of post-trauma cardiac evaluations.\nTraditional and emerging diagnostic approaches in trauma-related cardiac dysfunction.\nIn post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction, myocardial deformation abnormalities may arise due to a combination of direct mechanical injury, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurohormonal dysregulation. Trauma patients who sustain blunt chest injuries, such as those caused by motor vehicle accidents or falls, may experience myocardial contusion, leading to localized wall motion abnormalities that can be detected using strain imaging [\nLongitudinal myocardial deformation has emerged as a highly sensitive marker for detecting post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction, offering a more precise and quantitative assessment of myocardial mechanics than traditional diagnostic measures [\nOne of the key advantages of GLS over LVEF is its ability to detect myocardial dysfunction before significant changes in ejection fraction occur [\nSome individuals may experience transient myocardial stunning, a reversible condition characterized by temporary contractile dysfunction due to excessive catecholamine release and ischemia–reperfusion injury. In such cases, GLS can help distinguish between reversible myocardial dysfunction and more severe forms of cardiac injury that may require long-term management. Additionally, in patients with systemic inflammatory responses following trauma, GLS can serve as an indicator of inflammation-related myocardial impairment, offering a potential link between immune activation and cardiac dysfunction.\nIncorporating GLS into trauma care has the potential to improve early detection and guide targeted interventions aimed at preventing long-term complications [\nThe prognostic significance of GLS extends beyond acute trauma care, with implications for long-term cardiovascular health [\nWhile GLS has shown significant promise in the evaluation of post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction, its widespread adoption in trauma settings faces several challenges. One limitation is the need for specialized imaging equipment and expertise in strain analysis, which may not be readily available in all healthcare settings. Additionally, interobserver variability and differences in vendor-specific strain measurement algorithms can impact the reproducibility of GLS results. Standardization of strain imaging protocols and the development of automated strain analysis tools could help address these challenges and facilitate the broader implementation of GLS in trauma care.\nFuture research should focus on refining the clinical applications of GLS in trauma-related cardiac dysfunction, including the establishment of standardized GLS cut-off values for identifying high-risk patients. Large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate the prognostic utility of GLS in trauma populations and determine its role in guiding therapeutic interventions. Additionally, the integration of GLS with other emerging biomarkers, such as inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers, may enhance risk stratification and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying post-traumatic myocardial dysfunction.\nLongitudinal myocardial deformation in trauma-related cardiac dysfunction: a multidimensional overview.\nAs the field of trauma cardiology continues to evolve, longitudinal myocardial deformation analysis represents a promising tool for improving the diagnosis and management of trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction. By providing a more sensitive and quantitative assessment of myocardial function, GLS has the potential to bridge the gap between early myocardial injury detection and long-term cardiovascular risk reduction. The incorporation of strain imaging into routine trauma care could lead to earlier interventions, improved patient outcomes, and a more personalized approach to post-traumatic cardiac management. With continued advancements in imaging technology and a growing body of clinical evidence supporting its use, GLS is poised to become an essential component of trauma cardiology, helping to redefine how myocardial dysfunction is detected and treated in trauma patients.\nLongitudinal myocardial deformation has become a valuable tool for assessing heart function in trauma patients, offering greater sensitivity than traditional methods. Unlike conventional measures such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which may miss early signs of cardiac impairment, this technique provides detailed insights into trauma-related myocardial dysfunction [\nSpeckle-tracking echocardiography (STE), which measures GLS, can detect subtle changes in heart muscle contractility even when LVEF appears normal [\nIn addition to its role in detecting myocardial contusion, longitudinal myocardial deformation is particularly useful in assessing myocardial dysfunction in patients with systemic inflammatory responses following severe trauma [\nAnother critical application of longitudinal myocardial deformation in trauma care is its use in risk stratification and prognostication (\nBeyond risk stratification, longitudinal myocardial deformation plays a crucial role in guiding therapeutic interventions in trauma patients with cardiac dysfunction. The ability to detect early myocardial impairment allows for timely initiation of cardioprotective therapies, such as beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which have been shown to improve myocardial function and reduce the risk of long-term complications [\nThe role of longitudinal myocardial deformation extends beyond the acute phase of trauma care, with significant implications for long-term cardiovascular monitoring [\nAnother promising application of longitudinal myocardial deformation in trauma care is its integration with other advanced imaging modalities, such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) [\nClinical applications of longitudinal myocardial deformation in trauma care.\nDespite its numerous advantages, the widespread adoption of longitudinal myocardial deformation in trauma care faces several challenges. One of the primary limitations is the need for specialized imaging equipment and expertise in strain analysis, which may not be readily available in all healthcare settings. Additionally, variability in strain measurement techniques between different echocardiographic vendors can impact the reproducibility of GLS results, highlighting the need for standardized protocols and calibration methods. Efforts to address these challenges through training programs, standardized guidelines, and automated strain analysis tools will be critical in facilitating the broader implementation of GLS in trauma care.\nWhile speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) offers promising sensitivity for detecting subclinical myocardial dysfunction, its broader clinical application is limited by several important factors. First, the accuracy of strain measurements is highly dependent on the operator’s experience, both in image acquisition and post-processing interpretation. Second, the quality of the echocardiographic images themselves, including endocardial border definition, plays a critical role, particularly in trauma settings where imaging conditions may be suboptimal. Third, frame rate settings must be carefully optimized as strain analysis can be significantly affected by excessively low or high temporal resolution. Fourth, STE is sensitive to changes in loading conditions (preload and afterload), which can alter myocardial deformation patterns independent of intrinsic cardiac function. Fifth, extrinsic mechanical factors, especially chest wall conformation and soft tissue variability, can degrade image quality and strain reliability, particularly in patients with obesity, chest trauma, or surgical dressings [\nFuture research should focus on further validating the clinical applications of longitudinal myocardial deformation in trauma populations through large-scale prospective studies. Establishing GLS reference values for trauma patients and determining optimal cut-off thresholds for risk stratification will enhance its utility as a clinical tool. Additionally, exploring the role of GLS in specific trauma subgroups, such as patients with traumatic brain injury or hemorrhagic shock, could provide valuable insights into its broader applicability in critical care settings. As the field of trauma cardiology continues to evolve, longitudinal myocardial deformation is poised to play an increasingly important role in improving the diagnosis, management, and long-term outcomes of patients with trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction.\nThe ability of GLS to detect early myocardial dysfunction, guide treatment decisions, and predict long-term cardiovascular risk makes it a highly valuable tool in trauma care. By incorporating strain imaging into routine clinical practice, clinicians can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of myocardial function and provide more personalized, evidence-based care for trauma patients. With continued advancements in imaging technology and increasing recognition of the importance of myocardial strain analysis, longitudinal myocardial deformation is set to become a cornerstone of trauma cardiology, paving the way for improved patient outcomes and more effective management of post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction.\nFuture directions and research opportunities in the field of longitudinal myocardial deformation and post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction are vast, offering significant potential to improve early diagnosis, risk stratification, and patient outcomes. As the understanding of trauma-induced myocardial dysfunction continues to evolve, there is a growing need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate advanced imaging techniques, biomarker analysis, and artificial intelligence-driven diagnostics. Expanding research in these areas will enhance clinicians’ ability to detect myocardial dysfunction at its earliest stages, refine therapeutic strategies, and develop personalized treatment plans that reduce long-term cardiovascular risk in trauma patients.\nOne of the most promising areas for future research is the optimization and standardization of GLS measurement in trauma populations. While GLS has demonstrated superior sensitivity in detecting subclinical myocardial dysfunction compared to traditional metrics such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), significant variability remains in strain measurement techniques across different imaging platforms and vendors [\nThe integration of GLS with emerging cardiac biomarkers represents another exciting avenue for future research. While strain imaging provides valuable mechanical insights into myocardial function, the addition of biomarker profiling could offer a more comprehensive assessment of trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction. Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) have been shown to play critical roles in post-traumatic myocardial impairment, and their relationship with myocardial strain abnormalities warrants further investigation [\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have the potential to revolutionize the application of longitudinal myocardial deformation analysis in trauma care [\nThe role of longitudinal myocardial deformation in guiding therapeutic interventions also warrants further exploration [\nLongitudinal studies assessing the long-term cardiovascular impact of trauma-related myocardial dysfunction are critically needed. Many trauma patients, even those who appear to recover fully, may experience lingering cardiac effects that predispose them to heart failure, arrhythmias, and ischemic heart disease later in life. Prospective cohort studies following trauma patients over extended periods will help clarify the relationship between early GLS abnormalities and long-term cardiovascular risk. Additionally, identifying subgroups of trauma patients who are particularly susceptible to chronic cardiac complications—such as those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, systemic inflammatory responses, or prolonged ICU stays—will enable the development of targeted monitoring and intervention strategies.\nAdvancing the role of GLS in pediatric trauma populations is another important area for future research. While myocardial strain imaging has been extensively studied in adults, there are limited data on its application in pediatric trauma patients. Children and adolescents may exhibit different myocardial adaptation responses following trauma, necessitating age-specific GLS reference values and diagnostic criteria. Research efforts should focus on evaluating how longitudinal myocardial deformation evolves across different pediatric age groups and determining whether early GLS abnormalities in children correlate with long-term cardiovascular consequences.\nThe exploration of novel therapeutic targets for mitigating trauma-induced myocardial dysfunction is another crucial direction for future research. Beyond conventional pharmacologic interventions, regenerative medicine approaches, such as stem cell therapy and tissue engineering, hold promise for repairing myocardial damage following trauma. Preclinical studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and exosome-based therapies may enhance myocardial regeneration and improve cardiac function in animal models of injury [\nFinally, research should focus on improving the accessibility and implementation of strain imaging in diverse healthcare settings. While GLS is a powerful diagnostic tool, its widespread adoption is hindered by equipment limitations, training requirements, and cost barriers. Efforts to develop more user-friendly, automated strain imaging technologies could help expand the availability of GLS in both high-resource and low-resource settings. Additionally, integrating GLS into trauma care protocols and emergency medicine workflows will be essential for ensuring its timely use in high-acuity settings.\nFuture directions and research opportunities in the field of longitudinal myocardial deformation and trauma-related cardiac dysfunction hold immense potential to transform patient care (\nLongitudinal myocardial deformation, assessed through global longitudinal strain (GLS), represents a significant advancement in the evaluation of cardiac function following trauma. Unlike traditional diagnostic tools such as electrocardiography, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), or isolated biomarker measurements, GLS offers a sensitive and quantitative measure of subclinical myocardial impairment that often remains undetected in the acute trauma setting. Its ability to identify early contractile dysfunction before structural or hemodynamic deterioration occurs makes it an invaluable tool for timely risk stratification and clinical decision-making.\nThis review underscores the complex, multifactorial nature of post-traumatic cardiac dysfunction, driven by direct mechanical injury, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuro-hormonal activation. GLS has demonstrated clinical relevance across the entire care continuum, from early detection and prognostication to monitoring treatment response and guiding long-term cardiovascular follow-up. Furthermore, the integration of GLS with inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, along with artificial intelligence-driven analytics, holds promise for developing a precision medicine framework in trauma cardiology.\nDespite the growing interest in global longitudinal strain (GLS) as a sensitive and non-invasive marker for post-traumatic myocardial dysfunction, several limitations currently constrain its widespread clinical adoption in trauma settings. First, most of the available data regarding GLS in trauma patients are derived from small-scale, single-center observational studies with limited generalizability. There remains a lack of large, prospective, multicenter trials specifically focused on trauma populations, which hampers the development of standardized GLS-based diagnostic or prognostic algorithms in this context. Second, technical variability in image acquisition protocols and post-processing algorithms used for strain analysis, such as differences between vendor-specific software and inter-observer variability, introduces challenges in reproducibility and cross-institutional consistency. These issues are particularly relevant in acute trauma care, where echocardiographic imaging conditions may be suboptimal. Addressing these limitations through standardized protocols and multicenter validation efforts will be essential to fully integrate GLS into trauma care pathways.\nIn conclusion, GLS has the potential to redefine the diagnostic and prognostic landscape of trauma-induced cardiac dysfunction. By enabling earlier detection, more accurate risk assessment, and individualized patient management, longitudinal myocardial deformation may significantly improve outcomes for trauma patients and reduce the long-term burden of cardiovascular complications.", "topic": "Neurotransmitter"}

This reversible and dynamic modification involves methyltransferases, demethylases, and reader proteins. Aberrant expression of m6A-related regulatory proteins in the nervous system significantly impacts neuronal physiology, contributing to mental disorders such as depression, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. This review summarizes the role of m6A methylation in the pathogenesis of mental disorders and highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target, providing a comprehensive reference for future research and clinical interventions.", "full_text": "Epigenetic modifications are heritable changes in gene expression driven by environmental factors or intracellular mechanisms that do not alter the DNA sequence.\nMental illnesses represent a significant global challenge, imposing substantial burdens on individuals, society, and economies.\nThe m6A modification is crucial for the normal development and physiological functioning of the nervous system, including its roles in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, synaptic transmission, and the cognitive function.\nGenetic loci regulating m6A levels as quantitative traits (m6A quantitative trait loci, or m6A-QTLs) have been identified in various human tissues, including the brain.\nIn this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying m6A methylation, its roles in psychiatric disorders, and its emerging potential as a therapeutic target. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature search of studies published before October 2024 using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We included original research articles and review papers investigating m6A methylation in the central nervous system and its association with mental disorders, based on human, animal, or cellular models. Articles were selected for their scientific relevance, methodological rigor, and novelty. Given the high prevalence of certain psychiatric conditions and the extent of related m6A research, this review focuses specifically on depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and substance addiction.\nThe m6A methylation modification is a dynamic and reversible process regulated by 3 core groups of factors: methyltransferases (“writers”), demethylases (“erasers”), and reader proteins (“readers”).\nOverview of the m6A RNA modification machinery. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is catalyzed by a multi-component writer complex comprising METTL3, METTL14, METTL16, WTAP, VIRMA (KIAA1429), RBM15/15B, and ZC3H13. These methyltransferases install m6A modifications on mRNA bases. The modification can be reversed by eraser enzymes such as FTO and ALKBH5, which mediate m6A demethylation. Reader proteins, including YTHDF1/2/3, YTHDC1/2, IGF2BP1/2/3, FMRP, PRRC2A, ELAVL1, eIF3, and HNRNPC/A2B1, recognize and bind to m6A-modified RNA to regulate various post-transcriptional processes, such as mRNA translation, degradation, and microRNA processing.\nThe biological functions of m6A methylation modification span a wide range of physiological processes, including hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, the cell cycle, and RNA metabolism.\nThe m6A modification is essential for nervous system development. The methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 play pivotal roles in neuronal differentiation; their deletion impairs the ability of neural stem cells to differentiate into neurons, disrupting neuronal formation and function.\nThe m6A modification also has effects on oligodendrocyte specialization and myelin formation. By recognizing the GGACU consensus motif in the Olig2-encoding sequence, the reading protein PRRC2A binds and stabilizes Olig2 mRNA in an m6A-dependent mechanism.\nThese findings underscore the diverse functions of m6A modification at various stages of nervous system development, including neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, glial cell maturation, and axonal growth. The dynamic regulation of m6A methylation highlights its critical importance as a fundamental mechanism underlying both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions.\nNeural plasticity, the remarkable ability of the nervous system to adapt to internal and external environmental changes, underpins advanced neural functions such as cognition and emotion. In neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, dysregulation of m6A is closely linked to synaptic protein dysfunction, impairing synaptic plasticity and contributing to deficits in learning and memory.\nIn the hippocampus, m6A methylation affects neural plasticity by modulating the miR-124-C/EBPα-FTO transcriptional axis, which regulates the expression of neural plasticity-related genes, such as\nMoreover, recent studies suggest that physical exercise can mitigate mental disorders by counteracting chronic stress-induced neural dysfunction.\nIn addition to stress factors, exposure to certain chemicals in the environment can also alter the level of m6A modification in neurons, thereby affecting neuroplasticity. For example, exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) results in an increase in m6A levels in hippocampal neurons, along with an upregulation of METTL3 expression. Treatment with STM2457, a selective METTL3 inhibitor, effectively suppresses BPA-induced m6A upregulation and restores normal synaptic transmission, further demonstrating the regulatory role of m6A in chemically induced changes in neural plasticity.\nCollectively, these findings highlight the indispensable role of m6A methylation in both the development and maintenance of neural plasticity. By regulating synaptic plasticity and neural function, m6A serves as a critical link between environmental stimuli, gene expression, and behavioral outcomes. Further investigation into the mechanisms of m6A in neural plasticity will deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of mental disorders, such as depression, and provide a strong theoretical foundation for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.\nStudies have highlighted that m6A modification plays a pivotal role in regulating neurotransmitter systems by modulating the expression of key genes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and receptor signaling. This is particularly evident in the dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems, both of which are closely linked to the pathophysiology of mental disorders.\nThe DA system is crucial for regulating emotions, motivation, and reward-related behaviors.\nFurther research has demonstrated that overexpression of FTO or the inhibition of m6A modification leads to a reduction in m6A levels within the striatum, resulting in decreased DA levels. This alteration in DA signaling may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD, suggesting that m6A could be a potential therapeutic target for DA-related disorders.\nSimilar to the DA system, the 5-HT system is vital for regulating mood, emotion, and behavior. m6A modification has been shown to influence 5-HT levels and neuronal transmission by regulating the expression of genes involved in 5-HT synthesis and metabolism.\nIncreasing evidence suggests that m6A methylation significantly influences the expression of inflammation-related genes and contributes to the development of various inflammation-associated diseases. For instance, FTO modulates the stability of cGAS mRNA by regulating m6A methylation levels, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.\nGiven the close correlation between neuroinflammation and the pathogenesis of mental disorders, as well as the role of m6A methylation in regulating neuroinflammatory processes, m6A methylation offers a promising target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating inflammation-related disorders.\nDepression is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, accompanied by intense feelings of guilt, changes in sleep and appetite, and other symptoms. In severe cases, cognitive dysfunction, abnormal behavior, and even hallucinations and delusions may occur.\nRecent studies have indicated that m6A methylation may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression (\nRoles and mechanisms of m6A modification in various mental disorders.\nPlasma or blood-derived population: *1: Patients with the first episode of schizophrenia (\nResearch on the Han Chinese population has revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the demethylase ALKBH5 may be risk factors for MDD in this group.\nFTO, another demethylase, is significantly downregulated in the hippocampus of both MDD patients and depressive mouse, leading to elevated methylation levels of Adrb2 mRNA. This methylation change mediates the development of depressive-like behaviors via the ADRB2-c-MYC-SIRT1 signaling pathway, which is also closely related to the therapeutic effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine.\nThe m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is highly expressed in CUS-induced depressive rat models, and silencing METTL3 improves cognitive deficits. Specifically, METTL3 mediates the m6A modification of pri-miR-221, promoting its maturation and upregulating miR-221-3p, which inhibits\nAs an important RNA modification, m6A methylation has shown potential as a biomarker in the diagnosis of various diseases, including cancers,\nPreclinical studies have demonstrated that modulating m6A levels can effectively reverse depressive-like behaviors in animal models. For instance, injecting cycloleucine, a compound that reduces m6A methylation by competitively inhibiting methionine adenosyltransferase (the enzyme responsible for synthesizing S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the primary methyl donor for DNA and RNA methylation) into a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors.\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by significant geographical and demographic variations. The incidence rate typically ranges from 0.5% to 1% in various countries and regions, although it may be higher in specific populations.\nResearch has demonstrated that dynamic changes in m6A modification are crucial for regulating neuronal function and are closely associated with the pathological mechanisms of schizophrenia. In the brain tissue of schizophrenia patients, abnormal levels of m6A modification may lead to dysregulated expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment and neuronal function, which subsequently affect neuronal morphology and functionality, potentially contributing to schizophrenia’s onset.\nThe development of schizophrenia is often associated with disrupted synaptic plasticity.\nIn addition to its role in disease onset, m6A modification is also implicated in the response to antipsychotic treatments. Studies have found significant changes in the methylation patterns of both DNA and RNA in schizophrenia patients following conventional drug treatment.\nThrough the analysis of m6A methylation patterns, researchers are gaining a deeper understanding of the biological basis of schizophrenia, thereby providing new approaches for early screening and personalized treatment.\nAutism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication skills, along with repetitive behaviors and restricted interests.\nIntegrated analysis of multi-omics data has revealed that abnormalities in m6A modification are closely linked to the onset of ASD,\nIn recent years, an increasing body of research has suggested that m6A methylation modification may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ASD. Through integrative multi-omics analyses, studies have found that abnormal m6A modification is closely associated with the onset of ASD.\nAnimal models and in vitro cell experiments have also confirmed the involvement of m6A modification in ASD pathogenesis. By manipulating m6A modification levels in cells using gene editing technologies, researchers observed gene expression changes associated with ASD, providing direct evidence for the role of m6A modification in the disorder.\nN6-methyladenosine modification contributes to the pathological process of ASD by regulating key signaling pathways. One critical m6A reader protein, YTHDF1, plays an essential role in axon and dendrite development. YTHDF1 regulates synaptic development and plasticity by promoting the translation of Robo3.1, an axon guidance protein. However, when mutations occur at the m6A modification sites, YTHDF1 loses its ability to regulate Robo3.1 translation, resulting in abnormal synaptic transmission and plasticity, which subsequently impairs memory consolidation.\nMoreover, research has found that in the hippocampal tissue of ASD patients or model mice, the expression of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is significantly downregulated, accompanied by downregulation of long non-coding RNA MALAT1 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while the expression of the inhibitory molecule SFRP2 is upregulated. These changes contribute to the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, exacerbating the pathological process of ASD.\nAbnormal m6A modification in ASD patients exhibits significant molecular characteristics, which could potentially serve as biomarkers for the disorder. By detecting m6A levels in peripheral blood, researchers could identify high-risk individuals for ASD before clinical symptoms appear, facilitating early intervention. Additionally, the combined use of m6A detection with other biomarkers, in conjunction with multi-omics data, could significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of ASD screening.\nCurrent research indicates that targeting m6A methylation regulation may provide new therapeutic strategies for ASD. For example, modulating METTL3 expression levels could repair the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, reduce hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and improve ASD-related behaviors. This highlights the important role of m6A modification in the pathogenesis of ASD and its potential as a therapeutic target. Future large-scale clinical studies and in-depth mechanistic investigations will provide further evidence to support this field.\nDrug addiction is a chronic and relapsing brain disorder, primarily characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, along with a loss of control over drug consumption.\nCocaine is a highly addictive stimulant. Research has shown that in a cocaine-induced mouse conditioned place preference (CPP) experiment, the expression of FTO in the hippocampus was significantly downregulated, while the expression of methyltransferases such as METTL3 and METTL14 did not show significant changes. This suggests that FTO may play a key role in the regulation of cocaine addiction. Further analysis through methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq), a technique that maps m6A-methylated RNA, revealed that the overall m6A modification levels in the hippocampus of cocaine-treated mice were significantly elevated when compared with control group, with changes in m6A peaks primarily involving genes related to glutamatergic synapses, long-term potentiation (LTP), axon guidance, and neuronal function. These findings indicate that the dynamic changes in FTO expression and m6A modification may mediate the onset of cocaine addiction by regulating synaptic maturation and localization.\nIn a separate study using opioids such as oxycodone to induce rewarding behaviors in mice, researchers observed a marked increase in the protein levels of METTL14 and overall m6A modification in striatal neurons. In contrast, the expression of PP1α, a protein phosphatase, was found to decrease. These results suggest a close relationship between m6A methylation and opioid addiction. Further investigation pointed to lncRNA HOTAIR as a potential mediator in this process.\nIn contrast to cocaine addiction, a study on morphine addiction in mice found that neither acute nor chronic morphine exposure significantly altered m6A modification levels or the expression of m6A methyltransferases (such as METTL3) in the brain. This suggests that m6A methylation modification may not be involved in the regulatory process of morphine addiction, or its mechanisms may differ from those involved in other addictive substances.\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is another prevalent form of addiction characterized by compulsive drinking, alcohol craving, increased tolerance, and severe withdrawal symptoms. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region involved in DA-mediated reward and pleasure, has been implicated in the development of alcohol addiction. In a mouse model of long-term alcohol consumption, RNA methylation changes were associated with specific gene expression alterations, leading to enhanced neural adaptation to alcohol. Through epigenomic microarray analysis, researchers identified 26 mRNAs and 4 lncRNAs in the NAc of AUD subjects that were highly methylated, while the methylation level of 3 mRNAs and 1 lncRNA was significantly reduced. These results suggest that m6A methylation may play a role in the neural adaptation processes underlying alcohol addiction. However, these findings need to be replicated in larger sample sizes, and future research should explore whether these changes are gender- or population-specific.\nThis review focused on 4 major psychiatric disorders—depression, schizophrenia, ASD, and drug addiction. Although other conditions such as anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorder also exhibit high prevalence and clinical importance, current research on m6A modification in these disorders remains limited. This gap underscores the need for future investigations, which may contribute to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets across a broader range of psychiatric conditions.\nThrough an integrated analysis of m6A modifications in the aforementioned disorders, we found that several key m6A-regulating enzymes, such as METTL3, ALKBH5, and FTO, exhibit similar patterns of dysregulation across different mental illnesses. Moreover, these enzymes are primarily involved in the onset and progression of psychiatric disorders by modulating similar processes, including neuroinflammation, neurodevelopment, and synaptic plasticity. These parallels not only reflect the presence of shared pathogenic mechanisms among various mental disorders but also underscore the indispensable role of m6A regulatory enzymes in initiating epitranscriptomic alterations that contribute to disease development.\nNevertheless, it is important to recognize that, although current studies on m6A modification in mental disorders remain limited, distinct brain region- or cell types-specific differences have been observed in the patterns of m6A modification and the expression of its regulatory enzymes across different psychiatric conditions. The specific RNAs undergoing m6A modification, as well as the downstream signaling pathways they modulate, also vary widely. Therefore, further elucidation of the downstream molecular networks governed by m6A modification is critically needed.\nLooking forward, this complexity poses an important question for therapeutic development: should strategies targeting m6A pathways adopt a broad-spectrum approach, or be tailored specifically to the molecular landscape of each disorder? Addressing this question will be essential for translating m6A-related findings into clinically meaningful interventions.\nFurthermore, the emergence of single-cell sequencing technologies provides new opportunities to investigate m6A methylation dynamics at high resolution. Future studies leveraging these approaches will enhance our understanding of m6A functions in distinct neuronal subtypes and disease-relevant cellular contexts.\nFinally, the development of small-molecule modulators—such as agonists or antagonists of m6A-associated proteins—holds great promise for therapeutic innovation. Such tools may enable precision medicine approaches tailored to individual molecular profiles. Continued research in this direction will not only deepen our understanding of m6A biology but also advance the design of effective, targeted treatments for psychiatric disorders.", "content_for_embedding": "Epigenetic modifications are heritable changes in gene expression driven by environmental factors or intracellular mechanisms that do not alter the DNA sequence.\nMental illnesses represent a significant global challenge, imposing substantial burdens on individuals, society, and economies.\nThe m6A modification is crucial for the normal development and physiological functioning of the nervous system, including its roles in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, synaptic transmission, and the cognitive function.\nGenetic loci regulating m6A levels as quantitative traits (m6A quantitative trait loci, or m6A-QTLs) have been identified in various human tissues, including the brain.\nIn this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying m6A methylation, its roles in psychiatric disorders, and its emerging potential as a therapeutic target. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature search of studies published before October 2024 using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We included original research articles and review papers investigating m6A methylation in the central nervous system and its association with mental disorders, based on human, animal, or cellular models. Articles were selected for their scientific relevance, methodological rigor, and novelty. Given the high prevalence of certain psychiatric conditions and the extent of related m6A research, this review focuses specifically on depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and substance addiction.\nThe m6A methylation modification is a dynamic and reversible process regulated by 3 core groups of factors: methyltransferases (“writers”), demethylases (“erasers”), and reader proteins (“readers”).\nOverview of the m6A RNA modification machinery. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is catalyzed by a multi-component writer complex comprising METTL3, METTL14, METTL16, WTAP, VIRMA (KIAA1429), RBM15/15B, and ZC3H13. These methyltransferases install m6A modifications on mRNA bases. The modification can be reversed by eraser enzymes such as FTO and ALKBH5, which mediate m6A demethylation. Reader proteins, including YTHDF1/2/3, YTHDC1/2, IGF2BP1/2/3, FMRP, PRRC2A, ELAVL1, eIF3, and HNRNPC/A2B1, recognize and bind to m6A-modified RNA to regulate various post-transcriptional processes, such as mRNA translation, degradation, and microRNA processing.\nThe biological functions of m6A methylation modification span a wide range of physiological processes, including hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, the cell cycle, and RNA metabolism.\nThe m6A modification is essential for nervous system development. The methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 play pivotal roles in neuronal differentiation; their deletion impairs the ability of neural stem cells to differentiate into neurons, disrupting neuronal formation and function.\nThe m6A modification also has effects on oligodendrocyte specialization and myelin formation. By recognizing the GGACU consensus motif in the Olig2-encoding sequence, the reading protein PRRC2A binds and stabilizes Olig2 mRNA in an m6A-dependent mechanism.\nThese findings underscore the diverse functions of m6A modification at various stages of nervous system development, including neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, glial cell maturation, and axonal growth. The dynamic regulation of m6A methylation highlights its critical importance as a fundamental mechanism underlying both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions.\nNeural plasticity, the remarkable ability of the nervous system to adapt to internal and external environmental changes, underpins advanced neural functions such as cognition and emotion. In neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, dysregulation of m6A is closely linked to synaptic protein dysfunction, impairing synaptic plasticity and contributing to deficits in learning and memory.\nIn the hippocampus, m6A methylation affects neural plasticity by modulating the miR-124-C/EBPα-FTO transcriptional axis, which regulates the expression of neural plasticity-related genes, such as\nMoreover, recent studies suggest that physical exercise can mitigate mental disorders by counteracting chronic stress-induced neural dysfunction.\nIn addition to stress factors, exposure to certain chemicals in the environment can also alter the level of m6A modification in neurons, thereby affecting neuroplasticity. For example, exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) results in an increase in m6A levels in hippocampal neurons, along with an upregulation of METTL3 expression. Treatment with STM2457, a selective METTL3 inhibitor, effectively suppresses BPA-induced m6A upregulation and restores normal synaptic transmission, further demonstrating the regulatory role of m6A in chemically induced changes in neural plasticity.\nCollectively, these findings highlight the indispensable role of m6A methylation in both the development and maintenance of neural plasticity. By regulating synaptic plasticity and neural function, m6A serves as a critical link between environmental stimuli, gene expression, and behavioral outcomes. Further investigation into the mechanisms of m6A in neural plasticity will deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of mental disorders, such as depression, and provide a strong theoretical foundation for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.\nStudies have highlighted that m6A modification plays a pivotal role in regulating neurotransmitter systems by modulating the expression of key genes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, release, and receptor signaling. This is particularly evident in the dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems, both of which are closely linked to the pathophysiology of mental disorders.\nThe DA system is crucial for regulating emotions, motivation, and reward-related behaviors.\nFurther research has demonstrated that overexpression of FTO or the inhibition of m6A modification leads to a reduction in m6A levels within the striatum, resulting in decreased DA levels. This alteration in DA signaling may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD, suggesting that m6A could be a potential therapeutic target for DA-related disorders.\nSimilar to the DA system, the 5-HT system is vital for regulating mood, emotion, and behavior. m6A modification has been shown to influence 5-HT levels and neuronal transmission by regulating the expression of genes involved in 5-HT synthesis and metabolism.\nIncreasing evidence suggests that m6A methylation significantly influences the expression of inflammation-related genes and contributes to the development of various inflammation-associated diseases. For instance, FTO modulates the stability of cGAS mRNA by regulating m6A methylation levels, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.\nGiven the close correlation between neuroinflammation and the pathogenesis of mental disorders, as well as the role of m6A methylation in regulating neuroinflammatory processes, m6A methylation offers a promising target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating inflammation-related disorders.\nDepression is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent low mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, accompanied by intense feelings of guilt, changes in sleep and appetite, and other symptoms. In severe cases, cognitive dysfunction, abnormal behavior, and even hallucinations and delusions may occur.\nRecent studies have indicated that m6A methylation may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression (\nRoles and mechanisms of m6A modification in various mental disorders.\nPlasma or blood-derived population: *1: Patients with the first episode of schizophrenia (\nResearch on the Han Chinese population has revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the demethylase ALKBH5 may be risk factors for MDD in this group.\nFTO, another demethylase, is significantly downregulated in the hippocampus of both MDD patients and depressive mouse, leading to elevated methylation levels of Adrb2 mRNA. This methylation change mediates the development of depressive-like behaviors via the ADRB2-c-MYC-SIRT1 signaling pathway, which is also closely related to the therapeutic effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine.\nThe m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is highly expressed in CUS-induced depressive rat models, and silencing METTL3 improves cognitive deficits. Specifically, METTL3 mediates the m6A modification of pri-miR-221, promoting its maturation and upregulating miR-221-3p, which inhibits\nAs an important RNA modification, m6A methylation has shown potential as a biomarker in the diagnosis of various diseases, including cancers,\nPreclinical studies have demonstrated that modulating m6A levels can effectively reverse depressive-like behaviors in animal models. For instance, injecting cycloleucine, a compound that reduces m6A methylation by competitively inhibiting methionine adenosyltransferase (the enzyme responsible for synthesizing S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the primary methyl donor for DNA and RNA methylation) into a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors.\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by significant geographical and demographic variations. The incidence rate typically ranges from 0.5% to 1% in various countries and regions, although it may be higher in specific populations.\nResearch has demonstrated that dynamic changes in m6A modification are crucial for regulating neuronal function and are closely associated with the pathological mechanisms of schizophrenia. In the brain tissue of schizophrenia patients, abnormal levels of m6A modification may lead to dysregulated expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment and neuronal function, which subsequently affect neuronal morphology and functionality, potentially contributing to schizophrenia’s onset.\nThe development of schizophrenia is often associated with disrupted synaptic plasticity.\nIn addition to its role in disease onset, m6A modification is also implicated in the response to antipsychotic treatments. Studies have found significant changes in the methylation patterns of both DNA and RNA in schizophrenia patients following conventional drug treatment.\nThrough the analysis of m6A methylation patterns, researchers are gaining a deeper understanding of the biological basis of schizophrenia, thereby providing new approaches for early screening and personalized treatment.\nAutism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication skills, along with repetitive behaviors and restricted interests.\nIntegrated analysis of multi-omics data has revealed that abnormalities in m6A modification are closely linked to the onset of ASD,\nIn recent years, an increasing body of research has suggested that m6A methylation modification may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ASD. Through integrative multi-omics analyses, studies have found that abnormal m6A modification is closely associated with the onset of ASD.\nAnimal models and in vitro cell experiments have also confirmed the involvement of m6A modification in ASD pathogenesis. By manipulating m6A modification levels in cells using gene editing technologies, researchers observed gene expression changes associated with ASD, providing direct evidence for the role of m6A modification in the disorder.\nN6-methyladenosine modification contributes to the pathological process of ASD by regulating key signaling pathways. One critical m6A reader protein, YTHDF1, plays an essential role in axon and dendrite development. YTHDF1 regulates synaptic development and plasticity by promoting the translation of Robo3.1, an axon guidance protein. However, when mutations occur at the m6A modification sites, YTHDF1 loses its ability to regulate Robo3.1 translation, resulting in abnormal synaptic transmission and plasticity, which subsequently impairs memory consolidation.\nMoreover, research has found that in the hippocampal tissue of ASD patients or model mice, the expression of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 is significantly downregulated, accompanied by downregulation of long non-coding RNA MALAT1 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while the expression of the inhibitory molecule SFRP2 is upregulated. These changes contribute to the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, exacerbating the pathological process of ASD.\nAbnormal m6A modification in ASD patients exhibits significant molecular characteristics, which could potentially serve as biomarkers for the disorder. By detecting m6A levels in peripheral blood, researchers could identify high-risk individuals for ASD before clinical symptoms appear, facilitating early intervention. Additionally, the combined use of m6A detection with other biomarkers, in conjunction with multi-omics data, could significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of ASD screening.\nCurrent research indicates that targeting m6A methylation regulation may provide new therapeutic strategies for ASD. For example, modulating METTL3 expression levels could repair the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, reduce hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and improve ASD-related behaviors. This highlights the important role of m6A modification in the pathogenesis of ASD and its potential as a therapeutic target. Future large-scale clinical studies and in-depth mechanistic investigations will provide further evidence to support this field.\nDrug addiction is a chronic and relapsing brain disorder, primarily characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, along with a loss of control over drug consumption.\nCocaine is a highly addictive stimulant. Research has shown that in a cocaine-induced mouse conditioned place preference (CPP) experiment, the expression of FTO in the hippocampus was significantly downregulated, while the expression of methyltransferases such as METTL3 and METTL14 did not show significant changes. This suggests that FTO may play a key role in the regulation of cocaine addiction. Further analysis through methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq), a technique that maps m6A-methylated RNA, revealed that the overall m6A modification levels in the hippocampus of cocaine-treated mice were significantly elevated when compared with control group, with changes in m6A peaks primarily involving genes related to glutamatergic synapses, long-term potentiation (LTP), axon guidance, and neuronal function. These findings indicate that the dynamic changes in FTO expression and m6A modification may mediate the onset of cocaine addiction by regulating synaptic maturation and localization.\nIn a separate study using opioids such as oxycodone to induce rewarding behaviors in mice, researchers observed a marked increase in the protein levels of METTL14 and overall m6A modification in striatal neurons. In contrast, the expression of PP1α, a protein phosphatase, was found to decrease. These results suggest a close relationship between m6A methylation and opioid addiction. Further investigation pointed to lncRNA HOTAIR as a potential mediator in this process.\nIn contrast to cocaine addiction, a study on morphine addiction in mice found that neither acute nor chronic morphine exposure significantly altered m6A modification levels or the expression of m6A methyltransferases (such as METTL3) in the brain. This suggests that m6A methylation modification may not be involved in the regulatory process of morphine addiction, or its mechanisms may differ from those involved in other addictive substances.\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is another prevalent form of addiction characterized by compulsive drinking, alcohol craving, increased tolerance, and severe withdrawal symptoms. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain region involved in DA-mediated reward and pleasure, has been implicated in the development of alcohol addiction. In a mouse model of long-term alcohol consumption, RNA methylation changes were associated with specific gene expression alterations, leading to enhanced neural adaptation to alcohol. Through epigenomic microarray analysis, researchers identified 26 mRNAs and 4 lncRNAs in the NAc of AUD subjects that were highly methylated, while the methylation level of 3 mRNAs and 1 lncRNA was significantly reduced. These results suggest that m6A methylation may play a role in the neural adaptation processes underlying alcohol addiction. However, these findings need to be replicated in larger sample sizes, and future research should explore whether these changes are gender- or population-specific.\nThis review focused on 4 major psychiatric disorders—depression, schizophrenia, ASD, and drug addiction. Although other conditions such as anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorder also exhibit high prevalence and clinical importance, current research on m6A modification in these disorders remains limited. This gap underscores the need for future investigations, which may contribute to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets across a broader range of psychiatric conditions.\nThrough an integrated analysis of m6A modifications in the aforementioned disorders, we found that several key m6A-regulating enzymes, such as METTL3, ALKBH5, and FTO, exhibit similar patterns of dysregulation across different mental illnesses. Moreover, these enzymes are primarily involved in the onset and progression of psychiatric disorders by modulating similar processes, including neuroinflammation, neurodevelopment, and synaptic plasticity.

Her distress manifested through persistent sadness, mood instability, and emotional numbness, accompanied by increased irritability and feelings of hopelessness. She also reported cognitive difficulties, including excessive worry, intrusive negative thoughts, and trouble concentrating.\nBehaviorally, she experienced social withdrawal, sleep disturbances, and changes in appetite. Physically, she complained of fatigue, muscle tension, headaches, and occasional palpitations. These symptoms significantly affected her daily life, contributing to a decline in academic performance and overall well-being.\nIn June 2022, she was diagnosed with Graves’ disease, a condition known to exacerbate emotional distress through hormonal imbalances affecting mood and psychological stability. She was started on medical treatment with carbimazole (30 mg daily) and propranolol (20 mg daily) to regulate thyroid function and alleviate associated symptoms. Given the interplay between her endocrine condition and psycho-affective distress, a multidisciplinary approach, including psychological support, was considered essential for her overall recovery.\nIn January 2024, she began experiencing fatigue in her lower limbs, noticeable during walking and stair climbing, which later progressed to involve the upper limbs. In addition, she developed visual difficulties, including variable bilateral ptosis, intermittent diplopia, and challenges with chewing solid foods. On 13 April 2024, she was admitted to the medical ward at Mulago National Referral Hospital owing to an inability to rise from a squatting position.\nExamination revealed a nasal voice, bilateral ptosis more prominent on the right, and intermittent diplopia.

The patient responded well to antithyroid medications and beta-blockers.\nNeuromuscular function improved with anticholinesterase therapy (Prostigmine). There was no evidence of myasthenic crisis or recurrence of severe muscle weakness.\nThe patient remained hemodynamically stable, with no further cardiac events or respiratory distress during the hospital stay.\nAfter 11 days of hospitalization, the patient was deemed stable and discharged with a comprehensive outpatient management plan.\nPost-discharge, the patient was placed under regular outpatient follow-up with neurology and endocrinology teams to ensure ongoing management of myasthenia gravis and Graves’ disease.\nThe post-cardiopulmonary resuscitation period was uneventful, and the patient showed significant clinical improvement by the time of discharge. She remains under regular review to monitor for relapse or complications, with an overall favorable prognosis given the early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management approach.\nThe co-existence of myasthenia gravis (MG) and Graves’ disease presents a complex clinical scenario requiring tailored management strategies. In this case, the diagnosis of Graves’ disease preceded the onset of MG by 2 years, aligning with literature indicating that hyperthyroidism precedes MG in approximately 40–50% of cases. Conversely, MG is diagnosed first in 30–35% of cases, while both conditions are identified simultaneously in 20–25% [\nThe patient’s family history revealed Graves’ disease in her father. The prevalence of concurrent MG and hyperthyroidism varies, with estimates suggesting that 2–3% of individuals with hyperthyroidism have MG, and 2–17.5% of MG patients experience thyrotoxicosis. Epidemiologically, both conditions exhibit a female predominance, with incidence peaking between 20 and 40 years of age [\nThis patient presented with generalized myasthenia, although hyperthyroidism is more frequently associated with spino-bulbar forms of MG [\nThe thymus plays a significant role in MG, with frequent thymic abnormalities, including follicular hyperplasia in 65% of cases and thymoma in 10–15% [\nThyroid scintigraphy, ultrasonography, and functional tests confirmed Graves’ disease in this patient. Immunologically, ANA positivity in the absence of lupus-specific symptoms was attributed to MG [\nGiven the autoimmune nature of both conditions and their potential for mutual exacerbation, a multidisciplinary approach was essential in managing the patient’s condition. Upon admission, she presented with acute respiratory failure, pharyngeal pain, and rapid respiratory arrest. Emergency intervention was initiated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and Ambu mask ventilation, successfully restoring respiratory function. The administration of Prostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, resulted in symptom reversal, confirming the suspicion of coexisting myasthenia gravis (MG) and Graves’ disease [\nOnce stabilized, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for continuous monitoring of vital signs, neurological status, and respiratory function. Special attention was given to cardiac function and the prevention of potential neurological deficits due to hypoxic injury. To address her Graves’ disease, she was maintained on carbimazole (30 mg daily) to suppress excessive thyroid hormone production and propranolol (20 mg daily) to control hyperadrenergic symptoms such as palpitations and tremors [\nThroughout her hospitalization, her thyroid function was closely monitored to prevent thyrotoxic crises, which could further exacerbate her MG symptoms. Neuromuscular function improved with the continued administration of Prostigmine, and there was no recurrence of severe muscle weakness or evidence of a myasthenic crisis. For long-term management of MG, corticosteroids such as prednisone were considered, though initiated cautiously owing to their potential to transiently worsen symptoms [\nFor severe exacerbations, plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IG) was available as an option to rapidly reduce circulating autoantibodies and improve muscle strength [\nOver the course of 11 days, the patient demonstrated steady clinical improvement, remained hemodynamically stable, and experienced no further respiratory distress or cardiac complications. Given her positive response to treatment, she was discharged with a comprehensive outpatient management plan, including continued antithyroid therapy, beta-blockers, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. In addition, psychological support was recommended to address the psycho-affective distress associated with her chronic illness and personal circumstances. Close follow-up was scheduled to ensure continued symptom control and to prevent disease exacerbation. A multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists, endocrinologists, and intensive care specialists was crucial in optimizing the patient’s management and ensuring long-term stability [\nThe prognosis for co-morbid MG and Graves’ disease varies. In approximately 40% of cases, MG improves while hyperthyroidism worsens; in 20%, thyrotoxicosis is controlled but MG persists [\nThis patient was administered a low dose of corticosteroids to mitigate the risk of transient MG exacerbation associated with steroid initiation. In addition, radioactive iodine therapy was provided. The patient demonstrated improvement and remains under regular follow-up.\nThe co-occurrence of MG and Graves’ disease is not coincidental and should be considered in clinical practice. MG should be suspected in patients with Graves’ disease presenting with ptosis, nystagmus, or persistent myogenic symptoms despite thyroid hormone regulation. Radiological imaging, particularly in conjunction with immunoassays, is critical in diagnosing these conditions and identifying associated thymic pathology, such as thymoma.

Musculoskeletal examination showed reduced reflexes and scapular muscle atrophy, with an inability to lift the arms above the horizontal plane. Sensory function remained intact, and no abnormalities were noted in the skin, joints, cardiovascular, or respiratory systems.\nApproximately 2 hours after admission, the patient experienced acute respiratory failure accompanied by pharyngeal pain, which rapidly progressed to respiratory arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Ambu mask ventilation, and administration of a test dose of Prostigmine were performed, leading to symptom resolution. A working diagnosis of Graves’ disease complicated by myasthenia gravis was established.\nA timeline table illustrates the sequence of events in the patient’s clinical course (Table\nTimeline highlighting the sequence of events in the patient’s clinical course\nExperienced psycho-affective distress following parental separation\nPositive family history of Graves’ disease (father)\nJune: Diagnosed with Graves’ disease; commenced on carbimazole (30 mg daily) and propranolol (20 mg daily)\nOnset of fatigue in lower limbs during walking and stair climbing, progressing to the upper limbs\nDeveloped visual issues (bilateral ptosis, intermittent diplopia)\nChewing difficulties with solid foods\n13 April: Admitted to Mulago National Referral Hospital with difficulty standing from a squatting position\nExamination findings:\n- Bilateral ptosis (right side more pronounced)\n- Intermittent diplopia\n- Vascular, non-compressive goiter with bruit\n- Bilateral exophthalmos\n- Musculoskeletal: reduced reflexes, scapular muscle atrophy, inability to raise arms above horizontal\n- Sensory function intact\n- No abnormalities in skin, joints, cardiovascular, or respiratory systems\n- Acute respiratory failure with pharyngeal pain and rapid respiratory arrest\n- Managed with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Ambu mask ventilation, and Prostigmine, achieving symptom reversal\n-\nOn the third day of admission, following three doses of subcutaneous Prostigmine, electrophysiological studies demonstrated a significant reduction in neuromuscular transmission (19–62%) in the orbicularis oculi and abductor pollicis brevis muscles, consistent with a diagnosis of generalized, severe myasthenia gravis.\nThe patient’s thyroid function tests revealed a suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and elevated levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), with mildly raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP), findings consistent with Graves’ disease (Table\nThyroid function tests\n\nAnti-nuclear antibodies (ANA): positive (1:160, homogeneous pattern).\nAnti-U1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies: positive (9 IU).\nAnti-DNA antibodies and anti-Sm antibodies: negative.\nAnti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies: positive (16.9 nmol/L; normal < 0.2 nmol/L).\nThe immunology profile indicates a complex autoimmune overlap syndrome. The strongly positive anti-AChR antibodies confirm myasthenia gravis, while the positive ANA and anti-U1 RNP antibodies suggest a possible coexisting autoimmune connective tissue disorder or a generalized autoimmune predisposition. The absence of anti-DNA and anti-Sm antibodies makes systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) less likely, but the patient may still exhibit features of other autoimmune conditions, such as Graves’ disease, as suggested by the thyroid function tests.\nThe full blood count was within normal parameters.\nTransverse ultrasound image showing a moderately enlarged 25 mm × 20 mm thyroid gland with reduced echogenicity (B-mode) and an increased vascular pattern on directional power imaging—a phenomenon known as thyroid inferno\nScintigraphic imaging using Tc-99m pertechnetate demonstrated an enlarged thyroid gland (Figs.\nFigure\nFigure\nAnterior view of thyroid scintigraphy with Tc-99m pertechnetate, showing homogeneous increased activity in an enlarged thyroid gland\nAnterior view with marker Tc-99m pertechnetate, showing no retrosternal extension of the thyroid gland\nHistopathological examination revealed features indicative of glandular activation, including: enlarged follicular cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm; hyperplastic follicles exhibiting papillary epithelial infoldings; colloid reabsorption characterized by scalloping at the apical membrane; and varying degrees of follicular collapse and depletion. These findings (illustrated in Fig.\nHematoxylin and eosin stain at 100× magnification—thyroid parenchyma showing features of thyroid hyperactivity, as seen in Graves’ disease, with scalloping, partial follicular collapse, and follicular depletion\nFollowing successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the patient’s post-resuscitation course was closely monitored for potential complications associated with both the underlying conditions and the resuscitation process.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for continuous monitoring of vital signs, neurological status, and respiratory function.\nSpecial attention was given to cardiac function and potential neurological deficits due to hypoxic injury.\nOver the following days, the patient exhibited progressive clinical improvement, with stabilization of cardiac function, neurological status, and muscle strength.\nThyroid function was closely monitored and managed to prevent thyrotoxic crises, which could exacerbate myasthenia gravis (MG) symptoms. The patient responded well to antithyroid medications and beta-blockers.\nNeuromuscular function improved with anticholinesterase therapy (Prostigmine). There was no evidence of myasthenic crisis or recurrence of severe muscle weakness.\nThe patient remained hemodynamically stable, with no further cardiac events or respiratory distress during the hospital stay.\nAfter 11 days of hospitalization, the patient was deemed stable and discharged with a comprehensive outpatient management plan.\nPost-discharge, the patient was placed under regular outpatient follow-up with neurology and endocrinology teams to ensure ongoing management of myasthenia gravis and Graves’ disease.\nThe post-cardiopulmonary resuscitation period was uneventful, and the patient showed significant clinical improvement by the time of discharge. She remains under regular review to monitor for relapse or complications, with an overall favorable prognosis given the early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management approach.\nThe co-existence of myasthenia gravis (MG) and Graves’ disease presents a complex clinical scenario requiring tailored management strategies. In this case, the diagnosis of Graves’ disease preceded the onset of MG by 2 years, aligning with literature indicating that hyperthyroidism precedes MG in approximately 40–50% of cases. Conversely, MG is diagnosed first in 30–35% of cases, while both conditions are identified simultaneously in 20–25% [\nThe patient’s family history revealed Graves’ disease in her father. The prevalence of concurrent MG and hyperthyroidism varies, with estimates suggesting that 2–3% of individuals with hyperthyroidism have MG, and 2–17.5% of MG patients experience thyrotoxicosis. Epidemiologically, both conditions exhibit a female predominance, with incidence peaking between 20 and 40 years of age [\nThis patient presented with generalized myasthenia, although hyperthyroidism is more frequently associated with spino-bulbar forms of MG [\nThe thymus plays a significant role in MG, with frequent thymic abnormalities, including follicular hyperplasia in 65% of cases and thymoma in 10–15% [\nThyroid scintigraphy, ultrasonography, and functional tests confirmed Graves’ disease in this patient. Immunologically, ANA positivity in the absence of lupus-specific symptoms was attributed to MG [\nGiven the autoimmune nature of both conditions and their potential for mutual exacerbation, a multidisciplinary approach was essential in managing the patient’s condition. Upon admission, she presented with acute respiratory failure, pharyngeal pain, and rapid respiratory arrest. Emergency intervention was initiated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and Ambu mask ventilation, successfully restoring respiratory function. The administration of Prostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, resulted in symptom reversal, confirming the suspicion of coexisting myasthenia gravis (MG) and Graves’ disease [\nOnce stabilized, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for continuous monitoring of vital signs, neurological status, and respiratory function. Special attention was given to cardiac function and the prevention of potential neurological deficits due to hypoxic injury. To address her Graves’ disease, she was maintained on carbimazole (30 mg daily) to suppress excessive thyroid hormone production and propranolol (20 mg daily) to control hyperadrenergic symptoms such as palpitations and tremors [\nThroughout her hospitalization, her thyroid function was closely monitored to prevent thyrotoxic crises, which could further exacerbate her MG symptoms. Neuromuscular function improved with the continued administration of Prostigmine, and there was no recurrence of severe muscle weakness or evidence of a myasthenic crisis. For long-term management of MG, corticosteroids such as prednisone were considered, though initiated cautiously owing to their potential to transiently worsen symptoms [\nFor severe exacerbations, plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IG) was available as an option to rapidly reduce circulating autoantibodies and improve muscle strength [\nOver the course of 11 days, the patient demonstrated steady clinical improvement, remained hemodynamically stable, and experienced no further respiratory distress or cardiac complications. Given her positive response to treatment, she was discharged with a comprehensive outpatient management plan, including continued antithyroid therapy, beta-blockers, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. In addition, psychological support was recommended to address the psycho-affective distress associated with her chronic illness and personal circumstances. Close follow-up was scheduled to ensure continued symptom control and to prevent disease exacerbation. A multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists, endocrinologists, and intensive care specialists was crucial in optimizing the patient’s management and ensuring long-term stability [\nThe prognosis for co-morbid MG and Graves’ disease varies. In approximately 40% of cases, MG improves while hyperthyroidism worsens; in 20%, thyrotoxicosis is controlled but MG persists [\nThis patient was administered a low dose of corticosteroids to mitigate the risk of transient MG exacerbation associated with steroid initiation. In addition, radioactive iodine therapy was provided. The patient demonstrated improvement and remains under regular follow-up.\nThe co-occurrence of MG and Graves’ disease is not coincidental and should be considered in clinical practice. MG should be suspected in patients with Graves’ disease presenting with ptosis, nystagmus, or persistent myogenic symptoms despite thyroid hormone regulation. Radiological imaging, particularly in conjunction with immunoassays, is critical in diagnosing these conditions and identifying associated thymic pathology, such as thymoma. Prompt recognition and targeted management are essential for optimizing patient outcomes.", "topic": "Neurotransmitter"}

The maintenance of neurological function and cerebral homeostasis critically depends on precisely regulated blood flow within the intricately organized cerebrovascular network. Disruptions in cerebral hemodynamics may impair neurovascular homeostasis, thereby inducing pathophysiological cascades characterized by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal degeneration. Emerging evidence identifies cerebrovascular dysregulation and impaired neurovascular coupling (NVC) as primary pathogenic mechanisms underlying VaD, emphasizing the necessity to elucidate their complex interplay. Cerebrovascular endothelial cells exhibit remarkable heterogeneity, serving dual roles as both architectural components of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and functional regulators of NVC. Furthermore, pericytes residing abluminal on capillary endothelia demonstrate critical involvement in hemodynamic modulation through contractile regulation of microvascular tone, while concurrently maintaining BBB integrity through dynamic paracrine signaling. This study examines cerebrovascular endothelial-neuronal interactions within the neurovascular unit (NVU) framework, analyzing their bidirectional regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic potential in cognitive dysfunction remediation. The pathophysiological progression of VaD manifests through multiple interdependent pathways, including cerebral hypoperfusion, oxidative stress cascades, neuroinflammatory responses, mitochondrial dysregulation, and electrolyte homeostasis perturbations.

To assess nicotine-induced abstinence withdrawal, planarians (N = 6) were exposed to 50 μM nicotine for one hour under control conditions (APW), and then their motility was tested for five minutes as described above.\nCulture-based and microscopic analysis\nFollowing the seven-day antibiotic treatment period, planarians from each group were weighed and then homogenized in APW using sterile, disposable mortar and pestles. The homogenates were serially diluted, then spread-plated onto sterile brain heart infusion (BHI) agar plates, and incubated at room temperature for seven days. After quantifying the number of colonies on each plate, Gram-stained slides of four representative microbes from\nMetagenomic DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) analysis\nDNA was extracted from each of the eight worm homogenates using the PowerBioFilm® DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Inc., Carlsbad, CA). The isolated DNA from each worm group was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 16S primers 338f and 907rev. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified using the forward primer 338_f_GC (5’ - CGC CCG CCG CGC GCG GCG GGC GGG GCG GGG GCA CGG GGG GAC TCC TAC GGG AGG CAG - 3’) (5 μM) and the reverse primer 907r (5’ - CCG TCA ATT CCT TTG AGT TT - 3’) (5 μM) obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). As necessitated for DGGE separation, the forward primer contained a 27-base GC clamp on the 5’ end. Extracted DNA samples were subject to PCR with an initial denaturation step at 94˚C for 10 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 94˚C (30 s), 53˚C (30 s), and 72˚C (45 s) with final extension at 72˚C for seven minutes. Following amplification, samples were loaded onto a DGGE gel with a 70-40% gradient was run for 16 hours at 90 V, then stained with Sybr-gold for the analysis of differences in microbial communities in the different treatment groups.\n16s rDNA library preparation\nDNA extracted from each of the worm homogenates was quantified spectrophotometrically and adjusted to 10 ng of genomic DNA. The 16S barcodes for each sample 1-8 were thawed at room temperature, and then each tube was individually mixed. Once vortexed, the 16S barcodes were kept on ice as PCR reactions were set up as follows to create the barcoded library as specified by the manufacturer, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Oxford, UK).\nThe eight barcoded samples were amplified using the following PCR conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for one minute, followed by 25 cycles, each with 20 seconds of denaturation at 95 °C, annealing at 55 °C for 30 seconds, and extension at 65 °C for two minutes, with one final extension at 65 °C for five minutes. PCR-amplified samples were transferred to fresh tubes, and 30 ul of AMPure XP beads were mixed for five minutes at room temperature. Tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 seconds and then placed on a magnet to immobilize beads. Samples were washed with 200 uL of 70% ethanol, then centrifuged for 30 seconds, and placed back onto the magnet. Pellets were air-dried prior to resuspension in 10 uL of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, with 50 mM NaCl at room temperature for two minutes. In a single 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, each of the eight barcoded libraries was pooled in the appropriate ratios to a total of 100 fmoles, and 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 50 mM NaCl was added, reaching a total volume of 10 uL. One (1) uL of the rapid adapter RAP was pooled with the library and mixed, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for five minutes.\nMinION 16s rDNA sequence analysis\nThe sequencing buffer (SQB), loading beads (LB), flush tether (FLT), and one tube of flush buffer (FB) were thawed at room temperature and then kept on ice.

(A) Exposure to ampicillin (1 mg/mL), kanamycin (1 mg/mL), or both ampicillin and kanamycin, both at 1 mg/mL has no effect on planarian velocity, consistent with the results shown in Figure\nAs shown in Figure\nThe antibiotics ampicillin and kanamycin, either independently or in combination, had no effect on normal planarian activity. Therefore, we continued to investigate the potential effect of microbiome alteration by the two antibiotics ampicillin (a ß-lactam) and kanamycin (a non-ß-lactam). Metagenomic analysis indicated that antibiotic treatment reduced the diversity and quantity of detectable bacterial populations in treated planarians. We therefore proceeded to test the potential effect of microbiome alteration on abstinence-induced nicotine withdrawal in an established planarian model [\nPlanarians that were pretreated in APW and then tested in APW without ampicillin displayed a normal motility velocity, a control that indicates that there was no change in normal activity over the observation period. Planarians that were pretreated in APW and then tested in APW with kanamycin displayed a normal motility velocity, a control that indicates that kanamycin did not alter normal activity over the observation period. Planarians that were pretreated in APW and then tested in APW with kanamycin displayed a normal motility velocity, a control that indicates that kanamycin did not alter normal activity over the observation period. Planarians that were pretreated in APW and then tested in APW containing ampicillin plus kanamycin displayed normal motility velocity, a control that indicates that a combination of ampicillin plus kanamycin did not alter normal activity over the observation period. There was no significant difference among these control groups, so we proceeded. Planarians that were pretreated with nicotine and then tested in APW without antibiotics displayed a significant reduction in motility, a finding that extensive previous work has demonstrated is a rigorous model of abstinence-induced withdrawal in the planarian model [\nTaken together, the results indicate that a ß-lactam broad-spectrum antibiotic (ampicillin) prevents abstinence-induced withdrawal from nicotine, but a non-ß-lactam broad-spectrum antibiotic (kanamycin) does not. It is unclear why the combination did not have an effect. One possibility is that the combination effectively gave the worms a double dose of antibiotic, effectively antagonizing ampicillin’s effect. Note that this does not reflect on clinical activity; it only reports the findings of nicotine withdrawal using the protocol of this test system.\nIn retrospect, there is a possible prior indication in the literature that antibiotics can affect the withdrawal behavior in planarians. Specifically, Rawls et al. [\nThe current study has limitations. Although we attribute the effect of ampicillin on alleviating nicotine withdrawal to changes in the microbiome, it has not conclusively been proven. Further study is required to determine if changes in microbiome alone, transporters, or some combination of the two result in behavioral changes after only one hour versus a week of exposure. Other limitations include small sample sizes, potential confounding effects, and follow-up that specific bands of DNA are GC-rich with molecular evidence (e.g., sequencing or composition analysis). Hopefully, future work will address these gaps to strengthen generalizability.\nThis study aimed to determine if microbiome alteration using antibiotics modulates nicotine withdrawal behavior in planarians.

In addition, we measured the body mass index (BMI), which is measured by the formula BMI = weight in kilograms/height in centimeters² ² Calculated formula [\nWe also conducted interviews with the patients to evaluate their clinical symptoms.

Laboratory tests on fasting blood samples revealed that HDL-C levels were lower, while TSH, FBG, TC, LDL-C, and TG levels were higher in the SAPS group compared to the non-SAPS group. Additionally, both SBP and DBP were higher in the SAPS group. These results are summarized in Table\n\nDemographic and general clinical data of different clinical subgroups\nBefore conducting binary multivariate logistic regression analyses, we performed correlation analyses on the two-by-two variables. When the VIF values of all independent variables were less than 2, it indicated that the multicollinearity problem was mild.

All |r| are less than 0.7: the correlation coefficients between the variables are usually considered low [\n\nSpearman correlation analysis between variables\nWe performed a binary multivariate logistic regression analysis with SAPS comorbidity as the dependent variable and variables with VIF < 2 (HAMA, CGI-SI, FBG, Age, Education, TSH, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG) as independent variables. HAMA score (OR = 1.643), CGI-SI score (OR = 8.359), and TSH level (OR = 2.025) were significantly associated with SAPS.

First, its cross-sectional design precludes conclusions about causality. Although associations were found between anxiety severity, illness severity, thyroid function, and SAPS in FEDN MDD patients, the temporal sequence remains unclear. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify causal pathways. Second, the sample was limited to first-episode, drug-naïve Han Chinese patients in Shanxi Province, China. While this restriction minimizes medication-related confounding factors, it also limits the generalizability of the findings. Future research should include more diverse MDD populations. Third, critical psychosocial factors—such as adverse life events [\nIn conclusion, our study explored the prevalence of comorbid SAPS in patients with FEDN MDD and reported that higher HAMA scores, higher CGI-SI scores, and higher TSH levels were positively correlated with comorbid SAPS in FEDN MDD patients.

We first collected sociodemographic information about the patients, including age, gender, age of onset, total disease duration, education level, and marital status. In addition, we measured the body mass index (BMI), which is measured by the formula BMI = weight in kilograms/height in centimeters² ² Calculated formula [\nWe also conducted interviews with the patients to evaluate their clinical symptoms. Before the start of the study, two psychiatrists with at least five years of clinical experience were trained in four assessment scales: the Positive Symptom Scale (PSS), the HAMD-17 Scale, the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-SI) [\nTwo trained clinicians independently conducted the scale evaluations during the study to maintain the reliability and consistency of the assessments. Both clinicians were blinded to the patient’s clinical status. The inter-rater correlation coefficients for the HAMD, HAMA, and PSS scores exceeded 0.8 between the two psychiatrists.\nAll participants provided fasting blood samples after at least 8 h of fasting, between 7:00 and 10:00 AM. Venous blood was drawn into serum separator tubes and immediately placed on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min within 1 h of collection, and the serum was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until analysis.\nThyroid function indicators, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT\nQuality control procedures included daily instrument calibration and standard reference materials. All assays were duplicated, and the mean values were recorded to ensure reliability.\nFinally, we investigated the presence or absence of SA among participants through interviews. We asked all participants the same question: “To date, have you attempted suicide?” [\nFEDN MDD patients with a history of SA within two weeks before the interview and a PSS score greater than 15 were clustered as the SAPS subgroup, while other patients were clustered as the non-SAPS group.\nInitially, a Quantile-Quantile plot was employed in the comparative analysis of demographic and clinical variables to assess the normality of data distribution. Independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests were subsequently used to determine the differences between the groups. Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) were computed to address the multicollinearity problem between the auto-covariates. Only variables with a VIF below two [\nA total of 1,718 FEDN MDD patients participated in this study, of which 4.4% (76/1,718) were diagnosed with SAPS. Patients in the SAPS group were generally older at the onset of the study than those in the non-SAPS group. The SAPS group also had a lower average education level than the non-SAPS group. Laboratory tests on fasting blood samples revealed that HDL-C levels were lower, while TSH, FBG, TC, LDL-C, and TG levels were higher in the SAPS group compared to the non-SAPS group. Additionally, both SBP and DBP were higher in the SAPS group. These results are summarized in Table\n\nDemographic and general clinical data of different clinical subgroups\nBefore conducting binary multivariate logistic regression analyses, we performed correlation analyses on the two-by-two variables. When the VIF values of all independent variables were less than 2, it indicated that the multicollinearity problem was mild. For further validation, we checked the matrix of correlation coefficients between the variables, with a maximum |r| of 0.455. All |r| are less than 0.7: the correlation coefficients between the variables are usually considered low [\n\nSpearman correlation analysis between variables\nWe performed a binary multivariate logistic regression analysis with SAPS comorbidity as the dependent variable and variables with VIF < 2 (HAMA, CGI-SI, FBG, Age, Education, TSH, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG) as independent variables. HAMA score (OR = 1.643), CGI-SI score (OR = 8.359), and TSH level (OR = 2.025) were significantly associated with SAPS. These findings indicate that higher anxiety severity, greater overall illness severity, and abnormal thyroid function are important risk factors for SAPS in FEDN MDD patients. The model’s Nagelkerke R² was 0.708, suggesting strong explanatory and predictive power. Clinically, these indicators may aid in early identification and targeted intervention. Full results are presented in Table\n\nBinary logistic regression analyses of determinants of SAPS in FEDN MDD patients\nNagelkerke R² = 0.708\nWe conducted a ROC curve analysis using factors that significantly influenced the risk of SAPS in the binary logistic regression analysis. Specifically, the area under the curve (AUC) for HAMA scores was the highest at 0.955; the AUC for CGI-SI scores was 0.866; and the TSH levels were 0.929. The AUC for the combined ROC curve of the three factors was 0.980 (Table\nThe discriminatory power of related factors for distinguishing patients with SAPS in MDD\nROC analysis for identifying MDD Patients with SAPS\nRelevant factors for discriminating patients with MDD combined with SAPS. CGI-SI: Clinical Global Impression Scale- Severity of Illness; TSH: thyroid-stimulating hormone; HAMA: Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale.\nThis study explored the prevalence of comorbid SAPS and the related factors in FEDN MDD patients. The key findings were as follows: [\nWe found that the prevalence of comorbid SAPS among FEDN MDD patients was approximately 4.4%, much higher than the 0.36% prevalence in the general population [\nIn addition, we found that thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are positively associated with developing SAPS. An observational study showed that even small changes in thyroid function are strongly related to the risk of developing MDD [\nHAMA and CGI-SI scores were also significantly and positively associated with co-morbid SAPS in our target population. A recent study found that there is a significant association between anxiety symptoms and the increased risk of suicidal behavior in patients with FEDN MDD in the early stages of the disease [\nFinally, we found that HAMA, CGI-SI, and TSH levels are highly diagnostic of both SA and PS in our target population [\nThis study has several limitations. First, its cross-sectional design precludes conclusions about causality. Although associations were found between anxiety severity, illness severity, thyroid function, and SAPS in FEDN MDD patients, the temporal sequence remains unclear. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify causal pathways. Second, the sample was limited to first-episode, drug-naïve Han Chinese patients in Shanxi Province, China. While this restriction minimizes medication-related confounding factors, it also limits the generalizability of the findings. Future research should include more diverse MDD populations. Third, critical psychosocial factors—such as adverse life events [\nIn conclusion, our study explored the prevalence of comorbid SAPS in patients with FEDN MDD and reported that higher HAMA scores, higher CGI-SI scores, and higher TSH levels were positively correlated with comorbid SAPS in FEDN MDD patients. The clinical significance of this study lies in the ability to effectively predict the risk of comorbid SAPS among patients with first-episode major depression by identifying specific thresholds for HAMA scores, CGI-SI scores, and TSH levels, thereby facilitating early-stage intervention and better patient prognosis.", "topic": "Neurotransmitter"}

Sphingolipidoses, such as acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), are a group of lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the accumulation of sphingolipids in lysosomes due to a defect of a lysosomal hydrolase—or, in rare cases, an activator protein—that is necessary for catabolism of sphingolipids [\nThe accumulation of lipids in NPC has a wide range of devastating consequences for the NPC1-deficient cells. For example, the pH rises in the NPC1-deficient lysosomal lumen in an elusive mechanism. Under normal conditions, the lysosome has a pH of around 4.5-5.0 [\nWhile the accumulated lipids in the cellular organelles are detrimental, the potentially reduced availability of these lipids, especially unesterified cholesterol in other subcellular structures, is also contributing to NPC disease pathophysiology. A previous study reported that the primary cilia length was significantly shortened in\nSimilar to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease and other lysosomal storage disorders, neuroinflammation has been reported in multiple studies in NPC [\nIndividuals with NPC present with a wide range of systemic and neurological manifestations that are not unique to the disease, arise at different ages, and progress at different rates. Based on multiple studies, the clinical presentation of NPC can be categorized according to age at onset of neurological manifestations into four categories: early-infantile, late-infantile, juvenile, and adult-onset [\nIn the early-infantile form (neurological onset between 2 months to 2 years of age), individuals with NPC often present with developmental delay and hypotonia; additionally, dysarthria, dysphagia, cataplexy, dystonia, and spasticity are also present in some of the NPC individuals [\nNPC disease is not only a neurodegenerative disease, but it is also accompanied by systemic manifestations, especially in the early and late-infantile forms of NPC [\nLipids are one of the fundamental building blocks for living cells and play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases [\nLipids have a complex and diverse structure, resulting in unique properties and functions. Due to this chemical diversity in the structure and functional groups of lipid molecules, analysis and quantification of lipids have been challenging. There are several traditional methods for the detection and quantification of lipids based on their chemical properties. These methods often include fluorescence-active dye molecules [\nNPC disease was conceptualized as a cellular cholesterol dysregulation disorder, due to the discovery of cholesterol esterification defects in NPC skin fibroblasts by Pentchev et al. in 1985 [\nFilipin is a naturally fluorescent antifungal antibiotic consisting of a lactone ring with conjugated double bonds isolated from\nBesides the clinical application of filipin to support the diagnosis of NPC disease, it is also utilized in many laboratories as a marker for labeling and quantifying free cholesterol in cells and tissues [\nPerfringolysin O (PFO) is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin secreted by the bacteria\nThin-layer chromatography (TLC) separation is based on two major components: (a) a stationary phase, mostly silica, and (b) a mobile phase, mostly organic solvent mixtures. Researchers have utilized TLC for the separation and detection of major lipids, including phospholipids and cholesterol [\nThe aforementioned traditional methods are useful in detecting cholesterol accumulation in NPC-deficient cells and tissues; however, they do not have the capacity to provide a comprehensive overview of the alteration of other lipids on a broader scale. For example, these traditional methods only provide limited structural information about the lipids that are biologically important. When using lipid staining methods such as filipin staining, the specificity of the binding determines the accuracy of lipid detection. Filipin is known to recognize both cholesterol and ganglioside GM1 with a similar affinity, while it also presents a weak affinity towards phospholipids [\nFurthermore, most traditional methods for lipid detection rely on labeling methods such as radiolabeling or reporter systems. While labeling techniques improve the specificity of detection, these methods do not detect endogenous lipids. Enzymatic activity-based lipid detection methods, such as cholesterol esterification tests, can only be conducted in live cells. This limits the application of these methods in animal tissues or human postmortem tissues, which provide more insights into disease research. Therefore, very few laboratories currently perform this type of diagnosis for the clinical diagnosis of NPC disease.\nIn lipid research, measuring a single lipid or a few lipids does not provide a clear picture of alterations in the global lipidome. To gain a thorough understanding of the lipidome, it is crucial to map multiple lipid classes and lipid species. However, apart from the TLC technique, the above-discussed traditional methods often do not provide information on multiple lipid classes. Even though the TLC method provides information on multiple lipid classes, it does not specify crucial lipid information, including chain length and unsaturation level. Due to the limitations of the traditional methods, more advanced techniques are needed to explore the changes in as many lipid species as possible in the context of NPC disease, such as state-of-the-art mass spectrometry (MS). MS-based lipidomics has gained more attention due to its ability to overcome these noted challenges.\nMS is a technique that generates positively or negatively charged ions from analyte molecules, separates them based on their mass-to-charge ratio (\nMS-based lipidomics can provide quantitative information in both targeted and untargeted lipid analyses. Commonly, a targeted approach quantifies known lipids using specific standards and calibration curves with greater sensitivity, whereas an untargeted approach detects hundreds to thousands of lipids, providing semi-quantitative data. Each method has its strengths and limitations, and the choice depends on the specific research question(s), sample type, and desired level of quantification and lipid coverage. Several MS-based methods are available for the quantitative analysis of lipids, each with its own advantages [\n\nQuadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF)\nIn MS-based lipidomics, using more than one mass analyzer in combination, i.e., termed hybrid MS, plays a crucial role due to its ability to provide detailed information on analyte molecules and the efficiency of analysis. In Q-TOF instruments, two mass analyzers, a quadrupole and a Time-of-flight (TOF), are used in tandem. A quadrupole consists of four parallel rods positioned equidistant from the center and operates as a mass filter. The ions are filtered by scanning both direct current (DC) and alternating current or radio frequency (RF) voltages applied to these quadrupoles. Due to the DC and RF voltages on the quadrupole, ions passing through oscillate while moving forward, creating a “corkscrew” trajectory. Based upon this phenomenon, only a specific\nThe TOF mass analyzer operates based on the principle that molecules with different\n\nQuadrupole-Orbitrap\nThe quadrupole-Orbitrap configuration is another hybrid instrument platform commonly used in MS-based lipidomics analysis. In these instruments, the first mass analyzer is a quadrupole that operates as a mass filter and an ion guide, while the second mass analyzer is an Orbitrap that provides high mass resolution and accuracy. The Orbitrap mass analyzer consists of three electrodes, where a spindle-shaped central electrode is engulfed by a cup-shaped pair of other electrodes facing each other [\n\nTriple quadrupole mass spectrometers\nTriple quadrupole mass spectrometers (TQ-MS or QQQ) generally consist of three quadrupole mass filters in series, where the second quadrupole functions as a collision cell. While the mass accuracy and mass resolution of TQ-MS are lower than most other MS instruments, these instruments provide outstanding sensitivity and specificity. The high sensitivity of this technique allows the detection of low-concentration analytes, such as signaling lipids, including sphingolipids [\n\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) combines a laser-based ionization technique and one or two TOF mass analyzers. In MALDI, a laser desorbs and ionizes analytes on a flat surface, such as a stainless-steel plate, indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass slides, or regular glass slides, depending on the instrument requirement. The TOF mass analyzer will then analyze these ionized analytes. Hybrid mass analyzers, including Q-TOF, are combined with the MALDI ionization technique as well. While MALDI is not ideal for use in LC-MS, it has been more popular in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) [\n\nShotgun lipidomics\nTraditionally, lipid analysis via MS was done by directly injecting the lipid extract into the mass spectrometer without prior chromatographic separation [\n\nLiquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS) in lipidomics\nLiquid chromatography is a valuable technique that can separate analyte molecules prior to detection. Depending on the application, a number of LC columns with different column chemistries are available. In lipidomics using LC-MS, the most frequently used column chemistries are reversed-phase, such as non-polar C18 (an 18-carbon chain that is bonded to silica gel) and a variation of normal phase chromatography known as hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) [\nThe clinical presentation of NPC, the onset of neurological manifestations, and disease progression are highly heterogeneous. With the broad phenotypic spectrum and disease onset variability, it is crucial to understand the disease pathophysiology, monitor disease progression, and response to pharmacological intervention [\nDue to the rarity of NPC disease, non-specific early symptoms, variability in disease onset/clinical presentation, and the complexity of laboratory testing, early diagnosis of NPC has been extremely challenging. In a 2013 study, filipin staining showed insufficient sensitivity in a subset of patients, particularly patients early in the disease process, showcasing the need for better diagnostic tools [\nBlood-based lipid biomarker identification by MS has significantly surpassed the traditional filipin staining test by multiple advantages, including noninvasiveness, rapidity, high-throughput capability, and lower cost. Moreover, biomarker testing is more time and cost-effective than genetic testing. These lipid biomarkers represent significant advancements in NPC diagnostics in the past few years. Their application in rapid and sensitive clinical testing has reduced some of the challenges associated with developing and gaining regulatory approval for new treatments. Blood-based assay for NPC has been implemented in more than 50 clinical laboratories worldwide and recommended as a first-line tool in the NPC diagnostic algorithm [\nCholesterol oxidation products (termed oxysterols) have emerged as a first-line screening tool for NPC [\nExtending from GC-MS strategies to LC-MS, Boenzi et al. first developed a sensitive LC-ESI-MS/MS method to quantify the oxysterols in plasma as dimethylaminobutyrate ester in 2014 [\nIn contrast, cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (C-triol) is one of the most well-established oxysterol biomarkers for NPC, with the largest evidence base and more widespread application in clinical laboratories worldwide [\nDue to the above-mentioned characteristics of this oxysterol, C-triol is now the preferred robust first-line diagnostic test for NPC [\n7-ketocholesterol (7-KC), made from the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol into 7-ketocholesterol with cholesterol-7,8-epoxide as a side product, is a toxic oxysterol associated with many diseases and aging. 7-KC is another oxysterol that was deemed a potential blood-based diagnostic biomarker for NPC and was confirmed in multiple cohort studies [\nIn addition to the oxidation products, cholesterol esterification from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and unesterified cholesterol from both PBMCs and skin biopsy samples have also been assessed as biomarkers by LC-MS/MS in a 2020 cohort study with 31 NPC individuals [\nSphingolipids are highly bioactive lipid species important to both the structural integrity of eukaryotic cells and signaling. Importantly, sphingolipids are enriched in the CNS and play a crucial role in brain development, myelination, and the regulation of apoptosis [\nIn 2014, Welford et al. reported that the plasma concentration of lysosphingomyelin (Lyso-SM), also known as sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), a deacylated derivative of sphingomyelin and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph), can be used as a diagnostic biomarker for NPC and can differentiate between NPC and ASMD [\nAlthough Lyso-SM and Lyso-SM-509 are elevated in both NPC and ASMD, they are often more significantly elevated in ASMD and marginally elevated in NPC [\nAs lysosphingolipids can distinguish between ASMD and NPC and have also been shown to correlate with disease onset and severity, they are strong biomarkers for NPC. However, A study by Kuchar et al. suggests that the plasma but not dried blood spots levels of Lyso-SM and Lyso-SM-509 allow differential biochemical screening of ASMD and NPC [\nBased on these differences, multiple studies have raised the possibility that NPC diagnosis and disease monitoring can be best assessed by tracking the elevation of multiple lipid biomarkers in multiplexed assays, rather than monitoring a single biomarker [\n\n\nStern et al. recently reviewed the landscape of pharmacodynamic biomarkers currently used for disease monitoring and treatment response in patients with NPC [\nIn NPC, there is a general trend in which the earlier neurological onset form of the disease progresses faster and more severely than those that display later neurological deficits [\nIn addition to the better-known “classical” NPC lipid biomarkers, other lipid species have become of growing interest in NPC research, perhaps linked to secondary lipid accumulation due to lysosomal defects [\nIn a similar manner, several cellular models of NPC, including CHO, COS-7, and human NPC primary fibroblast, similarly show severe accumulation of specific sphingomyelin species [\nMore recent efforts have been placed in utilizing LC-MS for measuring cholesterol and cholesterol-derived species in NPC disease models. In 2016, glucosylated cholesterol, which is far more water soluble than cholesterol, was measured by LC-MS/MS in several lysosomal storage disorders, including NPC disease, and showed striking accumulation in the liver of NPC animal models. A similar observation was made with the induction of lysosomal cholesterol accumulation using the NPC1 pharmacological inhibitor U18666A, which suggests that excess cholesterol accumulation in the lysosomal lumen increases the formation of glucosylated cholesterol [\nAn interesting study in 2019 demonstrated significantly cleared cholesterol storage in NPC1-deficient cells as well as in the liver of\nThese studies showcase the ongoing progress in utilizing MS to delve deeper into the pathophysiology of NPC disease, to include a broader spectrum of lipid metabolism disruption. Mass spectrometry, particularly LC-MS/MS, has played a pivotal role in revealing a complex, systemic secondary lipidome dysregulation in NPC, such as increased cellular levels of ceramides, gangliosides, and arachidonic acid. Recent advances have also focused on measuring cholesterol derivatives such as cholesteryl esters and glucosylated cholesterol, which show potential as cellular markers. Overall, MS-based lipidomics has been crucial for understanding NPC pathophysiology and identifying new potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.\nMSI has become an exceedingly successful tool for mapping the spatial distribution of biologically relevant molecules in tissues. Compared with conventional imaging methods, MSI enables the untargeted imaging of many compounds in a single analysis without the need for any tags or labeling [\nCholesterol attracts high interest not only in NPC disease but across a broad range of biomedical research and areas of human health and disease. However, due to its low ionization efficiency, cholesterol analysis with MS presents specific challenges. To improve the ionization of molecules such as cholesterol, several derivatization strategies have been developed [\nIn addition to cholesterol, the spatial distribution of several other lipid classes has been studied in the context of NPC disease. Phosphoinositide species have also been imaged in the cerebellum of the\nThe field of lipidomics has incorporated many of these advances, in particular in quantitative lipid analysis at the single-cell level and lipid imaging at subcellular resolution. Lipidome analysis at the single-cell level is an exciting emerging technique in the field, although the methodologies are still underdeveloped and present many challenges [\nBeyond lipidomics studies in NPC disease, as discussed in the present review, other omics studies, including proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics, have significantly advanced our understanding of NPC. Technological innovations, such as isobaric labeling-based quantitative proteomics, high-resolution mass spectrometry for untargeted and targeted metabolomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing for transcriptomic profiling, have enabled high-throughput, sensitive, and systems-level analyses of NPC-related molecular dysregulation [\nOne of the inherent challenges of rare diseases is the small population size, which means that readily available information or resources are less accessible. Recent technological advancements may allow researchers to streamline part of this challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an increasingly available tool for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. This is especially promising for the study of rare diseases such as NPC. Incorporating AI can assist us in circumventing some conventional limitations associated with rare diseases. Examples include optimizing traditional randomized control trials [\nTechnological advancements in daily-use devices such as smartphones and wearable devices such as smartwatches have introduced a new category of biomarkers referred to as “digital biomarkers”. The ability of these devices to collect many measurements in real-time with relevant ease can provide us with a large body of information about an individual’s health [\nLipidomics has become an essential approach for elucidating the lipid abnormalities characteristic of NPC disease. MS has continuously evolved over the past few decades, with emerging techniques and advancements in instrumentation pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Advances in MS technologies, particularly in resolution, sensitivity, and quantitative capabilities, have significantly enhanced our ability to profile complex lipidomes and uncover disease-specific biomarkers. As highlighted in this review, these MS-driven lipidomics strategies offer valuable insights into NPC pathophysiology and hold promise for the development of targeted diagnostics and therapeutics. Moreover, the broader application of MS across various disease areas, including metabolic, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular disorders, underscores its growing impact as a versatile platform for disease research and precision medicine. In addition to ongoing innovations aimed at improving resolution, mass accuracy, and sensitivity through advances in ionization techniques, mass analyzers, and hybrid systems, significant improvements in data processing algorithms and data analysis software contributed to the transformative potential of MS in biomedical research.", "content_for_embedding": "Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease with an estimated incidence in Western Europeans of 1 in 100,000 [\nNPC disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disease.

With the broad phenotypic spectrum and disease onset variability, it is crucial to understand the disease pathophysiology, monitor disease progression, and response to pharmacological intervention [\nDue to the rarity of NPC disease, non-specific early symptoms, variability in disease onset/clinical presentation, and the complexity of laboratory testing, early diagnosis of NPC has been extremely challenging. In a 2013 study, filipin staining showed insufficient sensitivity in a subset of patients, particularly patients early in the disease process, showcasing the need for better diagnostic tools [\nBlood-based lipid biomarker identification by MS has significantly surpassed the traditional filipin staining test by multiple advantages, including noninvasiveness, rapidity, high-throughput capability, and lower cost. Moreover, biomarker testing is more time and cost-effective than genetic testing. These lipid biomarkers represent significant advancements in NPC diagnostics in the past few years. Their application in rapid and sensitive clinical testing has reduced some of the challenges associated with developing and gaining regulatory approval for new treatments. Blood-based assay for NPC has been implemented in more than 50 clinical laboratories worldwide and recommended as a first-line tool in the NPC diagnostic algorithm [\nCholesterol oxidation products (termed oxysterols) have emerged as a first-line screening tool for NPC [\nExtending from GC-MS strategies to LC-MS, Boenzi et al. first developed a sensitive LC-ESI-MS/MS method to quantify the oxysterols in plasma as dimethylaminobutyrate ester in 2014 [\nIn contrast, cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (C-triol) is one of the most well-established oxysterol biomarkers for NPC, with the largest evidence base and more widespread application in clinical laboratories worldwide [\nDue to the above-mentioned characteristics of this oxysterol, C-triol is now the preferred robust first-line diagnostic test for NPC [\n7-ketocholesterol (7-KC), made from the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol into 7-ketocholesterol with cholesterol-7,8-epoxide as a side product, is a toxic oxysterol associated with many diseases and aging. 7-KC is another oxysterol that was deemed a potential blood-based diagnostic biomarker for NPC and was confirmed in multiple cohort studies [\nIn addition to the oxidation products, cholesterol esterification from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and unesterified cholesterol from both PBMCs and skin biopsy samples have also been assessed as biomarkers by LC-MS/MS in a 2020 cohort study with 31 NPC individuals [\nSphingolipids are highly bioactive lipid species important to both the structural integrity of eukaryotic cells and signaling. Importantly, sphingolipids are enriched in the CNS and play a crucial role in brain development, myelination, and the regulation of apoptosis [\nIn 2014, Welford et al. reported that the plasma concentration of lysosphingomyelin (Lyso-SM), also known as sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), a deacylated derivative of sphingomyelin and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph), can be used as a diagnostic biomarker for NPC and can differentiate between NPC and ASMD [\nAlthough Lyso-SM and Lyso-SM-509 are elevated in both NPC and ASMD, they are often more significantly elevated in ASMD and marginally elevated in NPC [\nAs lysosphingolipids can distinguish between ASMD and NPC and have also been shown to correlate with disease onset and severity, they are strong biomarkers for NPC. However, A study by Kuchar et al. suggests that the plasma but not dried blood spots levels of Lyso-SM and Lyso-SM-509 allow differential biochemical screening of ASMD and NPC [\nBased on these differences, multiple studies have raised the possibility that NPC diagnosis and disease monitoring can be best assessed by tracking the elevation of multiple lipid biomarkers in multiplexed assays, rather than monitoring a single biomarker [\n\n\nStern et al. recently reviewed the landscape of pharmacodynamic biomarkers currently used for disease monitoring and treatment response in patients with NPC [\nIn NPC, there is a general trend in which the earlier neurological onset form of the disease progresses faster and more severely than those that display later neurological deficits [\nIn addition to the better-known “classical” NPC lipid biomarkers, other lipid species have become of growing interest in NPC research, perhaps linked to secondary lipid accumulation due to lysosomal defects [\nIn a similar manner, several cellular models of NPC, including CHO, COS-7, and human NPC primary fibroblast, similarly show severe accumulation of specific sphingomyelin species [\nMore recent efforts have been placed in utilizing LC-MS for measuring cholesterol and cholesterol-derived species in NPC disease models. In 2016, glucosylated cholesterol, which is far more water soluble than cholesterol, was measured by LC-MS/MS in several lysosomal storage disorders, including NPC disease, and showed striking accumulation in the liver of NPC animal models. A similar observation was made with the induction of lysosomal cholesterol accumulation using the NPC1 pharmacological inhibitor U18666A, which suggests that excess cholesterol accumulation in the lysosomal lumen increases the formation of glucosylated cholesterol [\nAn interesting study in 2019 demonstrated significantly cleared cholesterol storage in NPC1-deficient cells as well as in the liver of\nThese studies showcase the ongoing progress in utilizing MS to delve deeper into the pathophysiology of NPC disease, to include a broader spectrum of lipid metabolism disruption. Mass spectrometry, particularly LC-MS/MS, has played a pivotal role in revealing a complex, systemic secondary lipidome dysregulation in NPC, such as increased cellular levels of ceramides, gangliosides, and arachidonic acid. Recent advances have also focused on measuring cholesterol derivatives such as cholesteryl esters and glucosylated cholesterol, which show potential as cellular markers. Overall, MS-based lipidomics has been crucial for understanding NPC pathophysiology and identifying new potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.\nMSI has become an exceedingly successful tool for mapping the spatial distribution of biologically relevant molecules in tissues. Compared with conventional imaging methods, MSI enables the untargeted imaging of many compounds in a single analysis without the need for any tags or labeling [\nCholesterol attracts high interest not only in NPC disease but across a broad range of biomedical research and areas of human health and disease. However, due to its low ionization efficiency, cholesterol analysis with MS presents specific challenges. To improve the ionization of molecules such as cholesterol, several derivatization strategies have been developed [\nIn addition to cholesterol, the spatial distribution of several other lipid classes has been studied in the context of NPC disease. Phosphoinositide species have also been imaged in the cerebellum of the\nThe field of lipidomics has incorporated many of these advances, in particular in quantitative lipid analysis at the single-cell level and lipid imaging at subcellular resolution. Lipidome analysis at the single-cell level is an exciting emerging technique in the field, although the methodologies are still underdeveloped and present many challenges [\nBeyond lipidomics studies in NPC disease, as discussed in the present review, other omics studies, including proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics, have significantly advanced our understanding of NPC. Technological innovations, such as isobaric labeling-based quantitative proteomics, high-resolution mass spectrometry for untargeted and targeted metabolomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing for transcriptomic profiling, have enabled high-throughput, sensitive, and systems-level analyses of NPC-related molecular dysregulation [\nOne of the inherent challenges of rare diseases is the small population size, which means that readily available information or resources are less accessible. Recent technological advancements may allow researchers to streamline part of this challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an increasingly available tool for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. This is especially promising for the study of rare diseases such as NPC. Incorporating AI can assist us in circumventing some conventional limitations associated with rare diseases. Examples include optimizing traditional randomized control trials [\nTechnological advancements in daily-use devices such as smartphones and wearable devices such as smartwatches have introduced a new category of biomarkers referred to as “digital biomarkers”. The ability of these devices to collect many measurements in real-time with relevant ease can provide us with a large body of information about an individual’s health [\nLipidomics has become an essential approach for elucidating the lipid abnormalities characteristic of NPC disease. MS has continuously evolved over the past few decades, with emerging techniques and advancements in instrumentation pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Advances in MS technologies, particularly in resolution, sensitivity, and quantitative capabilities, have significantly enhanced our ability to profile complex lipidomes and uncover disease-specific biomarkers. As highlighted in this review, these MS-driven lipidomics strategies offer valuable insights into NPC pathophysiology and hold promise for the development of targeted diagnostics and therapeutics. Moreover, the broader application of MS across various disease areas, including metabolic, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular disorders, underscores its growing impact as a versatile platform for disease research and precision medicine. In addition to ongoing innovations aimed at improving resolution, mass accuracy, and sensitivity through advances in ionization techniques, mass analyzers, and hybrid systems, significant improvements in data processing algorithms and data analysis software contributed to the transformative potential of MS in biomedical research.", "topic": "Neurotransmitter"}
