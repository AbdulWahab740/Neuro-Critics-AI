In patients with DRE, epilepsy surgery, including neuromodulation, may lead to improved seizure control and a reduction in systemic TRAE from ASMs.\nThis case report describes a patient with drug-resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) who, after a relatively short course of CLB therapy experienced persistently excessive somnolence correlated with persistently elevated N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB) levels. Pharmacogenetic testing revealed poor metabolism of CYP2C19, and N-CLB levels remained elevated and detectable for nearly one year after the discontinuation of treatment with CLB and CNB. Responsive neurostimulator (RNS) implantation within the bilateral centromedian nuclei (CMN) of the thalamus resulted in seizure freedom until N-CLB levels fell, after which there was an 83–93 % reduction in the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTC).\nThe patient is a 26-year-old left-handed female with a history of drug-resistant generalized epilepsy manifesting as typical absence seizures (TA) and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTC). Her seizures began around the age of 12 years old with recurrent TA. Initial treatments with ethosuximide, and then levetiracetam, were not efficacious. Then at the age of 19 years old, she developed GTC. During this time, EEG revealed generalized, frontally predominant, 3 Hz, spike-and-wave discharges. A brain MRI was unremarkable for discrete epileptic lesions. Considering her history, semiology, and diagnostic studies, she was diagnosed with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and the electroclinical syndrome, juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) (\nA–D: Scalp EEG. This figure provides representative scalp EEG epileptiform abnormalities from inpatient video-EEG monitoring. A–C are 15 s epochs of EEG, while\nDespite several antiseizure medication (ASM) trials, including valproate, zonisamide, lamotrigine, brivaracetam, perampanel, lacosamide, and pharmacologic grade cannabidiol, she continued to experience frequent seizures. Additionally, she experienced several treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) from these medications.\nShe was followed in the Corewell Health William Beaumont University Hospital Adult Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and presented to the Emergency Department in early summer 2023 after a breakthrough GTC. Before this seizure and her hospital admission to the hospital, her case had been presented and reviewed at the patient management conference. There was a consensus to proceed with responsive neurostimulator (RNS) implantation with depth electrodes targeting bilateral centromedian nuclei (CMN) of the thalamus.\nAt the time of her admission, her ASM regimen consisted of lamotrigine (LTG) monotherapy with a dose of 700 mg daily. Her baseline seizure frequency was reported as multiple TA per day and 3–7 (average of 5) GTC per month. During the admission, given her ongoing seizures, treatment with clobazam (CLB) was initiated (10 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks, then 20 mg at bedtime). No changes were made to her LTG dose.\nIncreasing daytime somnolence was noted at a follow-up visit one month later. Due to ongoing seizures, CLB was titrated in stepwise fashion every 2 weeks to 40 mg nightly. Approximately one month later, and 2 months after beginning treatment with CLB, responsive neurostimulator (RNS) targeting bilateral CMN was implanted.\nAt the time of RNS implantation, excessive somnolence was reported by her family such that she was sleeping nearly 20 h per day. It was clinically suspected that her somnolence was CLB-related. As such, a transition was initiated from CLB to cenobamate (CNB).\nClobazam dose.\nUnfortunately, somnolence persisted during the CNB titration and after achieving a CNB dose of 200 mg nightly. Although she continued to experience excessive somnolence, during this time, she was seizure-free. Despite her improved seizure frequency, CNB was tapered and discontinued in the fall of 2023.\nLater in the fall of 2023, she required hospitalization for excessive somnolence. At that time, she was only able to stay awake for 2 h per day. However, she remained free of TA and GTC. On admission, her only ASM was LTG 700 mg daily. A brain MRI revealed postsurgical changes from RNS implantation. Routine laboratory studies were unremarkable. Admission LTG level was 10.9 µg/mL (range, 3–12 µg/mL). Despite having discontinued CLB two months earlier (confirmed no prescriptions filled by Michigan Automated Prescription System), she was found to have an N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB) level of 8420 ng/mL (range, 30–3000 ng/mL) and an expectedly undetectable CLB level. Serial CLB and N-CLB levels are outlined in\nClobazam and N-desmethylclobazam levels*.\n*Test performed by Mayo Clinic Laboratories – Rochester Superior Drive, 3050 Superior Drive NW, Rochester, MN 55905.\nShe then completed pharmacogenetic testing, which revealed poor CYP2C19 metabolism with high CYP3A4/5 activity.

In addition, TA seizures recurred. However, she remained free of GTC. Considering her TA recurrence, changes were made to her RNS detection settings. Therapy was also enabled. Details of her RNS detection and therapy settings are outlined in\nResponsive Neurostimulator (RNS) detection settings.\nAbbreviations: Hz – Hertz.\nResponsive Neurostimulator (RNS) therapy settings.\nAbbreviations: LCM – left centromedian nucleus (contacts 1–4, respectively), RCM – right centromedian nucleus (contacts 1–4, respectively), Can – cathode, mA – milliamperes, µs – microseconds, ms – milliseconds, µC/cm\nThree months later, and 8 months after RNS implantation (260 days post-RNS implantation and 91 days after enabling RNS therapy), GTC recurred. Then, as N-CLB levels decreased, GTC increased in frequency such that 15 months post-RNS implantation she was averaging 1 GTC every other month (\nClinical Course. This figure illustrates the clinical course of GTC with respect to treatment with LTG, CLB, and CNB as well as corresponding CLB and N-CLB. The average number of GTC is represented on the Y-axis, and the months are delineated on the X-axis. The dose of LTG remained relatively constant during this time. Treatment with CLB was discontinued in September 2023, and treatment with CNB was discontinued in October 2023. Note the persistently elevated N-CLB corresponded to prolonged freedom from GTC. As the N-CLB began to significantly decrease in March 2024, GTC recurred. Prior to RNS implantation in August 2023, she could have up to 3–7 GTC per month. After RNS implantation and nondetectable N-CLB levels, in November 2024 she averaged 1 GTC every other month.\nA–B: Responsive neurostimulator (RNS) Electrocorticography (ECoG). The recorded GTC was her first GTC after RNS implantation, nearly 9 months after RNS implantation.\nNearly 3 months after enabling RNS therapy, and 15 months after RNS implantation, she had experienced an approximate 90 % reduction in the frequency of GTC. With the resolution of her excessive somnolence and improved GTC frequency, her quality of life was markedly improved. There were discussions to re-challenge lower doses of CLB given the apparent improvement in her seizure frequency from this ASM and RNS therapy settings. However, she and her family were reluctant to restart treatment with CLB. As such, she was maintained on LTG 700 mg daily with optimization of her RNS detection and therapy settings.\nThis case report supports two observations. First, there are profound pharmacokinetic interactions between CLB and CNB that may be exacerbated by genetic polymorphisms. Secondly, there is potential efficacy of RNS in people with drug-resistant IGE and possible synergistic effects of certain ASMs with RNS therapy.\nSpecifically, in this case, a female with drug-resistant IGE experienced excessive somnolence after beginning treatment with CLB. Her somnolence was exacerbated after addition of CNB, and despite discontinuation of both CLB and CNB, N-CLB remained elevated for almost one year. Pharmacogenetic testing revealed poor metabolism via CYP2C19, high activity of CYP3A4, and normal glucuronidation. Her somnolence was correlated with elevated N-CLB levels, and as N-CLB levels fell, her somnolence resolved. Unfortunately, her GTC recurred.. During this time, she also underwent RNS implantation and her most pronounced seizure control occurred during a time of elevated N-CLB levels and enabled RNS therapy.\nClobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine (BZ) with nitrogen located in the 1 and 5 positions of the benzene ring fused to the seven-member ring [\nBoth CLB and N-CLB allosterically bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA\nClobazam has a half-life (t\nCenobamate is a unique ASM that was approved by the US FDA in November 2019 for the treatment of focal epilepsy in patients 18 years old and older [\nPharmacokinetic interactions between CLB, N-CLB, and CNB may be potentiated in individuals with P450 genetic polymorphisms [\nPharmacogenetics is a branch of both pharmacology and genetics that studies inter-individual responses to certain medications [\nSeveral studies have reported CYP2C19 polymorphisms may affect the metabolism of N-CLB [\nThe patient presented in this case report had undetectable CLB levels with N-CLB levels initially measured at three times the upper end of the N-CLB range. Her N-CLB levels then remained supratherapeutic and/or present for nearly 1 year after discontinuing treatment with CLB. Therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude the CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism in combination with an adjunctive trial of CNB led to elevated N-CLB levels and the TRAE. Interestingly, the patient’s overall pharmacogenetic profile may explain the poor efficacy and tolerability of many ASMs apart from LTG. Genes involved in glucuronidation, LTG’s metabolism, were one of the only genes without a mutation and in which normal metabolism was expected.\nIn addition to the profound pharmacokinetic interactions between CLB, N-CLB, and CNB that can be accentuated in individuals with P450 genetic polymorphisms, this case adds to the increasing evidence of the utility of RNS within the CMN of the thalamus in people with drug-resistant IGE [\nIn this case, she continued to experience frequent TA and GTC despite multiple ASM trials. As such, her clinical history was consistent with the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) definition of drug-resistant epilepsy [\nShe underwent RNS implantation within the bilateral CMN of the thalamus in late summer 2023. Before RNS implantation, she could have between 3–7 GTC per month. After RNS implantation, she remained free of GTC off therapy/disabled for 4 months. When RNS therapy was enabled 5 months after implantation (in light of recurrent TA), she remained seizure-free for nearly an additional 4 months. During this time, CLB levels were undetectable but N-CLB levels remained elevated and/or therapeutic (\nThe initial reduction in her seizure frequency, and particularly freedom from GTC, with RNS therapy off/disabled would be within the broad range of the “implantation effect,” which typically lasts 1–5 months [\nCertain ASMs may improve seizure control in patients implanted with RNS [\nSome case series have suggested that N-CLB exhibits greater antiseizure properties than CLB [\nThe patient in this case report had her best seizure control when N-CLB remained elevated, or therapeutic, and RNS therapy was enabled. The improvement in her GTC frequency with elevated and/or therapeutic N-CLB levels may suggest N-CLB, not only CLB, provides a synergistic effect in people receiving RNS therapy. This observation is further supported by GTC recurrence after N-CLB levels were undetectable. At the time of this report, when N-CLB was no longer detectable, she was averaging 1 GTC every other month. Although this was an approximate 83–93 % reduction in her GTC frequency, again, her best seizure control occurred when N-CLB were therapeutic and/or elevated and RNS therapy was enabled.\nThis case report illustrates two clinical considerations. First, there can be pronounced pharmacokinetic interactions with the concomitant use of CLB and CNB. These interactions may be exacerbated in people with P450 genetic polymorphisms, specifically in individuals with mutations to the CYP2C19 isozyme. Secondly, it supports the increasing evidence of the utility of RNS within the bilateral CMN of the thalamus in patients with drug-resistant IGE. Taken together, these observations could suggest N-CLB, and not CLB alone, augments seizure control in patients also treated with RNS.\nThis case report was completed with strict adherence to ethical guidelines, including obtaining informed consent from the patient as well as maintaining confidentiality of protected health information.\nAll authors have read and approved the submitted manuscript.

No studies have explored the combined use of multiple antipsychotics in epilepsy patients, leaving clinicians without standardized protocols for treatment-resistant cases.\nThis report presents a case of POE unresponsive to conventional treatment but demonstrating a successful response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).\nThe patient is a 35-year-old woman with a long-standing history of treatment-resistant left temporal lobe epilepsy, initially diagnosed at the age of 2. Her seizure semiology includes focal impaired consciousness seizures with observable manifestations (characterized by automatisms and clonic movements), focal preserved consciousness seizures without observable manifestations, and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. At the age of 24, the patient underwent surgical intervention involving excision of the antero-lateral temporal cortex, amygdala, and minimal resection of the hippocampus.\nThe patient’s psychiatric history was limited to a few consultations during early adolescence (ages 12–14), primarily for social anxiety and difficulties coping with her epilepsy diagnosis. In her adult years, the patient had no documented psychiatric diagnoses or treatment history. She denied any history of substance abuse. Family history was negative for psychiatric disorders.\nSix months prior to admission, the patient had been experiencing frequent focal seizures—primarily focal preserved consciousness seizures without observable manifestations (with epigastric aura). She also reported one focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure approximately four months prior to presentation on a regimen of levetiracetam (1000 mg twice daily), topiramate (50 mg twice daily), and eslicarbazepine acetate (1600 mg once daily).\nThe patient was brought to the emergency department by authorities after barricading herself in her room for several days, believing she was in imminent danger.\nDuring the initial psychiatric evaluation, she described a gradual onset of persecutory beliefs over the preceding months. She was convinced that her former employer and his associates were stalking her, and reported pervasive feelings of being watched and commented upon—both in public and in her home. She refused to leave her room, believing that people were waiting outside to harm her.\nAdditionally, the patient acknowledged experiencing elevated energy levels, sleeping only four hours per night, and engaging in painting and manual crafts despite lacking formal artistic training. She believed herself to be a true artist, with extraordinary creative abilities. She had spent all her money on purchasing new clothes, claiming she had “reinvented herself and discovered her true talent.” Furthermore, she stated that she was receiving significant sums of money from multiple lawsuits, which she believed were related to individuals copying and reselling her work. She also reported funding the construction of children’s hospitals—possibly reflecting a longstanding desire to become a mother.\nAuditory hallucinations were also present, with voices threatening her and suggesting ongoing plots against her.\nNo other symptoms, including neurological manifestations, were reported.\nNo seizures were witnessed in the days immediately preceding admission. The patient’s last focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure occurred approximately four months earlier. However, the progression of symptoms was insidious, and neither the patient nor her family attributed the onset of psychosis to this prior seizure.\nA routine EEG showed an alpha background rhythm with focal slowing and a single epileptiform discharge in the left temporal region—findings inconsistent with ongoing ictal activity. A brain MRI (under sedation) was unchanged from prior imaging. Additional investigations, including thyroid function, autoimmune and infectious serologies (HIV, HCV, HBV, syphilis, Borrelia), and toxicology screening, were all within normal limits.\nThe patient’s treatment began in the context of severe and persistent psychotic symptoms, which required an assertive pharmacological approach. Olanzapine was initiated at 10 mg/day, followed by the introduction of paliperidone one day later, with gradual titration up to 16 mg/day. As there was no meaningful clinical response, antipsychotic medication was sequentially optimized and adjusted, as detailed in\nAED and Antipsychotic treatment during hospitalization.\nTreatment at the time of beginning ECT treatment is in bold type.\nWith respect to antiepileptic therapy, and following consultation with neurology and review of relevant literature, levetiracetam was replaced with valproic acid due to its known association with psychosis in predisposed individuals. The remainder of the AED regimen—topiramate and eslicarbazepine acetate—remained unchanged.\nIn light of persistent psychotic symptoms despite multiple antipsychotic trials and stable seizure management, the multidisciplinary team proposed electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Treatment was initiated while maintaining the existing AED regimen. The course of ECT, including electrode placement, seizure durations, stimulation parameters, and anesthetic protocol, is summarized in\nElectrode placement and seizure duration during electroconvulsive therapy course.\nBT – Bitemporal; PPF – Propofol; SCC − Succinylcholine.\nAfter the second electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) session, the patient exhibited significant improvements across nearly all areas of prior dysfunction. She showed a notable restoration of emotional expression, along with increased appetite and improved sleep quality, while her delusional beliefs became less pronounced. Following the third ECT session, paliperidone was discontinued. By the ninth treatment session, the patient achieved a complete resolution of delusional symptoms, with only mild, short-term memory difficulties for recent events, which did not impact daily functioning. Her mood improved substantially, enabling her to engage socially, including with family members. No further ECT sessions were administered.\nFollowing the remission of psychotic symptoms, a follow-up EEG was obtained to evaluate for potential neurophysiological changes associated with ECT. This was performed in the context of ongoing multidisciplinary care and out of clinical interest given the marked psychiatric improvement. The EEG showed a slightly slowed sub-alpha background rhythm with occasional generalized slow bursts—suggestive of global dysfunction—and persistent epileptiform activity in the left temporal region. No ictal patterns were observed.\nUpon discharge, the patient's treatment plan included the following medications: Valproic acid (500 mg twice daily), Topiramate (100 mg twice daily), eslicarbazepine acetate (1600 mg once daily), olanzapine (5 mg once daily), haloperidol (8 mg once daily), and diazepam (5 mg once daily).\nThe patient continued to attend follow-up appointments in the psychiatry department of our hospital. At her eight-month follow-up, she remained free of psychotic symptoms and had successfully discontinued all antipsychotic medications. She reported occasional focal seizures—both aware and unaware—with a predominantly catamenial pattern. Notably, no focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures were reported during this period. Functionally, she had made a significant recovery, describing positive relationships with her family and stable employment.\nPsychosis in epilepsy is typically categorized as ictal, postictal, or interictal, based on its temporal relationship to seizure activity. In this case, the absence of ictal activity on EEG, the lack of temporal proximity between the patient’s last tonic-clonic seizure (which occurred four months prior) and the gradual, persistent evolution of psychotic symptoms strongly argue against an ictal or postictal psychosis. Additionally, no seizures were witnessed in the period immediately preceding the onset of psychosis.\nInstead, the clinical presentation is more consistent with interictal psychosis − a syndrome most commonly associated with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. IPE is characterized by the emergence of psychotic symptoms independent of seizure activity and typically arises after years of established epilepsy. In such cases, the delusional content is often complex, incorporating persecutory and grandiose themes, with preservation of affect and premorbid personality—features observed in our patient [\nSeveral established risk factors for IPE were present in this case, including early onset epilepsy, poor seizure control, a left temporal epileptogenic focus, and structural brain lesions [\nGiven the duration of untreated psychosis (at least four months), primary psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were considered in the differential diagnosis.\nHowever, several clinical features favored a diagnosis of IPE over schizophrenia. These included the late onset of symptoms (35 years old) — contrasting with the earlier onset typically seen in schizophrenia — along with multithematic delusions and a preserved affective response, which are characteristic of IPE [\nAs for schizoaffective disorder, DSM-5 criteria require the presence of a major mood episode for the majority of the illness duration and at least two weeks of psychosis in the absence of mood symptoms. In this case, there was no sustained mood episode either preceding or following the psychosis. While the patient exhibited elevated energy, reduced need for sleep, impulsive spending, and grandiose ideas, these features were brief, fragmented, and did not meet criteria for a syndromic manic or depressive episode. Accordingly, they were interpreted as subsyndromal or reactive rather than diagnostic.\nNevertheless, the presence of these mood-like features—though subsyndromal—aligns with existing literature on the frequent co-occurrence of affective symptoms in temporal lobe epilepsy, particularly in cases with left-sided foci [\nOverall, the clinical picture remains most consistent with interictal psychosis, supported by the dissociation from seizure activity, the late onset of symptoms, preserved affect, and the complete remission of psychosis without the need for ongoing antipsychotic therapy. The absence of prior psychiatric history and the rapid, sustained resolution of symptoms following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) further argue against a primary psychotic disorder.\nMoreover, the absence of prior psychiatric history and the complete remission of symptoms following ECT—without the need for maintenance antipsychotic treatment—further argue against a primary psychotic disorder.\nIatrogenic causes were also considered and ruled out: there were no recent changes in the patient's antiepileptic regimen prior to symptom onset, and an extensive diagnostic work-up excluded structural abnormalities, autoimmune encephalitis, central nervous system infections, metabolic disturbances, and substance-induced or toxic etiologies.\nThis case illustrates the diagnostic complexity of psychiatric symptoms in epilepsy and underscores the importance of a broad differential, including both interictal psychosis and mood-psychosis overlap, particularly in patients with temporal lobe pathology.\nManagement followed a multidisciplinary strategy involving close collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists. Given the patient's chronic, treatment-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, adjustments to her AED regimen were carefully considered. Levetiracetam was replaced with valproic acid due to concerns about its potential psychiatric side effects, particularly mood and behavioral disturbances, which have been reported in vulnerable individuals [\nNo further AED changes were made to minimize destabilization of seizure control.\nAntipsychotic treatment was pursued cautiously, avoiding agents with higher pro-convulsant potential such as clozapine and chlorpromazine [\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well-established treatment for severe mood disorders and catatonia, and is also frequently employed in cases of refractory psychosis [\nIn the present case, ECT was considered following multiple unsuccessful antipsychotic trials and despite optimization of the patient’s antiepileptic regimen. The decision to proceed with ECT was supported by prior case reports [\nECT resulted in full remission of psychotic symptoms, which was sustained over an eight-month follow-up period, without major adverse effects. These outcomes support the potential role of ECT in treatment-refractory interictal psychosis.\nInterestingly, a concurrent reduction in seizure frequency was also observed. While seizure control was not a primary target of the intervention, this improvement prompted retrospective consideration of a possible modulatory effect of ECT on subclinical epileptiform activity. Prior literature has suggested that persistent subclinical discharges may contribute to pharmacoresistant psychosis and that ECT might help suppress such activity [\nA post-ECT EEG in our patient did not show a definitive reduction in left temporal epileptiform activity; however, its limited duration may have precluded the detection of intermittent or transient discharges. Although modulation of epileptiform activity was not an explicit goal of treatment, the simultaneous psychiatric and neurological improvements observed raise the possibility of an additional mechanism of action. Further investigation, including prolonged EEG monitoring before and after ECT, would be required to explore this hypothesis more robustly.\nTo our knowledge, this is one of the few reported cases of interictal psychosis in epilepsy successfully treated with ECT. Future research is needed to develop standardized protocols, establish safety parameters, and clarify the role of ECT in managing psychosis associated with epilepsy.\nThis case highlights the importance of individualized, multidisciplinary management of psychosis of epilepsy (POE), especially in treatment-refractory presentations. It supports the cautious use of ECT as a safe and potentially effective alternative when standard pharmacologic strategies fail.\nFurther studies—particularly randomized controlled trials—are warranted to better characterize the role of ECT in epilepsy-associated psychosis and to inform future treatment guidelines for this complex and under-researched condition.\nThis case report was conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines for medical research and patient confidentiality.

The major finding that stuck out to me was that whereas the average wholesale cost per prescription for intranasal prescriptions was on the order of $700, the average wholesale cost for buccal midazolam prescriptions was…$2 (!). Now, intranasal administration does have advantages by virtue of not having to administer anything into the oral (or rectal) cavity. But still, the enormous cost difference is something worth keeping in mind, as healthcare costs spiral upwards, given brand-name medications are known to be up to an order of magnitude more expensive than generic medications.\nWhile conversations regarding which patients should receive rescue benzodiazepine and which type must be individualized, and it is encouraging that rescue benzodiazepines have increased since the introduction of intranasal formulations, these data likely highlight an important area for improvement.", "topic": "Epilepsy"}

It remains unclear when pathogenic variants causing FCD type 2 occur during development, and how they affect mutant compared to nonmutant cells. In this study, single-cell transcriptomics combined with cell-type-resolved genotyping of somatic variants reveal that FCD type 2 affects mainly neurectoderm-derived cortical cells. Mutant neurons in the mosaic cortical lesions show upregulation of pathways related to metabolism and cell growth, which are downregulated in nonmutant neurons. We further identified changes in microglial activation, synaptic homeostasis, and neuronal connectivity potentially contributing to epileptogenesis.\nWhile it is widely accepted that somatic variants that activate the PI3K-mTOR pathway are a major cause of drug-resistant focal epilepsy, typically associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type 2, understanding the mechanism of epileptogenesis requires identifying genotype-associated changes at the single-cell level, which is technically challenging with existing methods. Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of 18 FCD type 2 samples removed surgically for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, and 17 non-FCD control samples, and analyzed additional published data comprising >400,000 single nuclei. We also performed simultaneous single-nucleus genotyping and gene expression analysis using two independent approaches: 1) a method that we called genotyping of transcriptomes enhanced with nanopore sequencing (GO-TEN) that combines targeted cDNA long-read sequencing with snRNA-seq, 2) ResolveOME snRNA-seq and DNA genotyping. snRNA-seq showed similar cell identities and proportions between cases and controls, suggesting that mosaic pathogenic variants in PI3K-mTOR pathway genes in FCD exert their effect by disrupting transcription in conserved cell types. GO-TEN and ResolveOME analyses confirmed that pathogenic variant-carrying cells have well-differentiated neuronal or glial identities, with enrichment of variants in cells of the neuroectodermal lineage, pointing to cortical neural progenitors as possible loci of somatic mutation. Within FCD type 2 lesions, we identified upregulation of PI3K-mTOR signaling and related pathways in variant-carrying neurons, downregulation of these pathways in non-variant-carrying neurons, as well as associated changes in microglial activation, cellular metabolism, synaptic homeostasis, and neuronal connectivity, all potentially contributing to epileptogenesis.

A second limitation is the technically demanding nature of the GO-TEN technology that results in incomplete genotyping of all the available alleles. Finally, our regression analysis reveals that certain cell types are preferentially genotyped for a given gene, perhaps due to differential isoform usage although future studies are needed to investigate this hypothesis. Although ResolveOME addresses some of these limitations by performing genotyping on the amplified DNA and by genotyping both alleles, it is significantly more expensive and has lower throughput.\nDespite these limitations, our study highlights the importance of investigating both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of somatic variants in mosaic FCD2, showing that both aspects are likely involved in disease pathophysiology.

Nonetheless, in some instances—particularly where POE manifests with postictal or interictal features—symptoms may persist over time and require targeted interventions [\nThe diagnosis and management of POE remain challenging, owing to the limited available research on effective treatment strategies. Even the most recent consensus (2011) provides limited guidance on whether epilepsy patients exhibit similar response and remission rates as those with schizophrenia or how to manage cases unresponsive to antipsychotics [\nCurrent literature primarily focuses on the acute management of POE, emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists and psychiatrists [\nAntipsychotic treatment is commonly used in POE to manage severe symptoms, agitation, or cases unresponsive to optimized AED therapy or benzodiazepines [\nA significant gap in the literature remains regarding the management of refractory POE, including cases unresponsive to antipsychotic treatment. No studies have explored the combined use of multiple antipsychotics in epilepsy patients, leaving clinicians without standardized protocols for treatment-resistant cases.\nThis report presents a case of POE unresponsive to conventional treatment but demonstrating a successful response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).\nThe patient is a 35-year-old woman with a long-standing history of treatment-resistant left temporal lobe epilepsy, initially diagnosed at the age of 2. Her seizure semiology includes focal impaired consciousness seizures with observable manifestations (characterized by automatisms and clonic movements), focal preserved consciousness seizures without observable manifestations, and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. At the age of 24, the patient underwent surgical intervention involving excision of the antero-lateral temporal cortex, amygdala, and minimal resection of the hippocampus.\nThe patient’s psychiatric history was limited to a few consultations during early adolescence (ages 12–14), primarily for social anxiety and difficulties coping with her epilepsy diagnosis. In her adult years, the patient had no documented psychiatric diagnoses or treatment history. She denied any history of substance abuse. Family history was negative for psychiatric disorders.\nSix months prior to admission, the patient had been experiencing frequent focal seizures—primarily focal preserved consciousness seizures without observable manifestations (with epigastric aura). She also reported one focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure approximately four months prior to presentation on a regimen of levetiracetam (1000 mg twice daily), topiramate (50 mg twice daily), and eslicarbazepine acetate (1600 mg once daily).\nThe patient was brought to the emergency department by authorities after barricading herself in her room for several days, believing she was in imminent danger.\nDuring the initial psychiatric evaluation, she described a gradual onset of persecutory beliefs over the preceding months. She was convinced that her former employer and his associates were stalking her, and reported pervasive feelings of being watched and commented upon—both in public and in her home. She refused to leave her room, believing that people were waiting outside to harm her.\nAdditionally, the patient acknowledged experiencing elevated energy levels, sleeping only four hours per night, and engaging in painting and manual crafts despite lacking formal artistic training. She believed herself to be a true artist, with extraordinary creative abilities. She had spent all her money on purchasing new clothes, claiming she had “reinvented herself and discovered her true talent.” Furthermore, she stated that she was receiving significant sums of money from multiple lawsuits, which she believed were related to individuals copying and reselling her work. She also reported funding the construction of children’s hospitals—possibly reflecting a longstanding desire to become a mother.\nAuditory hallucinations were also present, with voices threatening her and suggesting ongoing plots against her.\nNo other symptoms, including neurological manifestations, were reported.\nNo seizures were witnessed in the days immediately preceding admission. The patient’s last focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure occurred approximately four months earlier. However, the progression of symptoms was insidious, and neither the patient nor her family attributed the onset of psychosis to this prior seizure.\nA routine EEG showed an alpha background rhythm with focal slowing and a single epileptiform discharge in the left temporal region—findings inconsistent with ongoing ictal activity. A brain MRI (under sedation) was unchanged from prior imaging. Additional investigations, including thyroid function, autoimmune and infectious serologies (HIV, HCV, HBV, syphilis, Borrelia), and toxicology screening, were all within normal limits.\nThe patient’s treatment began in the context of severe and persistent psychotic symptoms, which required an assertive pharmacological approach. Olanzapine was initiated at 10 mg/day, followed by the introduction of paliperidone one day later, with gradual titration up to 16 mg/day. As there was no meaningful clinical response, antipsychotic medication was sequentially optimized and adjusted, as detailed in\nAED and Antipsychotic treatment during hospitalization.\nTreatment at the time of beginning ECT treatment is in bold type.\nWith respect to antiepileptic therapy, and following consultation with neurology and review of relevant literature, levetiracetam was replaced with valproic acid due to its known association with psychosis in predisposed individuals. The remainder of the AED regimen—topiramate and eslicarbazepine acetate—remained unchanged.\nIn light of persistent psychotic symptoms despite multiple antipsychotic trials and stable seizure management, the multidisciplinary team proposed electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Treatment was initiated while maintaining the existing AED regimen. The course of ECT, including electrode placement, seizure durations, stimulation parameters, and anesthetic protocol, is summarized in\nElectrode placement and seizure duration during electroconvulsive therapy course.\nBT – Bitemporal; PPF – Propofol; SCC − Succinylcholine.\nAfter the second electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) session, the patient exhibited significant improvements across nearly all areas of prior dysfunction. She showed a notable restoration of emotional expression, along with increased appetite and improved sleep quality, while her delusional beliefs became less pronounced. Following the third ECT session, paliperidone was discontinued. By the ninth treatment session, the patient achieved a complete resolution of delusional symptoms, with only mild, short-term memory difficulties for recent events, which did not impact daily functioning. Her mood improved substantially, enabling her to engage socially, including with family members. No further ECT sessions were administered.\nFollowing the remission of psychotic symptoms, a follow-up EEG was obtained to evaluate for potential neurophysiological changes associated with ECT. This was performed in the context of ongoing multidisciplinary care and out of clinical interest given the marked psychiatric improvement. The EEG showed a slightly slowed sub-alpha background rhythm with occasional generalized slow bursts—suggestive of global dysfunction—and persistent epileptiform activity in the left temporal region. No ictal patterns were observed.\nUpon discharge, the patient's treatment plan included the following medications: Valproic acid (500 mg twice daily), Topiramate (100 mg twice daily), eslicarbazepine acetate (1600 mg once daily), olanzapine (5 mg once daily), haloperidol (8 mg once daily), and diazepam (5 mg once daily).\nThe patient continued to attend follow-up appointments in the psychiatry department of our hospital. At her eight-month follow-up, she remained free of psychotic symptoms and had successfully discontinued all antipsychotic medications. She reported occasional focal seizures—both aware and unaware—with a predominantly catamenial pattern. Notably, no focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures were reported during this period. Functionally, she had made a significant recovery, describing positive relationships with her family and stable employment.\nPsychosis in epilepsy is typically categorized as ictal, postictal, or interictal, based on its temporal relationship to seizure activity. In this case, the absence of ictal activity on EEG, the lack of temporal proximity between the patient’s last tonic-clonic seizure (which occurred four months prior) and the gradual, persistent evolution of psychotic symptoms strongly argue against an ictal or postictal psychosis. Additionally, no seizures were witnessed in the period immediately preceding the onset of psychosis.\nInstead, the clinical presentation is more consistent with interictal psychosis − a syndrome most commonly associated with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. IPE is characterized by the emergence of psychotic symptoms independent of seizure activity and typically arises after years of established epilepsy. In such cases, the delusional content is often complex, incorporating persecutory and grandiose themes, with preservation of affect and premorbid personality—features observed in our patient [\nSeveral established risk factors for IPE were present in this case, including early onset epilepsy, poor seizure control, a left temporal epileptogenic focus, and structural brain lesions [\nGiven the duration of untreated psychosis (at least four months), primary psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were considered in the differential diagnosis.\nHowever, several clinical features favored a diagnosis of IPE over schizophrenia. These included the late onset of symptoms (35 years old) — contrasting with the earlier onset typically seen in schizophrenia — along with multithematic delusions and a preserved affective response, which are characteristic of IPE [\nAs for schizoaffective disorder, DSM-5 criteria require the presence of a major mood episode for the majority of the illness duration and at least two weeks of psychosis in the absence of mood symptoms. In this case, there was no sustained mood episode either preceding or following the psychosis. While the patient exhibited elevated energy, reduced need for sleep, impulsive spending, and grandiose ideas, these features were brief, fragmented, and did not meet criteria for a syndromic manic or depressive episode. Accordingly, they were interpreted as subsyndromal or reactive rather than diagnostic.\nNevertheless, the presence of these mood-like features—though subsyndromal—aligns with existing literature on the frequent co-occurrence of affective symptoms in temporal lobe epilepsy, particularly in cases with left-sided foci [\nOverall, the clinical picture remains most consistent with interictal psychosis, supported by the dissociation from seizure activity, the late onset of symptoms, preserved affect, and the complete remission of psychosis without the need for ongoing antipsychotic therapy. The absence of prior psychiatric history and the rapid, sustained resolution of symptoms following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) further argue against a primary psychotic disorder.\nMoreover, the absence of prior psychiatric history and the complete remission of symptoms following ECT—without the need for maintenance antipsychotic treatment—further argue against a primary psychotic disorder.\nIatrogenic causes were also considered and ruled out: there were no recent changes in the patient's antiepileptic regimen prior to symptom onset, and an extensive diagnostic work-up excluded structural abnormalities, autoimmune encephalitis, central nervous system infections, metabolic disturbances, and substance-induced or toxic etiologies.\nThis case illustrates the diagnostic complexity of psychiatric symptoms in epilepsy and underscores the importance of a broad differential, including both interictal psychosis and mood-psychosis overlap, particularly in patients with temporal lobe pathology.\nManagement followed a multidisciplinary strategy involving close collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists. Given the patient's chronic, treatment-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, adjustments to her AED regimen were carefully considered. Levetiracetam was replaced with valproic acid due to concerns about its potential psychiatric side effects, particularly mood and behavioral disturbances, which have been reported in vulnerable individuals [\nNo further AED changes were made to minimize destabilization of seizure control.\nAntipsychotic treatment was pursued cautiously, avoiding agents with higher pro-convulsant potential such as clozapine and chlorpromazine [\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well-established treatment for severe mood disorders and catatonia, and is also frequently employed in cases of refractory psychosis [\nIn the present case, ECT was considered following multiple unsuccessful antipsychotic trials and despite optimization of the patient’s antiepileptic regimen. The decision to proceed with ECT was supported by prior case reports [\nECT resulted in full remission of psychotic symptoms, which was sustained over an eight-month follow-up period, without major adverse effects. These outcomes support the potential role of ECT in treatment-refractory interictal psychosis.\nInterestingly, a concurrent reduction in seizure frequency was also observed. While seizure control was not a primary target of the intervention, this improvement prompted retrospective consideration of a possible modulatory effect of ECT on subclinical epileptiform activity. Prior literature has suggested that persistent subclinical discharges may contribute to pharmacoresistant psychosis and that ECT might help suppress such activity [\nA post-ECT EEG in our patient did not show a definitive reduction in left temporal epileptiform activity; however, its limited duration may have precluded the detection of intermittent or transient discharges. Although modulation of epileptiform activity was not an explicit goal of treatment, the simultaneous psychiatric and neurological improvements observed raise the possibility of an additional mechanism of action. Further investigation, including prolonged EEG monitoring before and after ECT, would be required to explore this hypothesis more robustly.\nTo our knowledge, this is one of the few reported cases of interictal psychosis in epilepsy successfully treated with ECT. Future research is needed to develop standardized protocols, establish safety parameters, and clarify the role of ECT in managing psychosis associated with epilepsy.\nThis case highlights the importance of individualized, multidisciplinary management of psychosis of epilepsy (POE), especially in treatment-refractory presentations. It supports the cautious use of ECT as a safe and potentially effective alternative when standard pharmacologic strategies fail.\nFurther studies—particularly randomized controlled trials—are warranted to better characterize the role of ECT in epilepsy-associated psychosis and to inform future treatment guidelines for this complex and under-researched condition.\nThis case report was conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines for medical research and patient confidentiality.

Nonetheless, in some instances—particularly where POE manifests with postictal or interictal features—symptoms may persist over time and require targeted interventions [\nThe diagnosis and management of POE remain challenging, owing to the limited available research on effective treatment strategies. Even the most recent consensus (2011) provides limited guidance on whether epilepsy patients exhibit similar response and remission rates as those with schizophrenia or how to manage cases unresponsive to antipsychotics [\nCurrent literature primarily focuses on the acute management of POE, emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists and psychiatrists [\nAntipsychotic treatment is commonly used in POE to manage severe symptoms, agitation, or cases unresponsive to optimized AED therapy or benzodiazepines [\nA significant gap in the literature remains regarding the management of refractory POE, including cases unresponsive to antipsychotic treatment. No studies have explored the combined use of multiple antipsychotics in epilepsy patients, leaving clinicians without standardized protocols for treatment-resistant cases.\nThis report presents a case of POE unresponsive to conventional treatment but demonstrating a successful response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).\nThe patient is a 35-year-old woman with a long-standing history of treatment-resistant left temporal lobe epilepsy, initially diagnosed at the age of 2. Her seizure semiology includes focal impaired consciousness seizures with observable manifestations (characterized by automatisms and clonic movements), focal preserved consciousness seizures without observable manifestations, and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. At the age of 24, the patient underwent surgical intervention involving excision of the antero-lateral temporal cortex, amygdala, and minimal resection of the hippocampus.\nThe patient’s psychiatric history was limited to a few consultations during early adolescence (ages 12–14), primarily for social anxiety and difficulties coping with her epilepsy diagnosis. In her adult years, the patient had no documented psychiatric diagnoses or treatment history. She denied any history of substance abuse. Family history was negative for psychiatric disorders.\nSix months prior to admission, the patient had been experiencing frequent focal seizures—primarily focal preserved consciousness seizures without observable manifestations (with epigastric aura). She also reported one focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure approximately four months prior to presentation on a regimen of levetiracetam (1000 mg twice daily), topiramate (50 mg twice daily), and eslicarbazepine acetate (1600 mg once daily).\nThe patient was brought to the emergency department by authorities after barricading herself in her room for several days, believing she was in imminent danger.\nDuring the initial psychiatric evaluation, she described a gradual onset of persecutory beliefs over the preceding months. She was convinced that her former employer and his associates were stalking her, and reported pervasive feelings of being watched and commented upon—both in public and in her home. She refused to leave her room, believing that people were waiting outside to harm her.\nAdditionally, the patient acknowledged experiencing elevated energy levels, sleeping only four hours per night, and engaging in painting and manual crafts despite lacking formal artistic training. She believed herself to be a true artist, with extraordinary creative abilities. She had spent all her money on purchasing new clothes, claiming she had “reinvented herself and discovered her true talent.” Furthermore, she stated that she was receiving significant sums of money from multiple lawsuits, which she believed were related to individuals copying and reselling her work. She also reported funding the construction of children’s hospitals—possibly reflecting a longstanding desire to become a mother.\nAuditory hallucinations were also present, with voices threatening her and suggesting ongoing plots against her.\nNo other symptoms, including neurological manifestations, were reported.\nNo seizures were witnessed in the days immediately preceding admission. The patient’s last focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure occurred approximately four months earlier. However, the progression of symptoms was insidious, and neither the patient nor her family attributed the onset of psychosis to this prior seizure.\nA routine EEG showed an alpha background rhythm with focal slowing and a single epileptiform discharge in the left temporal region—findings inconsistent with ongoing ictal activity. A brain MRI (under sedation) was unchanged from prior imaging. Additional investigations, including thyroid function, autoimmune and infectious serologies (HIV, HCV, HBV, syphilis, Borrelia), and toxicology screening, were all within normal limits.\nThe patient’s treatment began in the context of severe and persistent psychotic symptoms, which required an assertive pharmacological approach. Olanzapine was initiated at 10 mg/day, followed by the introduction of paliperidone one day later, with gradual titration up to 16 mg/day. As there was no meaningful clinical response, antipsychotic medication was sequentially optimized and adjusted, as detailed in\nAED and Antipsychotic treatment during hospitalization.\nTreatment at the time of beginning ECT treatment is in bold type.\nWith respect to antiepileptic therapy, and following consultation with neurology and review of relevant literature, levetiracetam was replaced with valproic acid due to its known association with psychosis in predisposed individuals. The remainder of the AED regimen—topiramate and eslicarbazepine acetate—remained unchanged.\nIn light of persistent psychotic symptoms despite multiple antipsychotic trials and stable seizure management, the multidisciplinary team proposed electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Treatment was initiated while maintaining the existing AED regimen. The course of ECT, including electrode placement, seizure durations, stimulation parameters, and anesthetic protocol, is summarized in\nElectrode placement and seizure duration during electroconvulsive therapy course.\nBT – Bitemporal; PPF – Propofol; SCC − Succinylcholine.\nAfter the second electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) session, the patient exhibited significant improvements across nearly all areas of prior dysfunction. She showed a notable restoration of emotional expression, along with increased appetite and improved sleep quality, while her delusional beliefs became less pronounced. Following the third ECT session, paliperidone was discontinued. By the ninth treatment session, the patient achieved a complete resolution of delusional symptoms, with only mild, short-term memory difficulties for recent events, which did not impact daily functioning. Her mood improved substantially, enabling her to engage socially, including with family members. No further ECT sessions were administered.\nFollowing the remission of psychotic symptoms, a follow-up EEG was obtained to evaluate for potential neurophysiological changes associated with ECT. This was performed in the context of ongoing multidisciplinary care and out of clinical interest given the marked psychiatric improvement. The EEG showed a slightly slowed sub-alpha background rhythm with occasional generalized slow bursts—suggestive of global dysfunction—and persistent epileptiform activity in the left temporal region. No ictal patterns were observed.\nUpon discharge, the patient's treatment plan included the following medications: Valproic acid (500 mg twice daily), Topiramate (100 mg twice daily), eslicarbazepine acetate (1600 mg once daily), olanzapine (5 mg once daily), haloperidol (8 mg once daily), and diazepam (5 mg once daily).\nThe patient continued to attend follow-up appointments in the psychiatry department of our hospital. At her eight-month follow-up, she remained free of psychotic symptoms and had successfully discontinued all antipsychotic medications. She reported occasional focal seizures—both aware and unaware—with a predominantly catamenial pattern. Notably, no focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures were reported during this period. Functionally, she had made a significant recovery, describing positive relationships with her family and stable employment.\nPsychosis in epilepsy is typically categorized as ictal, postictal, or interictal, based on its temporal relationship to seizure activity. In this case, the absence of ictal activity on EEG, the lack of temporal proximity between the patient’s last tonic-clonic seizure (which occurred four months prior) and the gradual, persistent evolution of psychotic symptoms strongly argue against an ictal or postictal psychosis. Additionally, no seizures were witnessed in the period immediately preceding the onset of psychosis.\nInstead, the clinical presentation is more consistent with interictal psychosis − a syndrome most commonly associated with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. IPE is characterized by the emergence of psychotic symptoms independent of seizure activity and typically arises after years of established epilepsy. In such cases, the delusional content is often complex, incorporating persecutory and grandiose themes, with preservation of affect and premorbid personality—features observed in our patient [\nSeveral established risk factors for IPE were present in this case, including early onset epilepsy, poor seizure control, a left temporal epileptogenic focus, and structural brain lesions [\nGiven the duration of untreated psychosis (at least four months), primary psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were considered in the differential diagnosis.\nHowever, several clinical features favored a diagnosis of IPE over schizophrenia. These included the late onset of symptoms (35 years old) — contrasting with the earlier onset typically seen in schizophrenia — along with multithematic delusions and a preserved affective response, which are characteristic of IPE [\nAs for schizoaffective disorder, DSM-5 criteria require the presence of a major mood episode for the majority of the illness duration and at least two weeks of psychosis in the absence of mood symptoms. In this case, there was no sustained mood episode either preceding or following the psychosis. While the patient exhibited elevated energy, reduced need for sleep, impulsive spending, and grandiose ideas, these features were brief, fragmented, and did not meet criteria for a syndromic manic or depressive episode.

Her seizures began around the age of 12 years old with recurrent TA. Initial treatments with ethosuximide, and then levetiracetam, were not efficacious. Then at the age of 19 years old, she developed GTC. During this time, EEG revealed generalized, frontally predominant, 3 Hz, spike-and-wave discharges. A brain MRI was unremarkable for discrete epileptic lesions. Considering her history, semiology, and diagnostic studies, she was diagnosed with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and the electroclinical syndrome, juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) (\nA–D: Scalp EEG. This figure provides representative scalp EEG epileptiform abnormalities from inpatient video-EEG monitoring. A–C are 15 s epochs of EEG, while\nDespite several antiseizure medication (ASM) trials, including valproate, zonisamide, lamotrigine, brivaracetam, perampanel, lacosamide, and pharmacologic grade cannabidiol, she continued to experience frequent seizures. Additionally, she experienced several treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) from these medications.\nShe was followed in the Corewell Health William Beaumont University Hospital Adult Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and presented to the Emergency Department in early summer 2023 after a breakthrough GTC. Before this seizure and her hospital admission to the hospital, her case had been presented and reviewed at the patient management conference. There was a consensus to proceed with responsive neurostimulator (RNS) implantation with depth electrodes targeting bilateral centromedian nuclei (CMN) of the thalamus.\nAt the time of her admission, her ASM regimen consisted of lamotrigine (LTG) monotherapy with a dose of 700 mg daily. Her baseline seizure frequency was reported as multiple TA per day and 3–7 (average of 5) GTC per month. During the admission, given her ongoing seizures, treatment with clobazam (CLB) was initiated (10 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks, then 20 mg at bedtime). No changes were made to her LTG dose.\nIncreasing daytime somnolence was noted at a follow-up visit one month later. Due to ongoing seizures, CLB was titrated in stepwise fashion every 2 weeks to 40 mg nightly. Approximately one month later, and 2 months after beginning treatment with CLB, responsive neurostimulator (RNS) targeting bilateral CMN was implanted.\nAt the time of RNS implantation, excessive somnolence was reported by her family such that she was sleeping nearly 20 h per day. It was clinically suspected that her somnolence was CLB-related. As such, a transition was initiated from CLB to cenobamate (CNB).\nClobazam dose.\nUnfortunately, somnolence persisted during the CNB titration and after achieving a CNB dose of 200 mg nightly. Although she continued to experience excessive somnolence, during this time, she was seizure-free. Despite her improved seizure frequency, CNB was tapered and discontinued in the fall of 2023.\nLater in the fall of 2023, she required hospitalization for excessive somnolence. At that time, she was only able to stay awake for 2 h per day. However, she remained free of TA and GTC. On admission, her only ASM was LTG 700 mg daily. A brain MRI revealed postsurgical changes from RNS implantation. Routine laboratory studies were unremarkable. Admission LTG level was 10.9 µg/mL (range, 3–12 µg/mL). Despite having discontinued CLB two months earlier (confirmed no prescriptions filled by Michigan Automated Prescription System), she was found to have an N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB) level of 8420 ng/mL (range, 30–3000 ng/mL) and an expectedly undetectable CLB level. Serial CLB and N-CLB levels are outlined in\nClobazam and N-desmethylclobazam levels*.\n*Test performed by Mayo Clinic Laboratories – Rochester Superior Drive, 3050 Superior Drive NW, Rochester, MN 55905.\nShe then completed pharmacogenetic testing, which revealed poor CYP2C19 metabolism with high CYP3A4/5 activity. Glucuronidation demonstrated normal metabolism. The full results of the pharmacogenetic testing are detailed in\nPharmacogenomic testing\nAbbreviations: NF – normal function, DF – decreased function, PM – poor metabolizer, NM – normal metabolizer, HA – high activity.\nTest performed by Genomind, 2200 Renaissance Blvd #100 King of Prussia, PA 19406.\nApproximately 5 months after RNS implantation, in early winter 2024, her somnolence had improved but she continued to report excessive sleepiness. In addition, TA seizures recurred. However, she remained free of GTC. Considering her TA recurrence, changes were made to her RNS detection settings. Therapy was also enabled. Details of her RNS detection and therapy settings are outlined in\nResponsive Neurostimulator (RNS) detection settings.\nAbbreviations: Hz – Hertz.\nResponsive Neurostimulator (RNS) therapy settings.\nAbbreviations: LCM – left centromedian nucleus (contacts 1–4, respectively), RCM – right centromedian nucleus (contacts 1–4, respectively), Can – cathode, mA – milliamperes, µs – microseconds, ms – milliseconds, µC/cm\nThree months later, and 8 months after RNS implantation (260 days post-RNS implantation and 91 days after enabling RNS therapy), GTC recurred. Then, as N-CLB levels decreased, GTC increased in frequency such that 15 months post-RNS implantation she was averaging 1 GTC every other month (\nClinical Course. This figure illustrates the clinical course of GTC with respect to treatment with LTG, CLB, and CNB as well as corresponding CLB and N-CLB. The average number of GTC is represented on the Y-axis, and the months are delineated on the X-axis. The dose of LTG remained relatively constant during this time. Treatment with CLB was discontinued in September 2023, and treatment with CNB was discontinued in October 2023. Note the persistently elevated N-CLB corresponded to prolonged freedom from GTC. As the N-CLB began to significantly decrease in March 2024, GTC recurred. Prior to RNS implantation in August 2023, she could have up to 3–7 GTC per month. After RNS implantation and nondetectable N-CLB levels, in November 2024 she averaged 1 GTC every other month.\nA–B: Responsive neurostimulator (RNS) Electrocorticography (ECoG). The recorded GTC was her first GTC after RNS implantation, nearly 9 months after RNS implantation.\nNearly 3 months after enabling RNS therapy, and 15 months after RNS implantation, she had experienced an approximate 90 % reduction in the frequency of GTC. With the resolution of her excessive somnolence and improved GTC frequency, her quality of life was markedly improved. There were discussions to re-challenge lower doses of CLB given the apparent improvement in her seizure frequency from this ASM and RNS therapy settings. However, she and her family were reluctant to restart treatment with CLB. As such, she was maintained on LTG 700 mg daily with optimization of her RNS detection and therapy settings.\nThis case report supports two observations. First, there are profound pharmacokinetic interactions between CLB and CNB that may be exacerbated by genetic polymorphisms. Secondly, there is potential efficacy of RNS in people with drug-resistant IGE and possible synergistic effects of certain ASMs with RNS therapy.\nSpecifically, in this case, a female with drug-resistant IGE experienced excessive somnolence after beginning treatment with CLB. Her somnolence was exacerbated after addition of CNB, and despite discontinuation of both CLB and CNB, N-CLB remained elevated for almost one year. Pharmacogenetic testing revealed poor metabolism via CYP2C19, high activity of CYP3A4, and normal glucuronidation. Her somnolence was correlated with elevated N-CLB levels, and as N-CLB levels fell, her somnolence resolved. Unfortunately, her GTC recurred.. During this time, she also underwent RNS implantation and her most pronounced seizure control occurred during a time of elevated N-CLB levels and enabled RNS therapy.\nClobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine (BZ) with nitrogen located in the 1 and 5 positions of the benzene ring fused to the seven-member ring [\nBoth CLB and N-CLB allosterically bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA\nClobazam has a half-life (t\nCenobamate is a unique ASM that was approved by the US FDA in November 2019 for the treatment of focal epilepsy in patients 18 years old and older [\nPharmacokinetic interactions between CLB, N-CLB, and CNB may be potentiated in individuals with P450 genetic polymorphisms [\nPharmacogenetics is a branch of both pharmacology and genetics that studies inter-individual responses to certain medications [\nSeveral studies have reported CYP2C19 polymorphisms may affect the metabolism of N-CLB [\nThe patient presented in this case report had undetectable CLB levels with N-CLB levels initially measured at three times the upper end of the N-CLB range. Her N-CLB levels then remained supratherapeutic and/or present for nearly 1 year after discontinuing treatment with CLB. Therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude the CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism in combination with an adjunctive trial of CNB led to elevated N-CLB levels and the TRAE. Interestingly, the patient’s overall pharmacogenetic profile may explain the poor efficacy and tolerability of many ASMs apart from LTG. Genes involved in glucuronidation, LTG’s metabolism, were one of the only genes without a mutation and in which normal metabolism was expected.\nIn addition to the profound pharmacokinetic interactions between CLB, N-CLB, and CNB that can be accentuated in individuals with P450 genetic polymorphisms, this case adds to the increasing evidence of the utility of RNS within the CMN of the thalamus in people with drug-resistant IGE [\nIn this case, she continued to experience frequent TA and GTC despite multiple ASM trials. As such, her clinical history was consistent with the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) definition of drug-resistant epilepsy [\nShe underwent RNS implantation within the bilateral CMN of the thalamus in late summer 2023. Before RNS implantation, she could have between 3–7 GTC per month. After RNS implantation, she remained free of GTC off therapy/disabled for 4 months. When RNS therapy was enabled 5 months after implantation (in light of recurrent TA), she remained seizure-free for nearly an additional 4 months. During this time, CLB levels were undetectable but N-CLB levels remained elevated and/or therapeutic (\nThe initial reduction in her seizure frequency, and particularly freedom from GTC, with RNS therapy off/disabled would be within the broad range of the “implantation effect,” which typically lasts 1–5 months [\nCertain ASMs may improve seizure control in patients implanted with RNS [\nSome case series have suggested that N-CLB exhibits greater antiseizure properties than CLB [\nThe patient in this case report had her best seizure control when N-CLB remained elevated, or therapeutic, and RNS therapy was enabled. The improvement in her GTC frequency with elevated and/or therapeutic N-CLB levels may suggest N-CLB, not only CLB, provides a synergistic effect in people receiving RNS therapy. This observation is further supported by GTC recurrence after N-CLB levels were undetectable. At the time of this report, when N-CLB was no longer detectable, she was averaging 1 GTC every other month. Although this was an approximate 83–93 % reduction in her GTC frequency, again, her best seizure control occurred when N-CLB were therapeutic and/or elevated and RNS therapy was enabled.\nThis case report illustrates two clinical considerations. First, there can be pronounced pharmacokinetic interactions with the concomitant use of CLB and CNB. These interactions may be exacerbated in people with P450 genetic polymorphisms, specifically in individuals with mutations to the CYP2C19 isozyme. Secondly, it supports the increasing evidence of the utility of RNS within the bilateral CMN of the thalamus in patients with drug-resistant IGE. Taken together, these observations could suggest N-CLB, and not CLB alone, augments seizure control in patients also treated with RNS.\nThis case report was completed with strict adherence to ethical guidelines, including obtaining informed consent from the patient as well as maintaining confidentiality of protected health information.\nAll authors have read and approved the submitted manuscript.

However, concomitant use of these two ASMs may lead to significant treatment-related adverse events (TRAE). Furthermore, these TRAE may be exacerbated in individuals with genetic polymorphisms involving the P450 system. In patients with DRE, epilepsy surgery, including neuromodulation, may lead to improved seizure control and a reduction in systemic TRAE from ASMs.\nThis case report describes a patient with drug-resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) who, after a relatively short course of CLB therapy experienced persistently excessive somnolence correlated with persistently elevated N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB) levels. Pharmacogenetic testing revealed poor metabolism of CYP2C19, and N-CLB levels remained elevated and detectable for nearly one year after the discontinuation of treatment with CLB and CNB. Responsive neurostimulator (RNS) implantation within the bilateral centromedian nuclei (CMN) of the thalamus resulted in seizure freedom until N-CLB levels fell, after which there was an 83–93 % reduction in the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTC).\nThe patient is a 26-year-old left-handed female with a history of drug-resistant generalized epilepsy manifesting as typical absence seizures (TA) and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTC). Her seizures began around the age of 12 years old with recurrent TA. Initial treatments with ethosuximide, and then levetiracetam, were not efficacious. Then at the age of 19 years old, she developed GTC. During this time, EEG revealed generalized, frontally predominant, 3 Hz, spike-and-wave discharges. A brain MRI was unremarkable for discrete epileptic lesions. Considering her history, semiology, and diagnostic studies, she was diagnosed with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and the electroclinical syndrome, juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) (\nA–D: Scalp EEG. This figure provides representative scalp EEG epileptiform abnormalities from inpatient video-EEG monitoring. A–C are 15 s epochs of EEG, while\nDespite several antiseizure medication (ASM) trials, including valproate, zonisamide, lamotrigine, brivaracetam, perampanel, lacosamide, and pharmacologic grade cannabidiol, she continued to experience frequent seizures. Additionally, she experienced several treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) from these medications.\nShe was followed in the Corewell Health William Beaumont University Hospital Adult Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and presented to the Emergency Department in early summer 2023 after a breakthrough GTC. Before this seizure and her hospital admission to the hospital, her case had been presented and reviewed at the patient management conference. There was a consensus to proceed with responsive neurostimulator (RNS) implantation with depth electrodes targeting bilateral centromedian nuclei (CMN) of the thalamus.\nAt the time of her admission, her ASM regimen consisted of lamotrigine (LTG) monotherapy with a dose of 700 mg daily. Her baseline seizure frequency was reported as multiple TA per day and 3–7 (average of 5) GTC per month. During the admission, given her ongoing seizures, treatment with clobazam (CLB) was initiated (10 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks, then 20 mg at bedtime). No changes were made to her LTG dose.\nIncreasing daytime somnolence was noted at a follow-up visit one month later. Due to ongoing seizures, CLB was titrated in stepwise fashion every 2 weeks to 40 mg nightly. Approximately one month later, and 2 months after beginning treatment with CLB, responsive neurostimulator (RNS) targeting bilateral CMN was implanted.\nAt the time of RNS implantation, excessive somnolence was reported by her family such that she was sleeping nearly 20 h per day. It was clinically suspected that her somnolence was CLB-related. As such, a transition was initiated from CLB to cenobamate (CNB).\nClobazam dose.\nUnfortunately, somnolence persisted during the CNB titration and after achieving a CNB dose of 200 mg nightly. Although she continued to experience excessive somnolence, during this time, she was seizure-free. Despite her improved seizure frequency, CNB was tapered and discontinued in the fall of 2023.\nLater in the fall of 2023, she required hospitalization for excessive somnolence. At that time, she was only able to stay awake for 2 h per day. However, she remained free of TA and GTC. On admission, her only ASM was LTG 700 mg daily. A brain MRI revealed postsurgical changes from RNS implantation. Routine laboratory studies were unremarkable. Admission LTG level was 10.9 µg/mL (range, 3–12 µg/mL). Despite having discontinued CLB two months earlier (confirmed no prescriptions filled by Michigan Automated Prescription System), she was found to have an N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB) level of 8420 ng/mL (range, 30–3000 ng/mL) and an expectedly undetectable CLB level. Serial CLB and N-CLB levels are outlined in\nClobazam and N-desmethylclobazam levels*.\n*Test performed by Mayo Clinic Laboratories – Rochester Superior Drive, 3050 Superior Drive NW, Rochester, MN 55905.\nShe then completed pharmacogenetic testing, which revealed poor CYP2C19 metabolism with high CYP3A4/5 activity.

In addition, TA seizures recurred. However, she remained free of GTC. Considering her TA recurrence, changes were made to her RNS detection settings. Therapy was also enabled. Details of her RNS detection and therapy settings are outlined in\nResponsive Neurostimulator (RNS) detection settings.\nAbbreviations: Hz – Hertz.\nResponsive Neurostimulator (RNS) therapy settings.\nAbbreviations: LCM – left centromedian nucleus (contacts 1–4, respectively), RCM – right centromedian nucleus (contacts 1–4, respectively), Can – cathode, mA – milliamperes, µs – microseconds, ms – milliseconds, µC/cm\nThree months later, and 8 months after RNS implantation (260 days post-RNS implantation and 91 days after enabling RNS therapy), GTC recurred. Then, as N-CLB levels decreased, GTC increased in frequency such that 15 months post-RNS implantation she was averaging 1 GTC every other month (\nClinical Course. This figure illustrates the clinical course of GTC with respect to treatment with LTG, CLB, and CNB as well as corresponding CLB and N-CLB. The average number of GTC is represented on the Y-axis, and the months are delineated on the X-axis. The dose of LTG remained relatively constant during this time. Treatment with CLB was discontinued in September 2023, and treatment with CNB was discontinued in October 2023. Note the persistently elevated N-CLB corresponded to prolonged freedom from GTC. As the N-CLB began to significantly decrease in March 2024, GTC recurred. Prior to RNS implantation in August 2023, she could have up to 3–7 GTC per month. After RNS implantation and nondetectable N-CLB levels, in November 2024 she averaged 1 GTC every other month.\nA–B: Responsive neurostimulator (RNS) Electrocorticography (ECoG). The recorded GTC was her first GTC after RNS implantation, nearly 9 months after RNS implantation.\nNearly 3 months after enabling RNS therapy, and 15 months after RNS implantation, she had experienced an approximate 90 % reduction in the frequency of GTC. With the resolution of her excessive somnolence and improved GTC frequency, her quality of life was markedly improved. There were discussions to re-challenge lower doses of CLB given the apparent improvement in her seizure frequency from this ASM and RNS therapy settings. However, she and her family were reluctant to restart treatment with CLB. As such, she was maintained on LTG 700 mg daily with optimization of her RNS detection and therapy settings.\nThis case report supports two observations. First, there are profound pharmacokinetic interactions between CLB and CNB that may be exacerbated by genetic polymorphisms. Secondly, there is potential efficacy of RNS in people with drug-resistant IGE and possible synergistic effects of certain ASMs with RNS therapy.\nSpecifically, in this case, a female with drug-resistant IGE experienced excessive somnolence after beginning treatment with CLB. Her somnolence was exacerbated after addition of CNB, and despite discontinuation of both CLB and CNB, N-CLB remained elevated for almost one year. Pharmacogenetic testing revealed poor metabolism via CYP2C19, high activity of CYP3A4, and normal glucuronidation. Her somnolence was correlated with elevated N-CLB levels, and as N-CLB levels fell, her somnolence resolved. Unfortunately, her GTC recurred.. During this time, she also underwent RNS implantation and her most pronounced seizure control occurred during a time of elevated N-CLB levels and enabled RNS therapy.\nClobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine (BZ) with nitrogen located in the 1 and 5 positions of the benzene ring fused to the seven-member ring [\nBoth CLB and N-CLB allosterically bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA\nClobazam has a half-life (t\nCenobamate is a unique ASM that was approved by the US FDA in November 2019 for the treatment of focal epilepsy in patients 18 years old and older [\nPharmacokinetic interactions between CLB, N-CLB, and CNB may be potentiated in individuals with P450 genetic polymorphisms [\nPharmacogenetics is a branch of both pharmacology and genetics that studies inter-individual responses to certain medications [\nSeveral studies have reported CYP2C19 polymorphisms may affect the metabolism of N-CLB [\nThe patient presented in this case report had undetectable CLB levels with N-CLB levels initially measured at three times the upper end of the N-CLB range. Her N-CLB levels then remained supratherapeutic and/or present for nearly 1 year after discontinuing treatment with CLB. Therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude the CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism in combination with an adjunctive trial of CNB led to elevated N-CLB levels and the TRAE. Interestingly, the patient’s overall pharmacogenetic profile may explain the poor efficacy and tolerability of many ASMs apart from LTG. Genes involved in glucuronidation, LTG’s metabolism, were one of the only genes without a mutation and in which normal metabolism was expected.\nIn addition to the profound pharmacokinetic interactions between CLB, N-CLB, and CNB that can be accentuated in individuals with P450 genetic polymorphisms, this case adds to the increasing evidence of the utility of RNS within the CMN of the thalamus in people with drug-resistant IGE [\nIn this case, she continued to experience frequent TA and GTC despite multiple ASM trials. As such, her clinical history was consistent with the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) definition of drug-resistant epilepsy [\nShe underwent RNS implantation within the bilateral CMN of the thalamus in late summer 2023. Before RNS implantation, she could have between 3–7 GTC per month. After RNS implantation, she remained free of GTC off therapy/disabled for 4 months. When RNS therapy was enabled 5 months after implantation (in light of recurrent TA), she remained seizure-free for nearly an additional 4 months. During this time, CLB levels were undetectable but N-CLB levels remained elevated and/or therapeutic (\nThe initial reduction in her seizure frequency, and particularly freedom from GTC, with RNS therapy off/disabled would be within the broad range of the “implantation effect,” which typically lasts 1–5 months [\nCertain ASMs may improve seizure control in patients implanted with RNS [\nSome case series have suggested that N-CLB exhibits greater antiseizure properties than CLB [\nThe patient in this case report had her best seizure control when N-CLB remained elevated, or therapeutic, and RNS therapy was enabled. The improvement in her GTC frequency with elevated and/or therapeutic N-CLB levels may suggest N-CLB, not only CLB, provides a synergistic effect in people receiving RNS therapy. This observation is further supported by GTC recurrence after N-CLB levels were undetectable. At the time of this report, when N-CLB was no longer detectable, she was averaging 1 GTC every other month. Although this was an approximate 83–93 % reduction in her GTC frequency, again, her best seizure control occurred when N-CLB were therapeutic and/or elevated and RNS therapy was enabled.\nThis case report illustrates two clinical considerations. First, there can be pronounced pharmacokinetic interactions with the concomitant use of CLB and CNB. These interactions may be exacerbated in people with P450 genetic polymorphisms, specifically in individuals with mutations to the CYP2C19 isozyme. Secondly, it supports the increasing evidence of the utility of RNS within the bilateral CMN of the thalamus in patients with drug-resistant IGE. Taken together, these observations could suggest N-CLB, and not CLB alone, augments seizure control in patients also treated with RNS.\nThis case report was completed with strict adherence to ethical guidelines, including obtaining informed consent from the patient as well as maintaining confidentiality of protected health information.\nAll authors have read and approved the submitted manuscript.

Considering her history, semiology, and diagnostic studies, she was diagnosed with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and the electroclinical syndrome, juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) (\nA–D: Scalp EEG. This figure provides representative scalp EEG epileptiform abnormalities from inpatient video-EEG monitoring. A–C are 15 s epochs of EEG, while\nDespite several antiseizure medication (ASM) trials, including valproate, zonisamide, lamotrigine, brivaracetam, perampanel, lacosamide, and pharmacologic grade cannabidiol, she continued to experience frequent seizures. Additionally, she experienced several treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) from these medications.\nShe was followed in the Corewell Health William Beaumont University Hospital Adult Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and presented to the Emergency Department in early summer 2023 after a breakthrough GTC. Before this seizure and her hospital admission to the hospital, her case had been presented and reviewed at the patient management conference. There was a consensus to proceed with responsive neurostimulator (RNS) implantation with depth electrodes targeting bilateral centromedian nuclei (CMN) of the thalamus.\nAt the time of her admission, her ASM regimen consisted of lamotrigine (LTG) monotherapy with a dose of 700 mg daily. Her baseline seizure frequency was reported as multiple TA per day and 3–7 (average of 5) GTC per month. During the admission, given her ongoing seizures, treatment with clobazam (CLB) was initiated (10 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks, then 20 mg at bedtime). No changes were made to her LTG dose.\nIncreasing daytime somnolence was noted at a follow-up visit one month later. Due to ongoing seizures, CLB was titrated in stepwise fashion every 2 weeks to 40 mg nightly. Approximately one month later, and 2 months after beginning treatment with CLB, responsive neurostimulator (RNS) targeting bilateral CMN was implanted.\nAt the time of RNS implantation, excessive somnolence was reported by her family such that she was sleeping nearly 20 h per day. It was clinically suspected that her somnolence was CLB-related. As such, a transition was initiated from CLB to cenobamate (CNB).\nClobazam dose.\nUnfortunately, somnolence persisted during the CNB titration and after achieving a CNB dose of 200 mg nightly. Although she continued to experience excessive somnolence, during this time, she was seizure-free. Despite her improved seizure frequency, CNB was tapered and discontinued in the fall of 2023.\nLater in the fall of 2023, she required hospitalization for excessive somnolence. At that time, she was only able to stay awake for 2 h per day. However, she remained free of TA and GTC. On admission, her only ASM was LTG 700 mg daily. A brain MRI revealed postsurgical changes from RNS implantation. Routine laboratory studies were unremarkable. Admission LTG level was 10.9 µg/mL (range, 3–12 µg/mL). Despite having discontinued CLB two months earlier (confirmed no prescriptions filled by Michigan Automated Prescription System), she was found to have an N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB) level of 8420 ng/mL (range, 30–3000 ng/mL) and an expectedly undetectable CLB level. Serial CLB and N-CLB levels are outlined in\nClobazam and N-desmethylclobazam levels*.\n*Test performed by Mayo Clinic Laboratories – Rochester Superior Drive, 3050 Superior Drive NW, Rochester, MN 55905.\nShe then completed pharmacogenetic testing, which revealed poor CYP2C19 metabolism with high CYP3A4/5 activity. Glucuronidation demonstrated normal metabolism. The full results of the pharmacogenetic testing are detailed in\nPharmacogenomic testing\nAbbreviations: NF – normal function, DF – decreased function, PM – poor metabolizer, NM – normal metabolizer, HA – high activity.\nTest performed by Genomind, 2200 Renaissance Blvd #100 King of Prussia, PA 19406.\nApproximately 5 months after RNS implantation, in early winter 2024, her somnolence had improved but she continued to report excessive sleepiness. In addition, TA seizures recurred. However, she remained free of GTC. Considering her TA recurrence, changes were made to her RNS detection settings. Therapy was also enabled. Details of her RNS detection and therapy settings are outlined in\nResponsive Neurostimulator (RNS) detection settings.\nAbbreviations: Hz – Hertz.\nResponsive Neurostimulator (RNS) therapy settings.\nAbbreviations: LCM – left centromedian nucleus (contacts 1–4, respectively), RCM – right centromedian nucleus (contacts 1–4, respectively), Can – cathode, mA – milliamperes, µs – microseconds, ms – milliseconds, µC/cm\nThree months later, and 8 months after RNS implantation (260 days post-RNS implantation and 91 days after enabling RNS therapy), GTC recurred. Then, as N-CLB levels decreased, GTC increased in frequency such that 15 months post-RNS implantation she was averaging 1 GTC every other month (\nClinical Course. This figure illustrates the clinical course of GTC with respect to treatment with LTG, CLB, and CNB as well as corresponding CLB and N-CLB. The average number of GTC is represented on the Y-axis, and the months are delineated on the X-axis. The dose of LTG remained relatively constant during this time. Treatment with CLB was discontinued in September 2023, and treatment with CNB was discontinued in October 2023. Note the persistently elevated N-CLB corresponded to prolonged freedom from GTC. As the N-CLB began to significantly decrease in March 2024, GTC recurred. Prior to RNS implantation in August 2023, she could have up to 3–7 GTC per month. After RNS implantation and nondetectable N-CLB levels, in November 2024 she averaged 1 GTC every other month.\nA–B: Responsive neurostimulator (RNS) Electrocorticography (ECoG). The recorded GTC was her first GTC after RNS implantation, nearly 9 months after RNS implantation.\nNearly 3 months after enabling RNS therapy, and 15 months after RNS implantation, she had experienced an approximate 90 % reduction in the frequency of GTC. With the resolution of her excessive somnolence and improved GTC frequency, her quality of life was markedly improved. There were discussions to re-challenge lower doses of CLB given the apparent improvement in her seizure frequency from this ASM and RNS therapy settings. However, she and her family were reluctant to restart treatment with CLB. As such, she was maintained on LTG 700 mg daily with optimization of her RNS detection and therapy settings.\nThis case report supports two observations. First, there are profound pharmacokinetic interactions between CLB and CNB that may be exacerbated by genetic polymorphisms. Secondly, there is potential efficacy of RNS in people with drug-resistant IGE and possible synergistic effects of certain ASMs with RNS therapy.\nSpecifically, in this case, a female with drug-resistant IGE experienced excessive somnolence after beginning treatment with CLB. Her somnolence was exacerbated after addition of CNB, and despite discontinuation of both CLB and CNB, N-CLB remained elevated for almost one year. Pharmacogenetic testing revealed poor metabolism via CYP2C19, high activity of CYP3A4, and normal glucuronidation. Her somnolence was correlated with elevated N-CLB levels, and as N-CLB levels fell, her somnolence resolved. Unfortunately, her GTC recurred.. During this time, she also underwent RNS implantation and her most pronounced seizure control occurred during a time of elevated N-CLB levels and enabled RNS therapy.\nClobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine (BZ) with nitrogen located in the 1 and 5 positions of the benzene ring fused to the seven-member ring [\nBoth CLB and N-CLB allosterically bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA\nClobazam has a half-life (t\nCenobamate is a unique ASM that was approved by the US FDA in November 2019 for the treatment of focal epilepsy in patients 18 years old and older [\nPharmacokinetic interactions between CLB, N-CLB, and CNB may be potentiated in individuals with P450 genetic polymorphisms [\nPharmacogenetics is a branch of both pharmacology and genetics that studies inter-individual responses to certain medications [\nSeveral studies have reported CYP2C19 polymorphisms may affect the metabolism of N-CLB [\nThe patient presented in this case report had undetectable CLB levels with N-CLB levels initially measured at three times the upper end of the N-CLB range. Her N-CLB levels then remained supratherapeutic and/or present for nearly 1 year after discontinuing treatment with CLB. Therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude the CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism in combination with an adjunctive trial of CNB led to elevated N-CLB levels and the TRAE. Interestingly, the patient’s overall pharmacogenetic profile may explain the poor efficacy and tolerability of many ASMs apart from LTG. Genes involved in glucuronidation, LTG’s metabolism, were one of the only genes without a mutation and in which normal metabolism was expected.\nIn addition to the profound pharmacokinetic interactions between CLB, N-CLB, and CNB that can be accentuated in individuals with P450 genetic polymorphisms, this case adds to the increasing evidence of the utility of RNS within the CMN of the thalamus in people with drug-resistant IGE [\nIn this case, she continued to experience frequent TA and GTC despite multiple ASM trials. As such, her clinical history was consistent with the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) definition of drug-resistant epilepsy [\nShe underwent RNS implantation within the bilateral CMN of the thalamus in late summer 2023. Before RNS implantation, she could have between 3–7 GTC per month. After RNS implantation, she remained free of GTC off therapy/disabled for 4 months. When RNS therapy was enabled 5 months after implantation (in light of recurrent TA), she remained seizure-free for nearly an additional 4 months. During this time, CLB levels were undetectable but N-CLB levels remained elevated and/or therapeutic (\nThe initial reduction in her seizure frequency, and particularly freedom from GTC, with RNS therapy off/disabled would be within the broad range of the “implantation effect,” which typically lasts 1–5 months [\nCertain ASMs may improve seizure control in patients implanted with RNS [\nSome case series have suggested that N-CLB exhibits greater antiseizure properties than CLB [\nThe patient in this case report had her best seizure control when N-CLB remained elevated, or therapeutic, and RNS therapy was enabled. The improvement in her GTC frequency with elevated and/or therapeutic N-CLB levels may suggest N-CLB, not only CLB, provides a synergistic effect in people receiving RNS therapy. This observation is further supported by GTC recurrence after N-CLB levels were undetectable. At the time of this report, when N-CLB was no longer detectable, she was averaging 1 GTC every other month. Although this was an approximate 83–93 % reduction in her GTC frequency, again, her best seizure control occurred when N-CLB were therapeutic and/or elevated and RNS therapy was enabled.\nThis case report illustrates two clinical considerations. First, there can be pronounced pharmacokinetic interactions with the concomitant use of CLB and CNB. These interactions may be exacerbated in people with P450 genetic polymorphisms, specifically in individuals with mutations to the CYP2C19 isozyme. Secondly, it supports the increasing evidence of the utility of RNS within the bilateral CMN of the thalamus in patients with drug-resistant IGE. Taken together, these observations could suggest N-CLB, and not CLB alone, augments seizure control in patients also treated with RNS.\nThis case report was completed with strict adherence to ethical guidelines, including obtaining informed consent from the patient as well as maintaining confidentiality of protected health information.\nAll authors have read and approved the submitted manuscript.
