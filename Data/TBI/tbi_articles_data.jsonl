The prolonged treatment length, continuous delivery, and precise modulation of the radiation beam make tomotherapy one of the ideal therapeutic options for TBI.\nThe Elekta Unity MRL integrates a 1.5T high‐field MRI scanner with a 7 MV flattening filter‐free (FFF) LINAC system. The Monaco treatment planning system (TPS) takes into account the effect of the magnetic field. The excellent soft tissue contrast in 3D MRI enables daily adaptive treatment,\nSeveral limitations render the MRL less than ideal for TBI treatment. The major one is that the maximum field size along the IEC‐y (cranial‐caudal) direction is only 22 cm, and multiple isocenters are, therefore, mandatory for a TBI treatment. It was reported that a dual‐isocentre approach in the MRL could be applied to treating cervical cancer\nIt is mandatory to acquire a 3D MR acquisition in the Unity MRL workflow for fractional plan adaptation, which significantly increases the total treatment time in addition to the beam delivery. The dose rate of 425 MU/min is inherent to the Unity MRL, which may be suboptimal as lower dose rates are desirable in the lung regions.\nThe collimator is not rotatable in the MRL. However, it is less of a problem in this particular clinical application of TBI, as using MLC along the IEC‐y direction may be beneficial in sparing the lungs.\nCompared with conventional linacs, where there is a maximum over‐travel limit for the MLC, the MLC of the MRL can move in the full range in the MRL. For the ring‐mounted Varian Halcyon and Ethos system, the MLC leaves can travel a longer distance to cover the entire field size of 28 cm.\nThe only available dose calculation algorithm for the MRL system is Monte Carlo‐based, and the dose calculation time could be longer than other convolution‐based algorithms. However, it could be a more accurate representation of the dose deposition in tissue inhomogeneities.\nOnly flattening filter‐free beams are available, so intensity modulation is inevitable in the MRL and a simple parallel opposing field approach is not applicable. In addition, patients with MR contraindications could not be treated and MR safety should be assessed for implants or foreign metallic objects. The immobilization devices should be compatible with the MRL system, causing no harm to the patient and producing minimal to no imaging artifacts. All the immobilization devices at our institution are MR‐safe or conditional to enable machine interchangeability after the acquisition of planning CT.\nDespite the challenges and limitations of the MRL system, there are still a few advantages and unique characteristics of using the Elekta Unity machine to treat TBI patients. First, image guidance is available for every segment before beam delivery. The image resolution in MRL can be adjusted with the Monaco 5.51.11 (Elekta, Crawley, UK) and MRI control software Marlin 5.7.1 (Philips, Netherlands). Compared with other clinical applications like Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy of different disease sites in which the MRI scan can take several minutes, a faster pre‐treatment scan with coarser resolution is sufficient for TBI. The 3D MRI acquisition with 2–5 mm resolution may be a practical choice, and a scan time of less than 1 min per isocentre can be achieved. The actual MR scanning time depends on the desired spatial resolution, contrast and signal‐to‐noise ratio.\nThe couch position of the MRL that can be moved to the isocentre is 174 cm (Unity couch index position 43.5), and such an extended couch travel capacity allows most of the patients to be treated in a head‐first‐only orientation and a change to a feet‐first orientation to complete the whole length of TBI is unnecessary. The couch sagging is also unlikely to be a problem as the entire length of the couch is supported inside the bore for every segment, in addition, image guidance is always available to check the final position.\nThe electron return effect due to the presence of the magnetic field\nReal‐time imaging is also available in multiple 2D orthogonal planes to ensure timely beam interruption for sudden movements during treatment. The future upgrade of the system will also enable automatic beam gating.\nThis study addresses the question of whether segTBI in MRL is technically feasible, even with the limitations listed above.\nThis retrospective study was approved by the institutional Clinical Research Ethics Committee. A patient with a height of 137 cm received TBI (12 Gy in 6 fractions twice daily) treatment with a tomotherapy machine at our institution. The CT images were retrospectively planned for multiple isocentre TBI in the MRL system. The patient's knees were bent so that a single plan of length 125 cm could be used to cover the entire body length in the tomotherapy machine. The patient was immobilized using a large Klarity vacuum bag (200 cm × 100 cm) with 120‐liter fill. A large thermoplastic mask was used to fix the head and neck region.\nThe planning CT was acquired using a Siemens Somatom Force scanner with a 5 mm slice thickness, 80 kV\nOptimization structures overlaid on the maximum intensity projection of the CT coronal images. Nine segments are created for optimization. Thinner overlapping slices are shown between the first two segments in the head and neck region. The OARs, including lungs, lenses, and kidneys, are outlined and segmented if needed. The body contour is cropped 3 mm as the PTV.\nThe kidneys and lung structures were contracted 5 mm and referred to as Kidneys_OAR and Lungs_OAR, respectively, from the original structures for optimization and evaluation. The PTV was cropped 3 mm from the external body contour. The PTV Body_net structure is the PTV subtracting the lenses, kidneys and lungs for evaluation. Every PTV or OAR within two slices (1 cm) in the overlapping region was contoured, except that in the head and neck region, each 5 mm slice was contoured as shown in Figure\nDuring the optimization process, the PTV and OAR in the planning and adjacent segments were assigned optimization constraints. There were 15–17 beams in each segment. Optimization with dose gradients as base dose forced the subsequent segments to deliver a dose distribution with a gradual fall‐off of about 2 Gy or 16% of the prescribed dose per cm in the junction regions. In order to speed up the optimization process, the plans for each segment were first optimized with around 80 CT slices with a bias dose planning function in Monaco using a 5 mm grid size and 1% statistical uncertainty. The planning parameters controlling the details for control points were adjusted manually during the plan optimization process to minimize the treatment delivery time while ensuring the dose criteria could be met. The optimization constraints and sequencing parameters for optimization are shown in Figure\nThe option “autoflash” in Monaco was set to 1 cm to control MLC shaping, improve dose distribution robustness against possible setup errors, and account for intra‐fractional motion.

The tolerance and action limits of the gamma passing rate follow the recommendation of AAPM TG Report 218.\nTo evaluate the dosimetric impact of a potential shift in the cranial‐caudal direction, segment 2 was shifted by 5 mm and 1 cm in the caudal direction, and the dose was re‐calculated.\nAn anthropomorphic adult female phantom (ATOM, Sun Nuclear) consists of 38 horizontal sections, each 25 mm thick, and holes drilled 14 mm in diameter for insertion of optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters (OSLDs). The locations of the holes represent the positions of different organs. The organs were contoured to mimic the clinical scenario, and a TBI plan with seven isocentres was created with the same optimization constraints listed in Table\nThe OSLD system (RadPro International System GmbH) comprises an OSL reader, an eraser, and OSLDs made from beryllium oxide, with a 4.65 mm × 4.65 mm × 0.5 mm sensitive element encapsulated with a holder. The OSLDs were calibrated and calibration factors for each OSLD were obtained by irradiating 2 Gy using the 6 MV FFF Tomotherapy machine. The beam quality correction factor was taken as unity in our internal tests, which aligns with the findings of other studies.\nThe TBI plan was recalculated using the CT Image set reconstructed with a 2 mm slice thickness and 40 OSLDs (16 in soft tissue, 10 in lung, eight in brain, and six in bone tissue plugs) inserted throughout the body. Representative sections are shown in Figure\nThe anthropomorphic phantom with through‐holes drilled for the insertion of plugs containing OSLDs. Three representative horizontal sections for the head, thorax, and pelvis regions are shown with insertion of plugs mimicking brain tissue (yellow), lungs (pink), soft tissue (grey) and bone tissues (brown).\nAs the phantom is not visible in MRI, only the MR markers were used to aid in the positioning of the phantom on the Unity. Bottles of solutions were placed next to the phantom to provide an adequate signal during each MR acquisition, and these bottles were removed before irradiation. Plan adaptation was not performed and one fraction of the original segments of the reference plan were delivered.\nThe OSLDs were dried and placed in a drying cabinet for 3 h before reading. The data were then compared with the mean dose of the OSLD ROIs reported by the TPS.\nThe pediatric patient plans were generated using nine segments, and the dose distribution is shown in Figure\nCoronal, sagittal, and axial plane for the dose distribution of the plan sum of the patient plan.\nTable\nSummary of the plan delivery and the plan‐specific QA results by ArcCheck measurement.\nThe mid‐sagittal dose planes are displayed in Figure\nSagittal dose plane of the mid‐line of individual segments of the patient plan. Apart from the dose feathering effects, the increase in skin dose can also be observed in the out‐of‐field regions in individual segments.\n(a) Dose profile for individual segments and the plan sum along y‐direction at the mid‐position of the patient. The overlapping dose gradients are about 5 cm in individual segments. (b) The dose profiles of segment 2 were re‐calculated after drifting 5 mm and 1 cm in the caudal direction. Segments 7–9 are not shown in the diagram as there is no dose in the mid‐sagittal plane.\nThe CT image of the phantom is displayed in Figure\nDosimetric results: comparison between OSLD and TPS.\nOne of the main limitations of using the MRL for TBI patients is the lengthy time for planning and treatment. However, efficiency can be significantly increased after the standard template is created. Automated processes such as scripting\nFor beams incident on oblique tissue‐air interfaces, secondary electrons entering the air will have trajectories following the direction of the main magnetic field, which is the cranial‐caudal direction.\nThe gradients could be formed in most regions along the desired caudal cranial directions. In the initial attempts in planning the pediatric patient plan, however, it was found that electron density inhomogeneities due to air and bones in the head and neck region made it challenging for the optimizer to form a gradient along a single direction only. Setting minimum and maximum dose constraints to a slab often led to heterogeneous in‐plane dose distribution. To better control the cross‐plane dose gradients, slices were created in a 5 mm step instead of 1 cm in the overlapping region between the first and second segments. The length of the feathering zone was a balance between the vulnerability to a possible shift in that direction and the number of isocenters to be used. Segment 2 was chosen to shift towards the caudal direction to mainly evaluate how the dose coverage and mean lung dose would be affected. The overlapping length was designed to be 5 cm in this study, and the optimization tended to increase the dose coverage as long as the OAR constraints were not violated. Even with a 1 cm shift for segment 2 in this study, the mean lung dose differed by less than 5% in Table\nMR assessment must be performed before a patient can be treated in the MRL. Although the couch can move up to 174 cm, the patient height would determine the number of isocentres required. As the maximum field width in the IEC‐x direction is 57.4 cm, the width of the patient would not significantly affect the treatment time. The placement of the MR coil only allows about 35 cm separation in the IEC‐z direction, limiting the extent of knee bending and the thickness of the vacuum bag. A Unity clearance tool, as shown in Figure\nDose verification in the presence of magnetic field has been challenging as the presence of small submillimeter air gaps around the dosimeters could lead to a significant dose difference.\nOne limitation of this study is that only one subject was involved, similar to previous studies.\nThe current study is a planning study, and the plan‐specific QA of individual segments was performed using ArcCHECK. Further investigation on dosimetric verification of the plan sum is warranted in future studies.\nThe MRL is capable of performing real‐time imaging and ensuring an accurate dose delivery while providing dose modulation in a TBI treatment. Nevertheless, the duration was still considerably longer than other modalities, including tomotherapy, and therefore, the MRL was used only as a backup machine in our institution practically. Also, a previous report\nThis study has demonstrated that SegTBI on the MRL is technically feasible. Implementation of automatic processing may shorten the planning and treatment time in the future.\nThe authors confirm their contribution to the paper as follows: Study conception and design: Ashley Chi Kin Cheng, Louis Lee.

Older adults often have one or more comorbidities and are often on anticoagulants, beta-blockers or central nervous system-influencing drugs that predispose them to falls and worse traumatic intracranial haemorrhages(\nThe Delphi process is a well-established method to reach a consensus when empirical evidence is not available to answer a particular question. Because of the magnitude of this healthcare problem, the EANS (European Association of Neurosurgical Societies) Trauma and Critical Care Section has decided to try to reach a consensus on relevant topics in the diagnosis, management and care of the older adults suffering TBI.\nA 3-round modified Delphi study was conducted consisting of a 2-round online Delphi questionnaire followed by an in-person online consensus meeting between May 2023 and November 2024. The preliminary statements were drafted by a working group from the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) Trauma and Critical care Section, composed of neurosurgeons, based on a literature review and internal group discussions. These statements were grouped in different subheadings covering different aspects of TBI definition, diagnosis and management. Participants’ consent was obtained at the first round by explicitly acknowledging voluntary participation and use of the data collected.\nExperts were recruited through the EANS Trauma and Critical Care Section, the Spanish Society of Neurosurgery (SENEC), the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) and the International Neurotrauma Society (INTS). Invitees had to be neurotrauma specialists with at least 5 years of work experience, either as neurosurgeon, intensivist or emergency physician. The panel was finally constituted by response to a small questionnaire including specific consent on data usage and participation. The panel was finally composed of 72 experts. Most of them were neurosurgeons (54, 75 %), followed by neuro-intensivists (15, 21 %) and emergency physicians (3, 4 %). Europe was the most common region of origin of the experts (59, 82 % of the experts), followed by North America (6, 8 %), Asia (4, 6 %), Africa (2, 3 %) and South America (1, 1 %).\nTwo iterative rounds of online questionnaires were distributed though the REDCAP platform. The experts were requested to rate their agreement with statements by means of a Likert scale from 1 to 8. Consensus was defined as >75 % agreement. Responses with >75 % agreement and statements with more than 75 % rating of the three lowest or three highest Likert scores in round 1 were resubmitted to the experts in the second round, with the option to agree or disagree (to confirm consensus). The statements with >50 % and ≤75 % rating of the three lowest or three highest Likert scores were resubmitted without change along with the average and personal scores (i.e. each participant can compare their individual scores with the averages of the group in order to stimulate agreement). If there was ≤50 % agreement, the statement was considered as resulting in no consensus.\nFor questions on age limits, results of round 1 presented a distribution without consensus being reached. The results were included in round 2 in order to aim for a narrower distribution.\nFollowing the second Delphi round, 15 statements ended in between no-consensus and consensus. In an online meeting, these statements were rephrased in an open discussion and immediately submitted to the panel for anonymous voting in favor or against the rephrased statement. Consensus was reached if 75 % of the attending panelists voted in favor.\nDescriptive statistics were performed with SPSS software. Quantitative data were analyzed obtaining medians and interquartile (IQ) range. The effect of comorbidities in age definitions were analyzed using nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon Rank sum test). The data associated with the study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nIn the first online round 72 experts evaluated 62 statements divided into different thematic areas corresponding to main areas of discussion on TBI in the older adults (\nOverview of the 4 round Delphi study process.\nThe statements were organized by thematic areas. The statements and proposals and the proportion of agreement in the different rounds of the Delphi process are presented in\nSummary of statements in which consensus was obtained.\nThe definition of old age should include calendar age, systemic comorbidity, frailty and the level of independence, as these factors collectively influence the individual impact of ageing. The age at which experts define older adulthood is significantly modified by the presence of comorbidities (without comorbidities median age 75 years; IQ range = 70–80; with comorbidities median age 65, IQ range 65–70; p < 0.001) (\nQuantitative age limits for definition of older adult age and surgical treatment.\nA frailty assessment tool seems necessary when assessing older adults suffering trauma and it would be desirable to have a specific, standardized and easy to use tool for this group of patients. Information regarding comorbidities and ongoing treatments should be obtained to better assess the patient's condition after TBI through interviews with relatives and consultation of general practitioner's notes. Neurosurgeons should be consulted for any older adult with proven TBI and traumatic Computerized Tomography (CT) abnormalities.\nExperts agreed on the main clinical decision rules for the diagnostic management of mild TBI and CT prescription in older adults. However, the use of biomarkers to supplement these clinical decision rules is still a matter of debate, as there was agreement on the need for a clear guideline for the use of biomarkers as screening tools to guide CT prescription in this population. Experts disagreed in general on the readiness of biomarkers as guides for CT prescription or outcome prediction after mild TBI in this population.\nIn terms of neurosurgical treatment, the experts disagreed on the general application of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines for hematoma evacuation in older adults as in younger patients without exception. The experts signalled a more individualized approach by agreeing on a more conservative treatment of acute subdural hematomas in certain situations (assuming a stable Glasgow coma scale(GCS) > 12) and by agreeing on a less aggressive or more conservative approach in the neurosurgical treatment of older adults. There was agreement on deciding on whether to monitor or not intracranial pressure (ICP) depending on GCS as well as on CT scan findings of atrophy and mass effect. There was also agreement on discussing treatment withdrawal decisions with families in patients with relevant comorbidities or high preinjury frailty in whom poor outcome is strongly expected. There was no agreement regarding determining an age limit for craniotomy for hematoma evacuation, but experts agreed on the presence of an age limit regarding both primary and secondary decompressive craniectomy. This age limit was also significantly affected by the presence of comorbidities (\nRegarding management strategies, experts disagreed with repeating CT scan in all older adult TBI patients. However, the panel preferred a more individualized approach rather than general recommendations based solely on age. They emphasized that decisions on whether to repeat a CT scan should depend on several factors, including the patient's clinical condition, initial CT findings, and co-morbidities, rather than being driven by age alone. This individualized approach ensures that repeat imaging is conducted only when clinically justified, avoiding unnecessary procedures that may not benefit the patient. In general, the experts agreed on repeating CT scan in patients with significant posttraumatic changes (symptoms or neurological examination), all contusions and subdural hematomas, and even after minor clinical changes in patients on antithrombotics.

The panel strongly recommended that such protocols be readily available to all physicians involved in the care of older adult TBI patients, ensuring timely and consistent care.\nThere was disagreement on the administration of platelets to patients on antiplatelet agents with significant hemorrhagic findings and on reverting anticoagulation only when there is a need for surgery. For the management in the intensive care unit (ICU), there is agreement on maintaining the same thresholds for ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure(CPP) as in the younger patients, and there is also a need for individualized management based on autoregulatory status.

Older adults often have one or more comorbidities and are often on anticoagulants, beta-blockers or central nervous system-influencing drugs that predispose them to falls and worse traumatic intracranial haemorrhages(\nThe Delphi process is a well-established method to reach a consensus when empirical evidence is not available to answer a particular question. Because of the magnitude of this healthcare problem, the EANS (European Association of Neurosurgical Societies) Trauma and Critical Care Section has decided to try to reach a consensus on relevant topics in the diagnosis, management and care of the older adults suffering TBI.\nA 3-round modified Delphi study was conducted consisting of a 2-round online Delphi questionnaire followed by an in-person online consensus meeting between May 2023 and November 2024. The preliminary statements were drafted by a working group from the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) Trauma and Critical care Section, composed of neurosurgeons, based on a literature review and internal group discussions. These statements were grouped in different subheadings covering different aspects of TBI definition, diagnosis and management. Participants’ consent was obtained at the first round by explicitly acknowledging voluntary participation and use of the data collected.\nExperts were recruited through the EANS Trauma and Critical Care Section, the Spanish Society of Neurosurgery (SENEC), the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) and the International Neurotrauma Society (INTS). Invitees had to be neurotrauma specialists with at least 5 years of work experience, either as neurosurgeon, intensivist or emergency physician. The panel was finally constituted by response to a small questionnaire including specific consent on data usage and participation. The panel was finally composed of 72 experts. Most of them were neurosurgeons (54, 75 %), followed by neuro-intensivists (15, 21 %) and emergency physicians (3, 4 %). Europe was the most common region of origin of the experts (59, 82 % of the experts), followed by North America (6, 8 %), Asia (4, 6 %), Africa (2, 3 %) and South America (1, 1 %).\nTwo iterative rounds of online questionnaires were distributed though the REDCAP platform. The experts were requested to rate their agreement with statements by means of a Likert scale from 1 to 8. Consensus was defined as >75 % agreement. Responses with >75 % agreement and statements with more than 75 % rating of the three lowest or three highest Likert scores in round 1 were resubmitted to the experts in the second round, with the option to agree or disagree (to confirm consensus). The statements with >50 % and ≤75 % rating of the three lowest or three highest Likert scores were resubmitted without change along with the average and personal scores (i.e. each participant can compare their individual scores with the averages of the group in order to stimulate agreement). If there was ≤50 % agreement, the statement was considered as resulting in no consensus.\nFor questions on age limits, results of round 1 presented a distribution without consensus being reached. The results were included in round 2 in order to aim for a narrower distribution.\nFollowing the second Delphi round, 15 statements ended in between no-consensus and consensus. In an online meeting, these statements were rephrased in an open discussion and immediately submitted to the panel for anonymous voting in favor or against the rephrased statement. Consensus was reached if 75 % of the attending panelists voted in favor.\nDescriptive statistics were performed with SPSS software. Quantitative data were analyzed obtaining medians and interquartile (IQ) range. The effect of comorbidities in age definitions were analyzed using nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon Rank sum test). The data associated with the study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nIn the first online round 72 experts evaluated 62 statements divided into different thematic areas corresponding to main areas of discussion on TBI in the older adults (\nOverview of the 4 round Delphi study process.\nThe statements were organized by thematic areas. The statements and proposals and the proportion of agreement in the different rounds of the Delphi process are presented in\nSummary of statements in which consensus was obtained.\nThe definition of old age should include calendar age, systemic comorbidity, frailty and the level of independence, as these factors collectively influence the individual impact of ageing. The age at which experts define older adulthood is significantly modified by the presence of comorbidities (without comorbidities median age 75 years; IQ range = 70–80; with comorbidities median age 65, IQ range 65–70; p < 0.001) (\nQuantitative age limits for definition of older adult age and surgical treatment.\nA frailty assessment tool seems necessary when assessing older adults suffering trauma and it would be desirable to have a specific, standardized and easy to use tool for this group of patients. Information regarding comorbidities and ongoing treatments should be obtained to better assess the patient's condition after TBI through interviews with relatives and consultation of general practitioner's notes. Neurosurgeons should be consulted for any older adult with proven TBI and traumatic Computerized Tomography (CT) abnormalities.\nExperts agreed on the main clinical decision rules for the diagnostic management of mild TBI and CT prescription in older adults. However, the use of biomarkers to supplement these clinical decision rules is still a matter of debate, as there was agreement on the need for a clear guideline for the use of biomarkers as screening tools to guide CT prescription in this population. Experts disagreed in general on the readiness of biomarkers as guides for CT prescription or outcome prediction after mild TBI in this population.\nIn terms of neurosurgical treatment, the experts disagreed on the general application of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines for hematoma evacuation in older adults as in younger patients without exception. The experts signalled a more individualized approach by agreeing on a more conservative treatment of acute subdural hematomas in certain situations (assuming a stable Glasgow coma scale(GCS) > 12) and by agreeing on a less aggressive or more conservative approach in the neurosurgical treatment of older adults. There was agreement on deciding on whether to monitor or not intracranial pressure (ICP) depending on GCS as well as on CT scan findings of atrophy and mass effect. There was also agreement on discussing treatment withdrawal decisions with families in patients with relevant comorbidities or high preinjury frailty in whom poor outcome is strongly expected. There was no agreement regarding determining an age limit for craniotomy for hematoma evacuation, but experts agreed on the presence of an age limit regarding both primary and secondary decompressive craniectomy. This age limit was also significantly affected by the presence of comorbidities (\nRegarding management strategies, experts disagreed with repeating CT scan in all older adult TBI patients.

Current Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines advocate a fixed lower CPP threshold of 40–50 mmHg—presumed to represent the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA)—based primarily on retrospective analyses. Whether cerebrovascular autoregulation informed CPP targets are more closely associated to outcome compared to the fixed thresholds, remains debated.\nUsing data obtained from the STARSHIP study (“Studying Trends in AutoRegulation in Severe Head Injury in Paediatrics”) and employing rigorous statistical methods, including ordinal analyses, this investigation demonstrates that CPP deviations below the LLA have potential to be explored as prognostic markers. In contrast, deviations from the fixed CPP thresholds recommended by the BTF did not show the same predictive power in this study. The LLA varied both with patient age and dynamically during the course of TBI, with higher LLA values observed in individuals who ultimately experience unfavourable outcomes.\nThese findings suggest that the current recommended fixed lower CPP limit of 40–50 mmHg is likely too low for most children, regardless of age. The evidence generated in this study offers a basis for further external validation and will inform Phase II trials aimed at refining CPP targets in paediatric TBI.\nCerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is a critical metric in the management of paediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI). CPP is the driving pressure for blood flow through the cerebrovascular bed and is calculated as the mathematical difference between arterial blood pressure (ABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP). CPP management is pivotal for sustaining a sufficient cerebral blood flow and consequently for sustaining brain metabolism and function. Current Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines recommend CPPs above a fixed minimum (i.e., lower limit) of 40–50 mmHg (with higher minimum values for older children).\nThe state of cerebrovascular autoregulation can be assessed using the pressure reactivity index (PRx), a widely used index in adult neurocritical care.\nAlthough preliminary studies suggest that autoregulation-informed CPP targets may hold promise for improving prognostication following paediatric TBI, the identification of optimal CPP thresholds in this population remains critically understudied. Accordingly, one of the secondary objectives of the initial STARSHIP study analysis plan\nSTARSHIP represents the first prospective multi-centre observational study to assess cerebrovascular autoregulation in paediatric head injury.\nThe inclusion criteria for the STARSHIP study were as follows: age ≤16 years, admission to intensive care with TBI (defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤8 with TBI-related pathology confirmed by neuroimaging), and invasive monitoring of ICP and ABP. No exclusion criteria were applied. The management across the different centres, which includes ICP and CPP management, largely aligns with the BTF guidelines.\nInformed consent for the study, and additional consent for follow-up was obtained by patient's parents/guardians. STARSHIP was approved by the Health Research Authority, South West-Central Bristol Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 18/SW/0053, 23/SW/0011).\nData acquisition, curation, and processing were performed as previously described.\nPatient outcomes were evaluated using two measures: (1) mortality at the time of discharge and (2) functional outcomes at 12 months, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended Paediatric Revision (GOS-E Peds). The GOS-E Peds assessments were conducted either in person during outpatient visits or via telephone interviews. Mortality data at discharge was available for all 135 patients, while 12-month GOS-E Peds scores were recorded for 124 patients. The GOS-E Peds scale ranges from 1 (upper good recovery) to 8 (death). For outcome analysis, the 12-month GOS-E Peds scores were categorised as either favourable (scores 1–4) or unfavourable (scores 5–8).\nCPPopt was calculated as the CPP corresponding to the lowest PRx value, determined by fitting a parabolic curve to 5-min median CPP and PRx values. CPP bins were set at 2.5 mmHg, with additional heuristic algorithmic details as previously described.\nStatistical analyses and figure preparation were performed using R studio software (version 4.4.1:\nTo investigate the relationship between various CPPopt and LLA metrics and outcome, the variables were investigated with univariable analysis using Mann Whitney's (Wilcoxon rank) test for both mortality at discharge, and dichotomised outcome at 12 months post-ictus. The cohort median and interquartile range (IQR) are reported for the various metrics. Due to limited sample size in the non-survivor group (10 patients), multivariable regression was conducted on 124 patients with dichotomised 12-month outcomes as the endpoint. As CPPopt was not significantly different between outcome groups, only LLA was explored further. To allow for exploration of the ordinal range of the GOSE-P, a sliding dichotomy approach was performed to account for initial clinical severity in line with the previous description by Roozenbeek et al.\nTo further explore LLA, the temporal dynamics of LLA were visualised using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing, stratified by patient outcome. Subsequently, mixed-effects models were constructed to statistically assess differences in LLA trajectories by outcome, incorporating outcome as the dependent variable, LLA and monitoring day as fixed effects, and patient ID as a random effect to account for individual variability in baseline trajectories. Second, considering that LLA thresholds are inherently patient-specific and that younger patients likely require lower CPP targets,\nLastly, we directly compared LLA derived metrics to CPP targets suggested by the BTF. Specifically, we first assessed their performance within univariable Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, specifically looking at the area under the curve (AUC) and the associated 95% CI. Additionally, we explored whether significant monitoring-based metrics improved prognostic models that included readily available clinical parameters (represented by the prognostic risk scores described previously). The added value of these metrics was quantified using the continuous Net Reclassification Index,\nThe funders or the sponsor did not have any role in the collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; or decision to submit the manuscript for publication, the right to veto publication or control the decision regarding which journal the manuscript was submitted.\n135 children with paediatric TBI requiring invasive monitoring were included in this analysis; the STARSHIP cohort has been previously described.\nPatient characteristics.\nAbbreviations: GCS = Glasgow coma scale, AIS = Abbreviated injury score, ISS= Injury severity score.\nData shown as number (%) or median (interquartile range).\nThe univariable analysis is described in\nSummary metrics of CPPopt and LLA, including dose variables, for the cohort, and by mortality and dichotomous outcome groups.\nAbbreviations: CPPopt = optimal CPP, Δ = delta, CPP = cerebral perfusion pressure, ptime = percentage time, LLA = lower limit of autoregulation, N = number of patients.\nData shown as median (interquartile range).\nSliding dichotomy approach.\nThe results of the multivariable logistic regression considering LLA metrics and ICP for the prediction of the covariate adjusted outcome definition is shown using odds ratios and corresponding confidence intervals.\nAbbreviations: ICP = intracranial pressure; ptime = percentage time, LLA = lower limit of autoregulation, N = number of patients.\nThe derived odds ratios are displayed for every 1000 mmHg∗h dose, 10 mmHg hourly dose, and 5% ptime.\nThe temporal profile of LLA by outcome group is shown in\nIn the next step, we compared autoregulation informed CPP targets to the fixed target suggested by the BTF. When assessing the value of the different targets within univariable ROC curves for the prediction of unfavourable outcomes, the AUCs of dose and ptime below a fixed CPP target of 50 mmHg displayed low AUC with the corresponding CI crossing 0.5 suggesting no prognostic relevance (AUC of 0.57 [CI 0.46–0.68] for dose and 0.56 [CI 0.46–0.68] for ptime). Conversely both hourly dose (AUC of 0.70 [CI 0.51–0.73]) and ptime (AUC of 0.68 [CI 0.54–0.75]) below LLA displayed discriminatory value with a univariable accuracy of 0.68 for both hourly dose and ptime. Lastly, we assessed whether adding the different LLA metrics would improve the diagnostic performance compared to models including clinical parameters only. The receiver operating characteristics AUCs considering either only clinical parameters or clinical parameters + LLA hourly dose or clinical parameters + LLA ptime are shown in\nUsing the largest prospective multicentre observational multimodality monitoring database of paediatric TBI to date, we characterised the associations between different CPP targets for prognostication. Specifically, we explored the fixed targets proposed by the BTF, and the autoregulation informed targets CPPopt and LLA. The main results showed the following: Deviations from CPPopt were not associated with outcome. Conversely, deviations from the LLA were associated with outcome, even after adjustment for relevant clinical prognostic parameters. The LLA changed dynamically after the initial injury and tended to increase in patients with unfavourable outcomes. Furthermore, with increasing age, the fixed CPP targets recommended by the BTF deviated increasingly from the LLA. Overall, dynamic assessment of deviations from the LLA appeared superior to evaluating deviations from the fixed BTF targets. Incorporating LLA metrics into models that include clinical parameters should be tested further to support their diagnostic performance.\nUsing diverse statistical methods and metrics that incorporate both the intensity and percentage time during which CPP falls below various CPP targets, we highlight the clinical potential of the LLA. Conversely, deviations from CPPopt, as well as from the fixed CPP targets proposed by the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF), did not convey meaningful prognostic information in our analysis. While explorations assessing autoregulation informed CPP targets in paediatric TBI remain scarce, previous explorations in retrospective datasets with fewer patients have also described the association between CPP below autoregulation informed CPP targets and outcome.\nFrom a clinical perspective, it is important to note that the LLA is both patient specific and dynamically variable over time. The temporal profile of LLA demonstrated that individuals with favourable outcomes exhibited a relatively stable LLA (consistently around 55 mmHg). In contrast, patients with unfavourable outcomes demonstrated significant temporal variability in LLA: initially similar to the favourable group at approximately 55 mmHg on day 0, their LLA subsequently increased, reaching nearly 60 mmHg by day 5. This pattern highlights an increased CPP requirement to maintain adequate cerebral blood flow and suggests the clinical importance of closely monitoring the dynamic behaviour of LLA, especially in patients at risk of unfavourable outcomes.\nCurrent guidelines suggest fixed targets between 40 and 50 mmHg, emphasising that younger patients likely require lower CPP targets compared to adolescents.\nOur analyses are limited to a relatively small sample size (n = 135) with insufficient numbers for age-stratified analyses. Yet, LLA remained a promising target even after correction for the known prognostic parameters. As most research on PRx derived targets has been performed in adult TBI cohorts, the parameters used for estimation of CPPopt and LLA are derived from the adult cohort, adjusted for the paediatric physiology. Whether these represent the optimal parameters remains to be explored. A notable consideration of this analysis is the use of a PRx threshold of 0.2 for LLA calculation. The primary STARSHIP analysis suggested that a PRx threshold of 0 was best for predicting outcome, but mortality-based assessments were not possible owing to low death numbers. When exploring a PRx threshold for LLA estimation, a threshold that reflects\nImportantly, as this study represents a secondary analysis of observational data, we did not have detailed information regarding specific therapies administered to modify CPP. Patient management across the participating centres generally adhered to BTF guidelines, encompassing both CPP and ICP control. Thus, our analysis primarily captures secondary deviations from these standard targets–deviations that were likely unavoidable even under optimal clinical care. Additionally, although CPP can often be augmented through therapeutic interventions, the personalised targets (CPPopt and LLA, both based on PRx application) remain independent of the immediate CPP value, as they reflect the underlying state of cerebral autoregulation. Despite carefully adjusting for various established prognostic covariates, our analysis remains observational and therefore identifies associations rather than causal relationships. Prospective interventional studies are needed to validate the clinical utility of LLA and to determine whether actively targeting LLA leads to improved outcomes or improved prognostication.\nAll authors had full access to all the data in the study and accept responsibility to submit for publication.

Accordingly, one of the secondary objectives of the initial STARSHIP study analysis plan\nSTARSHIP represents the first prospective multi-centre observational study to assess cerebrovascular autoregulation in paediatric head injury.\nThe inclusion criteria for the STARSHIP study were as follows: age ≤16 years, admission to intensive care with TBI (defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤8 with TBI-related pathology confirmed by neuroimaging), and invasive monitoring of ICP and ABP. No exclusion criteria were applied. The management across the different centres, which includes ICP and CPP management, largely aligns with the BTF guidelines.\nInformed consent for the study, and additional consent for follow-up was obtained by patient's parents/guardians. STARSHIP was approved by the Health Research Authority, South West-Central Bristol Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 18/SW/0053, 23/SW/0011).\nData acquisition, curation, and processing were performed as previously described.\nPatient outcomes were evaluated using two measures: (1) mortality at the time of discharge and (2) functional outcomes at 12 months, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended Paediatric Revision (GOS-E Peds). The GOS-E Peds assessments were conducted either in person during outpatient visits or via telephone interviews. Mortality data at discharge was available for all 135 patients, while 12-month GOS-E Peds scores were recorded for 124 patients. The GOS-E Peds scale ranges from 1 (upper good recovery) to 8 (death). For outcome analysis, the 12-month GOS-E Peds scores were categorised as either favourable (scores 1–4) or unfavourable (scores 5–8).\nCPPopt was calculated as the CPP corresponding to the lowest PRx value, determined by fitting a parabolic curve to 5-min median CPP and PRx values. CPP bins were set at 2.5 mmHg, with additional heuristic algorithmic details as previously described.\nStatistical analyses and figure preparation were performed using R studio software (version 4.4.1:\nTo investigate the relationship between various CPPopt and LLA metrics and outcome, the variables were investigated with univariable analysis using Mann Whitney's (Wilcoxon rank) test for both mortality at discharge, and dichotomised outcome at 12 months post-ictus. The cohort median and interquartile range (IQR) are reported for the various metrics. Due to limited sample size in the non-survivor group (10 patients), multivariable regression was conducted on 124 patients with dichotomised 12-month outcomes as the endpoint. As CPPopt was not significantly different between outcome groups, only LLA was explored further. To allow for exploration of the ordinal range of the GOSE-P, a sliding dichotomy approach was performed to account for initial clinical severity in line with the previous description by Roozenbeek et al.\nTo further explore LLA, the temporal dynamics of LLA were visualised using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing, stratified by patient outcome. Subsequently, mixed-effects models were constructed to statistically assess differences in LLA trajectories by outcome, incorporating outcome as the dependent variable, LLA and monitoring day as fixed effects, and patient ID as a random effect to account for individual variability in baseline trajectories. Second, considering that LLA thresholds are inherently patient-specific and that younger patients likely require lower CPP targets,\nLastly, we directly compared LLA derived metrics to CPP targets suggested by the BTF. Specifically, we first assessed their performance within univariable Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, specifically looking at the area under the curve (AUC) and the associated 95% CI. Additionally, we explored whether significant monitoring-based metrics improved prognostic models that included readily available clinical parameters (represented by the prognostic risk scores described previously). The added value of these metrics was quantified using the continuous Net Reclassification Index,\nThe funders or the sponsor did not have any role in the collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; or decision to submit the manuscript for publication, the right to veto publication or control the decision regarding which journal the manuscript was submitted.\n135 children with paediatric TBI requiring invasive monitoring were included in this analysis; the STARSHIP cohort has been previously described.\nPatient characteristics.\nAbbreviations: GCS = Glasgow coma scale, AIS = Abbreviated injury score, ISS= Injury severity score.\nData shown as number (%) or median (interquartile range).\nThe univariable analysis is described in\nSummary metrics of CPPopt and LLA, including dose variables, for the cohort, and by mortality and dichotomous outcome groups.\nAbbreviations: CPPopt = optimal CPP, Δ = delta, CPP = cerebral perfusion pressure, ptime = percentage time, LLA = lower limit of autoregulation, N = number of patients.\nData shown as median (interquartile range).\nSliding dichotomy approach.\nThe results of the multivariable logistic regression considering LLA metrics and ICP for the prediction of the covariate adjusted outcome definition is shown using odds ratios and corresponding confidence intervals.\nAbbreviations: ICP = intracranial pressure; ptime = percentage time, LLA = lower limit of autoregulation, N = number of patients.\nThe derived odds ratios are displayed for every 1000 mmHg∗h dose, 10 mmHg hourly dose, and 5% ptime.\nThe temporal profile of LLA by outcome group is shown in\nIn the next step, we compared autoregulation informed CPP targets to the fixed target suggested by the BTF. When assessing the value of the different targets within univariable ROC curves for the prediction of unfavourable outcomes, the AUCs of dose and ptime below a fixed CPP target of 50 mmHg displayed low AUC with the corresponding CI crossing 0.5 suggesting no prognostic relevance (AUC of 0.57 [CI 0.46–0.68] for dose and 0.56 [CI 0.46–0.68] for ptime). Conversely both hourly dose (AUC of 0.70 [CI 0.51–0.73]) and ptime (AUC of 0.68 [CI 0.54–0.75]) below LLA displayed discriminatory value with a univariable accuracy of 0.68 for both hourly dose and ptime. Lastly, we assessed whether adding the different LLA metrics would improve the diagnostic performance compared to models including clinical parameters only. The receiver operating characteristics AUCs considering either only clinical parameters or clinical parameters + LLA hourly dose or clinical parameters + LLA ptime are shown in\nUsing the largest prospective multicentre observational multimodality monitoring database of paediatric TBI to date, we characterised the associations between different CPP targets for prognostication. Specifically, we explored the fixed targets proposed by the BTF, and the autoregulation informed targets CPPopt and LLA. The main results showed the following: Deviations from CPPopt were not associated with outcome. Conversely, deviations from the LLA were associated with outcome, even after adjustment for relevant clinical prognostic parameters. The LLA changed dynamically after the initial injury and tended to increase in patients with unfavourable outcomes. Furthermore, with increasing age, the fixed CPP targets recommended by the BTF deviated increasingly from the LLA. Overall, dynamic assessment of deviations from the LLA appeared superior to evaluating deviations from the fixed BTF targets. Incorporating LLA metrics into models that include clinical parameters should be tested further to support their diagnostic performance.\nUsing diverse statistical methods and metrics that incorporate both the intensity and percentage time during which CPP falls below various CPP targets, we highlight the clinical potential of the LLA. Conversely, deviations from CPPopt, as well as from the fixed CPP targets proposed by the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF), did not convey meaningful prognostic information in our analysis. While explorations assessing autoregulation informed CPP targets in paediatric TBI remain scarce, previous explorations in retrospective datasets with fewer patients have also described the association between CPP below autoregulation informed CPP targets and outcome.\nFrom a clinical perspective, it is important to note that the LLA is both patient specific and dynamically variable over time. The temporal profile of LLA demonstrated that individuals with favourable outcomes exhibited a relatively stable LLA (consistently around 55 mmHg). In contrast, patients with unfavourable outcomes demonstrated significant temporal variability in LLA: initially similar to the favourable group at approximately 55 mmHg on day 0, their LLA subsequently increased, reaching nearly 60 mmHg by day 5. This pattern highlights an increased CPP requirement to maintain adequate cerebral blood flow and suggests the clinical importance of closely monitoring the dynamic behaviour of LLA, especially in patients at risk of unfavourable outcomes.\nCurrent guidelines suggest fixed targets between 40 and 50 mmHg, emphasising that younger patients likely require lower CPP targets compared to adolescents.\nOur analyses are limited to a relatively small sample size (n = 135) with insufficient numbers for age-stratified analyses. Yet, LLA remained a promising target even after correction for the known prognostic parameters. As most research on PRx derived targets has been performed in adult TBI cohorts, the parameters used for estimation of CPPopt and LLA are derived from the adult cohort, adjusted for the paediatric physiology. Whether these represent the optimal parameters remains to be explored. A notable consideration of this analysis is the use of a PRx threshold of 0.2 for LLA calculation. The primary STARSHIP analysis suggested that a PRx threshold of 0 was best for predicting outcome, but mortality-based assessments were not possible owing to low death numbers. When exploring a PRx threshold for LLA estimation, a threshold that reflects\nImportantly, as this study represents a secondary analysis of observational data, we did not have detailed information regarding specific therapies administered to modify CPP. Patient management across the participating centres generally adhered to BTF guidelines, encompassing both CPP and ICP control. Thus, our analysis primarily captures secondary deviations from these standard targets–deviations that were likely unavoidable even under optimal clinical care. Additionally, although CPP can often be augmented through therapeutic interventions, the personalised targets (CPPopt and LLA, both based on PRx application) remain independent of the immediate CPP value, as they reflect the underlying state of cerebral autoregulation. Despite carefully adjusting for various established prognostic covariates, our analysis remains observational and therefore identifies associations rather than causal relationships. Prospective interventional studies are needed to validate the clinical utility of LLA and to determine whether actively targeting LLA leads to improved outcomes or improved prognostication.\nAll authors had full access to all the data in the study and accept responsibility to submit for publication.

A year later, he had difficulty completing sentences, and 3 years after onset, was reduced to one‐word answers. He developed severe apathy and agitation, and became more impulsive. He eventually became mute and had difficulty with walking and balance. The patient had mild repetitive head injury while playing football and three concussions. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed left > right frontotemporal atrophy. Duration of illness was 6 years. Neuropathology revealed an unexpected number and diversity of degenerative pathologies, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE, high level), high level Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (A3B3C3), limbic Lewy body disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (type 2), argyrophilic grain disease (Stage 2), and neuronal intranuclear hyaline inclusion body disease. In addition, there was selective and asymmetric involvement of the corticospinal tract with globular oligodendroglial tau pathology corresponding to globular glial tauopathy (Type II). The patchy and irregular accentuation of cortical tau pathology, particularly in the depths of sulci and accumulation around blood vessels, allows the diagnosis of CTE‐neuropathologic change. This diagnosis correlated with the past medical history of multiple concussions. In addition, the patient had an unprecedented number and combination of additional degenerative pathologies, including those that are rare, and how they contributed to the clinical symptoms is difficult to interpret. Globular glial tauopathy Type II is a rare disorder that has been mostly reported in association with progressive supranuclear gaze palsy, and these observations support the notion that globular glial tauopathy Type II is an independent entity with isolated corticospinal tract involvement. These observations highlight that rare disorders can occur in the same individual and be overlooked, especially when there is more obvious pathology.

Globular glial tauopathies (GGT) were defined in a consensus study in 2013, and the three neuropathological subtypes (Types I–III) are characterized by tau‐immunopositive inclusions that are predominantly in oligodendroglia and/or astroglia in the frontal, temporal, and/or precentral cortices, with or without corticospinal tract involvement [\nFinally, eosinophilic and p62‐immunopositive intranuclear inclusions in neuronal and astrocytic nuclei were detected in the frontal cortex and medial temporal lobe, corresponding to NIHIBD [\nDespite the prevalence of concomitant pathologies in longitudinal aging and neurodegenerative studies, the number and combination of degenerative pathologies in the current case, including rare forms, are exceptional, and how they contributed to the diverse clinical symptoms is difficult to interpret. These observations highlight that even rare disorders can occur in the same individual and can be overlooked when there is a more obvious pathology, for example, CTE and AD‐neuropathologic change. Importantly, the number of combined pathologies could not be suspected in MRI, although the asymmetric frontotemporal atrophy was suggestive of a neurodegenerative process. We propose that mild repetitive head injury induces p‐tau pathology and can accelerate diverse neurodegenerative proteinopathy forms in the same brain. It remains unclear whether repetitive head impacts from a young age and an initial concussion at age 11 contributed to an unusually high number of co‐pathologies in this case compared to those reported in other neurodegenerative diseases [\nApproval of the research protocol: This study was approved by the UHN Research Ethics Board (Nr. 20‐5258) and University of Toronto (Nr. 39459) and was performed per the ethical standards established in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki, updated in 2008.\nBrain tissue was obtained at autopsy through appropriate consenting procedures with informed consent from the patient or their relatives and approval of the local Ethical Committee.\nGabor G.

This is characterized by neurites and neuronal pathological inclusions throughout the brainstem and amygdala, with an absence of Lewy bodies in neocortical areas. This corresponds to Stage 4 of Lewy related pathology according to Braak et al. [\nA further peculiar tau pathology was recognized in the left motor cortex and descending corticospinal tract. Here, we detected a very selective and asymmetric involvement of the corticospinal tract with oligodendroglial tau pathology corresponding to globular glial tauopathy Type II. Globular glial tauopathies (GGT) were defined in a consensus study in 2013, and the three neuropathological subtypes (Types I–III) are characterized by tau‐immunopositive inclusions that are predominantly in oligodendroglia and/or astroglia in the frontal, temporal, and/or precentral cortices, with or without corticospinal tract involvement [\nFinally, eosinophilic and p62‐immunopositive intranuclear inclusions in neuronal and astrocytic nuclei were detected in the frontal cortex and medial temporal lobe, corresponding to NIHIBD [\nDespite the prevalence of concomitant pathologies in longitudinal aging and neurodegenerative studies, the number and combination of degenerative pathologies in the current case, including rare forms, are exceptional, and how they contributed to the diverse clinical symptoms is difficult to interpret. These observations highlight that even rare disorders can occur in the same individual and can be overlooked when there is a more obvious pathology, for example, CTE and AD‐neuropathologic change. Importantly, the number of combined pathologies could not be suspected in MRI, although the asymmetric frontotemporal atrophy was suggestive of a neurodegenerative process. We propose that mild repetitive head injury induces p‐tau pathology and can accelerate diverse neurodegenerative proteinopathy forms in the same brain. It remains unclear whether repetitive head impacts from a young age and an initial concussion at age 11 contributed to an unusually high number of co‐pathologies in this case compared to those reported in other neurodegenerative diseases [\nApproval of the research protocol: This study was approved by the UHN Research Ethics Board (Nr. 20‐5258) and University of Toronto (Nr. 39459) and was performed per the ethical standards established in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki, updated in 2008.\nBrain tissue was obtained at autopsy through appropriate consenting procedures with informed consent from the patient or their relatives and approval of the local Ethical Committee.\nGabor G.

Initial laboratory evaluation revealed serum sodium of 140 mmol/L( Normal range: 135–145 mmol/l), potassium 3.5 mg/dL (Normal range: 3.5–5.5 mg/dl), carbon dioxide 25 mmol/L ( Normal range: 23–29 mmol/l), creatinine 1.14 mg/dL ( normal range: 0.6–1.2 mg/dl), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11 mg/dL ( normal range: 7–20 mg/dl), calcium 8.1 mg/dL( normal range: 8.5-10.2 mg/dl), total protein 7.4 g/dL ( normal range: 6–8.3 g/dl), albumin 4.1 g/dL (normal range: 3.5–5.0 g/dl), blood glucose 150 mg/dL, and plasma osmolality 301 mOsm/kg ( normal range: 270–295 mosm/kg). Urine osmolality ( normal range: 50-1200mosm/kg) was not assessed at admission. Urine output was recorded at 1.9 mL/kg/hr on the first day. To manage elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), mannitol 50 g of 20% solution was administered intravenously every six hours. On day 2, the patient was transferred from the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for continued neurocritical care monitoring and management.\nOn day 2, rising sodium levels (159 mmol/L) were associated with polyuria (urine output 4.5 mL/kg/hr) and hyperosmolality (serum osmolality: 323 mOsm/kg; urine osmolality: 436 mOsm/kg; urine-to-plasma osmolality ratio: 1.35). While mannitol likely contributed to polyuria, the presence of hypertonic urine in the setting of hypernatremia raised early suspicion for vasopressin deficiency, suggesting it may have been unmasked rather than caused by mannitol. Mannitol was discontinued, and isotonic saline was administered to replace urine output on a 1:1 basis. (Table\nBy day 3, polyuria persisted (urine output 5.1 mL/kg/hr), and sodium levels rose further to 165 mmol/L. Laboratory results indicated a urine osmolality of 222 mOsm/kg, serum osmolality of 334 mOsm/kg, and a urine-to-plasma osmolality ratio of 0.664, consistent with vasopressin deficiency. A vasopressin infusion was initiated at a dose of 0.35 milliunits/kg/hr × 73.7 kg, equating to 12.9 mL/hr, administered intravenously and continuously. Isotonic saline continued to replace urinary losses. Arginine vasopressin level measured at 3.4 pg/mL ruled out syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Enteral feeding was commenced with Jevity formula through a nasogastric tube, achieving full feeds.\nNotably, the patient had left adrenal hematoma. A normal morning cortisol level of 14 µg/dL and TSH of 2.66 mIU/mL suggested preserved adrenal reserve and a euthyroid state, supporting the diagnosis of vasopressin deficiency over panhypopituitarism.\nOn day 4, sodium levels decreased to 129 mmol/L, prompting cessation of vasopressin. The patient remained euvolemic with a decreasing urine output of 3.5 mL/kg/hr. Day 4 serum osmolality was 298 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality was 374 mOsm/kg. By day 5, sodium normalized to 138 mmol/L and urine output decreased to 2 mL/kg/hr. Serum osmolality on day 5 was 285 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality was 572 mOsm/kg. There is no mention of hyponatremia post-vasopressin cessation.\nThe fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA) was 10.14%, and the fractional excretion of urea (FEurea) was 55.4%, with a serum sodium of 138 mmol/L—findings suggestive of evolving SIADH and inconsistent with cerebral salt wasting.\nFluid replacement was stopped, and fluids were restricted to half-maintenance rate. Enteral feeding continued with Jevity 1.5 at the rate of 70 cc/hr, supplemented by free water (50 mL Q4h). Day 6 urine osmolality was 793 mOsm/kg. Day 6 sodium was 138 mmol/L, urine output was 1.8 mL/kg/hr, and serum osmolality was 297 mOsm/kg. By day 7, serum osmolality was 288 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality was 693 mOsm/kg.\nThroughout the hospital course, the patient’s sodium levels, and urine output remained stable within normal limits, suggesting adequate management of fluid and electrolyte status. Final laboratory values demonstrated a serum sodium of 140 mmol/L, potassium 3.5 mg/dL, carbon dioxide 30 mmol/L, creatinine 0.63 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 18 mg/dL, calcium 8.4 mg/dL, total protein 6.9 g/dL, and albumin 2.8 g/dL. Urine output stabilized at 1.1 mL/kg/hr, further supporting recovery of fluid homeostasis. The trend in these parameters indicated effective renal perfusion and resolution of acute derangements related to the initial brain injury and its management. (Table\n\nTimeline of sodium levels and interventions in Pediatric TBI\n\nGraph plotting serum sodium and urine output over time\n\nDaily trends in sodium balance, osmolality, and interventions during phases of sodium dysregulation Post-TBI\nIn the discussion of this case, it is essential to highlight the potential triphasic response in sodium regulation following traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly in the context of osmotic therapy. Phase 1, characterized by osmotic diuresis and unmasking of arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVD), has been primarily attributed to the administration of mannitol. However, attributing these changes solely to mannitol overlooks the complex neuroendocrine response to TBI. The injury itself may directly disrupt hypothalamic-pituitary regulation, leading to transient or persistent AVD. Phase 2 is defined by overt vasopressin deficiency, during which patients exhibit polyuria, hypernatremia, and rising serum osmolality—features consistent with Arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVD). Treatment during this phase typically involves fluid replacement and, in some cases, desmopressin to mitigate free water loss. In this case, however, the patient’s sodium levels remained within normal limits, and urine output gradually stabilized, suggesting either a mild form of AVD or effective endogenous compensation.\nPhase 3 involves a transition to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), often occurring as the hypothalamic-pituitary axis begins to recover. This rebound phenomenon results in water retention, dilutional hyponatremia, and low serum osmolality. Importantly, SIAD can recur even after initial resolution, complicating fluid management. The interplay between AVD and SIAD may overlap, particularly in the setting of TBI, and requires close monitoring. In this case, the patient’s final laboratory results showed normalized sodium and creatinine levels, stable urine output (1.1 mL/kg/hr), and no overt signs of SIAD, suggesting a favorable transition and resolution of neuroendocrine dysfunction. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing and anticipating the triphasic pattern of vasopressin dysregulation in TBI to guide appropriate management and improve outcomes.\nThe review by Tudor et al., examined posterior pituitary dysfunction following traumatic brain injury (TBI), focusing on the mechanisms and clinical outcomes and highlighted that TBI can lead to disorders such as arginine vasopressin deficiency and hyponatremia due to impaired secretion of arginine vasopressin [\nFollowing TBI, dysregulation of hypothalamic arginine-vasopressin (AVP) leads to significant water and electrolyte disturbances, and serum copeptin—a stable surrogate marker of AVP—has been shown to correlate with injury severity, loss of osmoregulation, and poorer neurological outcomes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker in TBI. Normal plasma AVP levels typically range from 1 to 13 pg/mL, though values can vary slightly depending on the assay and clinical context [\nThis case report is important because it exemplifies a rare but clinically significant sequence of sodium disturbances—osmotic diuresis, arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVD), and subsequent syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD)—following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These phases often overlap, mimic one another, or transition rapidly, making diagnosis and management highly challenging. The case emphasizes:\n\nIn sum, the case bridges a gap between theory and bedside care, offering both a cautionary tale and a practical guide for optimizing outcomes in critically ill TBI patients.\nPathophysiology of Sodium Imbalance in Traumatic Brain Injury:\nSodium imbalance in TBI results from disruptions in hypothalamic-pituitary regulation, intracranial pressure, and renal handling of water and electrolytes. (Tables\nIn patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), mannitol is frequently administered as an osmotic diuretic to manage elevated intracranial pressure. When used in isolation, without concurrent vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus), mannitol typically induces polyuria characterized by high urine osmolality and specific gravity, reflecting osmotic diuresis rather than a hormonal imbalance. Serum osmolality may be elevated due to water loss and the osmotic load of mannitol, and mild hypernatremia may occur if fluid losses are not adequately replaced. Importantly, urine remains relatively concentrated, and mannitol can be detected in the urine through specific testing. Unlike central diabetes insipidus, where urine is markedly dilute and responds robustly to desmopressin (DDAVP), mannitol-induced polyuria does not improve with DDAVP administration. Differentiating between these etiologies is crucial to guide appropriate management and prevent misdiagnosis in the acute neurocritical care setting.\n\nDiagnostic clues in sodium imbalance\n\nManagement approaches based on phase\nTo aid in timely diagnosis and targeted management of sodium disturbances in neurocritical care settings, a structured ICU protocol is essential. The following schematic outlines key diagnostic criteria, differentiation strategies, and condition-specific interventions for common sodium imbalance syndromes encountered after traumatic brain injury. ICU Protocol for Early Recognition and Differentiation of Sodium Imbalance Syndromes (Table\n\nICU protocol summary\n• Evaluate volume status via clinical exam, CVP, and bedside ultrasound\n• Laboratory: Serum Na⁺, urine Na⁺, serum and urine osmolality, urine output\n• Plasma copeptin (if available) to differentiate AVP deficiency\n• Rule out adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism\n\nDifferentiation of SIAD, CSW, and arginine vasopressin deficiency\n\nICU management strategies by diagnosis\n• Fluid restriction (500–1000 mL/day)\n• Hypertonic saline (3%) for symptomatic Na⁺ <120 mmol/L\n• Vasopressin receptor antagonists (e.g., tolvaptan)\n• Serum Na⁺ monitoring every 4–6 h\n• Isotonic or hypertonic saline\n• Fludrocortisone to promote Na⁺ retention\n• Strict fluid input/output monitoring\n• Daily electrolytes\n• Desmopressin (intranasal or IV)\n• Hypotonic fluids for free water replacement\n• Serum Na⁺ monitoring every 4–6 h\n\nAbrupt cessation of mannitol in patients with cerebral edema may lead to rebound intracranial hypertension and worsening neurological status. A gradual tapering approach with close intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is recommended.\n\nOvercorrection of sodium levels with vasopressin analogs in arginine vasopressin deficiency patients can precipitate water intoxication and hyponatremia.\nRisk of thromboembolic events and peripheral ischemia in critically ill patients should be considered before initiating vasopressin.\n\nRapid correction of hyponatremia (> 8–10 mEq/L per 24 h) can increase the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), necessitating gradual correction with frequent sodium monitoring.\nLong-term implications following traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly in pediatric patients, necessitate comprehensive multidisciplinary follow-up to detect evolving neuroendocrine, neurologic, and renal sequelae. Endocrinological assessments should include routine evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, especially in post-neurosurgical or TBI cases, alongside serial serum and urine osmolality monitoring to assess resolution or progression of sodium disturbances. Neurologically, patients with persistent polyuria or hyponatremia warrant brain MRI with a pituitary protocol, and pediatric patients should undergo longitudinal neurodevelopmental assessments to identify potential cognitive or behavioral impairments. Nephrological follow-up involves periodic evaluation of renal function and electrolyte balance, with particular attention to the risk of osteoporosis in those with chronic SIAD [\nThe limitations in management based on this case report include:\n\nThese limitations underscore the need for more accessible diagnostic tools, standardized protocols, and prospective studies focused on neuroendocrine complications in TBI, particularly in pediatric critical care settings.\nTBI followed by mannitol-induced diuresis, arginine vasopressin deficiency, and SIAD has been documented individually, but it is very rare to observe all these conditions occurring sequentially in the same patient.\n\nOsmotic diuresis: Discontinue offending agents and replace losses with isotonic saline.\nAVD: Vasopressin or desmopressin therapy with careful monitoring of sodium levels and urine output.\nSIAD: Fluid restriction and addressing underlying triggers.\nThis case highlights the critical importance of vigilant monitoring and individualized management of sodium disturbances following traumatic brain injury. The dynamic interplay between osmotic diuresis, arginine vasopressin deficiency, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) underscores the diagnostic complexity inherent in such cases. Early recognition of clinical signs, in conjunction with serum and urine osmolality measurements, is essential for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. Rapid transitions between phases necessitate careful monitoring to avoid complications from overcorrection or delayed treatment. Incorporating graphical representations of laboratory trends and fluid status may further aid clinicians in understanding and managing these evolving electrolyte derangements.\nThis case highlights the interplay between TBI, mannitol use, and arginine vasopressin deficiency, showing how effective early intervention and accurate diagnosis can optimize patient outcomes.", "content_for_embedding": "Sodium imbalance in TBI results from disruptions in hypothalamic-pituitary regulation, intracranial pressure, and renal handling of water and electrolytes [\nA 17-year-old African American male weighing 70 kg with a height of 175 cm., was admitted following a traumatic brain injury requiring emergent left hemicraniectomy and hematoma evacuation on hospital day 1.

These findings highlight the importance of recognizing and anticipating the triphasic pattern of vasopressin dysregulation in TBI to guide appropriate management and improve outcomes.\nThe review by Tudor et al., examined posterior pituitary dysfunction following traumatic brain injury (TBI), focusing on the mechanisms and clinical outcomes and highlighted that TBI can lead to disorders such as arginine vasopressin deficiency and hyponatremia due to impaired secretion of arginine vasopressin [\nFollowing TBI, dysregulation of hypothalamic arginine-vasopressin (AVP) leads to significant water and electrolyte disturbances, and serum copeptin—a stable surrogate marker of AVP—has been shown to correlate with injury severity, loss of osmoregulation, and poorer neurological outcomes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker in TBI. Normal plasma AVP levels typically range from 1 to 13 pg/mL, though values can vary slightly depending on the assay and clinical context [\nThis case report is important because it exemplifies a rare but clinically significant sequence of sodium disturbances—osmotic diuresis, arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVD), and subsequent syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD)—following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These phases often overlap, mimic one another, or transition rapidly, making diagnosis and management highly challenging. The case emphasizes:\n\nIn sum, the case bridges a gap between theory and bedside care, offering both a cautionary tale and a practical guide for optimizing outcomes in critically ill TBI patients.\nPathophysiology of Sodium Imbalance in Traumatic Brain Injury:\nSodium imbalance in TBI results from disruptions in hypothalamic-pituitary regulation, intracranial pressure, and renal handling of water and electrolytes. (Tables\nIn patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), mannitol is frequently administered as an osmotic diuretic to manage elevated intracranial pressure. When used in isolation, without concurrent vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus), mannitol typically induces polyuria characterized by high urine osmolality and specific gravity, reflecting osmotic diuresis rather than a hormonal imbalance. Serum osmolality may be elevated due to water loss and the osmotic load of mannitol, and mild hypernatremia may occur if fluid losses are not adequately replaced. Importantly, urine remains relatively concentrated, and mannitol can be detected in the urine through specific testing. Unlike central diabetes insipidus, where urine is markedly dilute and responds robustly to desmopressin (DDAVP), mannitol-induced polyuria does not improve with DDAVP administration. Differentiating between these etiologies is crucial to guide appropriate management and prevent misdiagnosis in the acute neurocritical care setting.\n\nDiagnostic clues in sodium imbalance\n\nManagement approaches based on phase\nTo aid in timely diagnosis and targeted management of sodium disturbances in neurocritical care settings, a structured ICU protocol is essential. The following schematic outlines key diagnostic criteria, differentiation strategies, and condition-specific interventions for common sodium imbalance syndromes encountered after traumatic brain injury. ICU Protocol for Early Recognition and Differentiation of Sodium Imbalance Syndromes (Table\n\nICU protocol summary\n• Evaluate volume status via clinical exam, CVP, and bedside ultrasound\n• Laboratory: Serum Na⁺, urine Na⁺, serum and urine osmolality, urine output\n• Plasma copeptin (if available) to differentiate AVP deficiency\n• Rule out adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism\n\nDifferentiation of SIAD, CSW, and arginine vasopressin deficiency\n\nICU management strategies by diagnosis\n• Fluid restriction (500–1000 mL/day)\n• Hypertonic saline (3%) for symptomatic Na⁺ <120 mmol/L\n• Vasopressin receptor antagonists (e.g., tolvaptan)\n• Serum Na⁺ monitoring every 4–6 h\n• Isotonic or hypertonic saline\n• Fludrocortisone to promote Na⁺ retention\n• Strict fluid input/output monitoring\n• Daily electrolytes\n• Desmopressin (intranasal or IV)\n• Hypotonic fluids for free water replacement\n• Serum Na⁺ monitoring every 4–6 h\n\nAbrupt cessation of mannitol in patients with cerebral edema may lead to rebound intracranial hypertension and worsening neurological status. A gradual tapering approach with close intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is recommended.\n\nOvercorrection of sodium levels with vasopressin analogs in arginine vasopressin deficiency patients can precipitate water intoxication and hyponatremia.\nRisk of thromboembolic events and peripheral ischemia in critically ill patients should be considered before initiating vasopressin.\n\nRapid correction of hyponatremia (> 8–10 mEq/L per 24 h) can increase the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), necessitating gradual correction with frequent sodium monitoring.\nLong-term implications following traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly in pediatric patients, necessitate comprehensive multidisciplinary follow-up to detect evolving neuroendocrine, neurologic, and renal sequelae. Endocrinological assessments should include routine evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, especially in post-neurosurgical or TBI cases, alongside serial serum and urine osmolality monitoring to assess resolution or progression of sodium disturbances. Neurologically, patients with persistent polyuria or hyponatremia warrant brain MRI with a pituitary protocol, and pediatric patients should undergo longitudinal neurodevelopmental assessments to identify potential cognitive or behavioral impairments. Nephrological follow-up involves periodic evaluation of renal function and electrolyte balance, with particular attention to the risk of osteoporosis in those with chronic SIAD [\nThe limitations in management based on this case report include:\n\nThese limitations underscore the need for more accessible diagnostic tools, standardized protocols, and prospective studies focused on neuroendocrine complications in TBI, particularly in pediatric critical care settings.\nTBI followed by mannitol-induced diuresis, arginine vasopressin deficiency, and SIAD has been documented individually, but it is very rare to observe all these conditions occurring sequentially in the same patient.\n\nOsmotic diuresis: Discontinue offending agents and replace losses with isotonic saline.\nAVD: Vasopressin or desmopressin therapy with careful monitoring of sodium levels and urine output.\nSIAD: Fluid restriction and addressing underlying triggers.\nThis case highlights the critical importance of vigilant monitoring and individualized management of sodium disturbances following traumatic brain injury. The dynamic interplay between osmotic diuresis, arginine vasopressin deficiency, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) underscores the diagnostic complexity inherent in such cases. Early recognition of clinical signs, in conjunction with serum and urine osmolality measurements, is essential for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. Rapid transitions between phases necessitate careful monitoring to avoid complications from overcorrection or delayed treatment. Incorporating graphical representations of laboratory trends and fluid status may further aid clinicians in understanding and managing these evolving electrolyte derangements.\nThis case highlights the interplay between TBI, mannitol use, and arginine vasopressin deficiency, showing how effective early intervention and accurate diagnosis can optimize patient outcomes.", "topic": "TBI"}

Few studies have shown that e-scooter and bicycle accidents differ in terms of user-profiles and injury characteristics. Still, there is missing information comparing the specific injury types, the overall incidence, and the relative risk of these accidents. We aimed to compare the characteristics, severity, and rate of e-scooter and bicycle injuries and assess their relative risk. We conducted a retrospective register study comparing e-scooter and bicycle injuries treated in emergency departments in Helsinki between 1.1.2022 and 31.12.2023. Data was collected from the Helsinki University Hospital electronic data pool. We evaluated injury severity using the Abbreviated Injury Score. The incidence and relative risk for e-scooter accidents was assessed based on the usage data of all shared e-scooters, and the estimation of bicycle trips was made utilizing several travel surveys. There were 677 e-scooter accidents and 1889 bicycle accidents during the study period. E-scooter riders were younger, with a mean age of 33 (SD 13), compared to cyclists with a mean age of 47 (SD 17). The incidence of e-scooter accidents leading to ED care was 7.8 per 100,000 trips, whereas the estimated incidence of bicycle accidents was 2.2 per 100,000 trips. The relative risk for e-scooter accidents leading to ED care was 3.6 (CI 3.3–3.9), compared to bicycle accidents, E-scooter riders were more likely to ride intoxicated (incidence 29% vs. 8%) and less likely to wear a helmet (4% vs. 28%) compared with cyclists. Head injuries occurred more often with e-scooter riders (46% vs. 31%) compared to cyclists, whereas torso injuries were more common among cyclists (11% vs. 5%) than e-scooter riders. A higher proportion of e-scooter accidents happened during the nighttime, between 10 PM and 8 AM, compared to cyclists (40% vs. 31%). Intoxicated riding was also more common among e-scooter riders during the nighttime (50% vs. 22%). E-scooter and bicycle accidents differ in terms of patient characteristics and injury types. The high incidence of head injuries and intoxicated riders among e-scooter riders suggests that preventive measures on e-scooters are warranted.

The data was collected from an electronic database of the three public EDs that manage all adult trauma patients (≥ 16 years of age) in Helsinki—one level I trauma center and two level IV trauma centers. The other level IV trauma center was merged with the level I trauma center during our study on 1.2.2023. Level IV trauma centers take care of patients injured in the Helsinki region with mild or moderate trauma, while surgical patients and severe injuries are treated in the level I trauma center. In addition to that, all high-level trauma patients injured in southern Finland are treated in this level I trauma center. The study was conducted in accordance with the Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.\nIn Finland, shared e-scooters are available via mobile app. Shared e-scooters are technically available only for 18-year-olds and older, but there is no monitoring system for this age limit. The top speed is limited to 20 km/h for shared e-scooters and 25 km/h for private e-scooters. Since the year 2021, from Sunday to Thursday nights between 12 AM to 5 AM, the top speed of shared e-scooters is limited to 15 km/h, and rental is banned on Friday and Saturday nights between 12 AM and 5 AM. Using e-scooters under the influence of alcohol is forbidden by the legislation. Private e-scooters are also legal. However, they represent a minority compared to rental e-scooters in Helsinki. In 2022, there were 6 shared e-scooter operators, with an average combined fleet size of 15,612 e-scooters during the summer months from May to August. In comparison, in 2023, there were 5 operators with an average combined fleet size of 12,340 e-scooters during the same period.\nThere is no standard speed limit for cycling, but on the roadway, cyclists must adhere to the same speed limits as all other vehicles. The speed limit for electric assistance on electronic bikes is 25 km/h. In cycling, there is no blood alcohol limit, but cyclists can be held liable for compensation if causing harm to others while driving intoxicated. From April to October, shared bicycles are also available. Helmet use for both cycling and riding an e-scooter is highly recommended but not mandatory.\nPseudonymized data of all patients over 16 years old with a bicycle injury or an e-scooter injury taken care of in one of the three emergency departments during 2022 and 2023 were collected retrospectively. A word search with four bicycle and e-scooter-related words was used to select the patients from the Helsinki University Hospital data pool, which includes electronic medical records from all ED visits. After the initial word search, all non-bicycle or non-e-scooter-related injuries were excluded manually by a single author.\nThe collected variables included the age and gender of the injured person, the time and mechanism of the injury, rider intoxication, helmet usage, and whether the e-scooter was private or commercial. The time of injury was set as accurately as possible based on the patient’s history. If accurate injury time was unavailable, we used the time of the emergency call or the admittance time to the ED.

The retrospective nature of this study also causes some limitations. We had to rely on documentation from ED personnel for case details, and since there were no distinct protocols for reporting, e-scooter ownership, helmet usage, and alcohol intoxication may have been inadequately reported. Furthermore, we did not have specific details regarding the accidents leading to the injury. We did not have data on patients treated only in private hospitals, and therefore, the relative incidences might have been slightly underestimated. However, we excluded injuries in patients using private e-scooters and those injured outside Helsinki to get the most accurate injury incidence estimate. Finally, we had to rely on an estimation based on travel survey data of bicycle usage when evaluating the relative risk between e-scooters and bicycles. However, this limitation applies to all major cities worldwide. In addition, the survey data we used was impartial and of high standard.\nOur study shows that patients injured while riding e-scooters differed from patients injured while cycling in terms of being younger, having lower helmet usage, and having a higher intoxication rate, especially during nighttime.

However, we excluded injuries in patients using private e-scooters and those injured outside Helsinki to get the most accurate injury incidence estimate. Finally, we had to rely on an estimation based on travel survey data of bicycle usage when evaluating the relative risk between e-scooters and bicycles. However, this limitation applies to all major cities worldwide. In addition, the survey data we used was impartial and of high standard.\nOur study shows that patients injured while riding e-scooters differed from patients injured while cycling in terms of being younger, having lower helmet usage, and having a higher intoxication rate, especially during nighttime. E-scooter riders were more likely to sustain head injuries than cyclists, whereas the proportion of torso and upper extremity injuries was more common among cyclists. We estimate that e-scooter riding poses approximately 3.6 times higher risk for accidents than cycling.\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n\nSupplementary Material 1.", "topic": "TBI"}

Several computational techniques exist that could reduce the need for all reports to be manually classified.\nThree computational approaches were tested for performance and calibration; a large language model using prompts designed for this project, Digitalizing English-language CT Interpretation for Positive Haemorrhage Evaluation Reporting large language model (DECIPHER-LLM), had the best performance and calibration.\nUsing DECIPHER-LLM could reduce the requirement to manually classify CT reports by 86% while maintaining 100% sensitivity for intracranial haemorrhage.\nHead CT is a commonly used diagnostic imaging modality in the emergency department (ED). CT imaging for head injury is a critical part of emergency assessment, and the absence of an intracranial bleed (ICB) on CT is a major determinant of discharge disposition. However, appropriate CT ordering is important from many perspectives, including patient risk (eg, radiation), ED flow and health system costs, and so patient selection for CT is the subject of extensive research.\nBest practice for clinical documentation is that clinicians should add an appropriately structured coded diagnosis (eg, in Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms [SNOMED-CT]) at initial documentation; however, this commonly does not occur. Therefore, researchers studying predictors of ICB on CT must read individual text radiology reports to classify them for the presence or absence of ICB. Unlike structured variables (eg, age, sex) that can be quickly imported from electronic health records and digitally coded, CT reports can be lengthy, unstructured and nuanced.\nThe aim of this study, Digitalizing English-language CT Interpretation for Positive Haemorrhage Evaluation Reporting (DECIPHER), was to evaluate digitalisation tools to reduce researcher workload required for manual CT report review. The primary objective was to determine which of three digitalisation methods (the index tests) most accurately classified CT reports for the presence or absence of ICB.\nThis is a retrospective diagnostic test accuracy study. The study methodology and reporting follow the recommendations of Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD).\nWe assessed the performance of three methods of CT report digitalisation: an investigator-programmed text classification (TC) programme (in R: a language and environment for statistical computing R Foundation for statistical computing, Vienna, Austria), a commercially available clinical NLP approach (CLiX, Clinithink, Alpharetta, Georgia,\nThis is a subgroup analysis of an ongoing study based in the UK. Institutional ethics approval was obtained from the Health Research Authority and Health and Care Wales (research ethics committee reference 24/LO/0103).\nPatients presenting to any of the three EDs of Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK, between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2022 with a coded chief complaint of head injury (SNOMED-CT 170720001) and who had a CT scan of the head performed were eligible. Age, sex, the narrative CT report and other clinical and electronic data were extracted from the electronic patient record system. A random sample of 900 cases was selected from the overall study population to serve as the data source for this study.\nICB was defined as present (ICB+) if there was bleeding in any intracranial space (extradural, subdural, subarachnoid, intraventricular or intraparenchymal, including contusion). Head CTs were classified as ICB− if there were no haemorrhages or if there was bleeding limited to extracranial anatomical regions (eg, subgaleal, facial).\nThe reference standard classification for each CT report was determined by manual classification by research physicians. Two physicians reviewed the reports (SL and SHT). For 10% of CT reports, a second researcher (BB), blinded to the results of the initial review, provided an additional evaluation. Any classification uncertainties by the initial two researchers were adjudicated by a senior author (BB). All adjudicators of the reference standard were blinded to the results of the three digitisation methods.\nManual ICB classifications were entered into a spreadsheet (Excel, Office365, microsoft.com). Results from the tested digitalisation methods were added into the spreadsheet before importing data into analysis software (Stata 18.5MP, Stata Corp, stata.com).\nThree digitalisation methods were assessed in this project. The first was a text classifier (TC) developed in R. This was created using regular expressions to extract relevant vocabulary, Doc2Vec to vectorise the expressions, and a random forest model as a classifier for whether each sentence with relevant vocabulary affirmed or rejected ICB+. The second was a proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) information extraction (Clinithink,\nAI, artificial intelligence; DECIPHER, Digitalizing English-language CT Interpretation for Positive Haemorrhage Evaluation Reporting; GPT, generative pretrained transformer; LLM, large language model.\nThe TC and Clinithink methods allowed only for dichotomous categorisation (ICB+ or ICB−). Developing the TC approach required a derivation set, which was constituted by randomly selecting half of the overall dataset. The decision to split the data into two equal sets for derivation and validation was made a priori and planned based on predicted processes in which regular expressions were refined (\nClinithink does not require a training set for development. Clinithink provides explainability of where in the document and which postcoordinated SNOMED-CT terms were used to classify a document as ICB+/ICB−.\nFor both the TC and Clinithink, the reporting of results in terms of probability of ICB, or P(ICB), assumed values of either 0 or 1. The main evaluation of the commercial method was executed on the same 449 cases used for R validation.\nTo develop DECIPHER-LLM, a total of 50 samples from the 898 were used in prompt engineering and optimisation via the GPT-4o-mini Application Programming Interface (API). 50 samples were selected to ensure a diversity of cases for the prompt engineering process while avoiding potential overfitting. DECIPHER-LLM was designed to report a probability of ICH, rather than dichotomous output, as well as to offer reasoning as to why the algorithm applied that probability. We used Liu and Youden methods to select a probability threshold above which a CT was interpreted as having ICB+.\nIn a secondary analysis, we combined DECIPHER-LLM with manual review in a ‘hybrid’ model. For this analysis, we selected a probability threshold that maintained a sensitivity of 100% as our cut-off. We then calculated sensitivity, specificity and number needed to evaluate for this cut-off.\nThe main comparisons between the three digitalisation methods used the same 449-record test set. Since no derivation set was required for Clinithink or DECIPHER-LLM, the derivation dataset (also of n=449) that had been used to develop the TC was used as a supplemental (internal) evaluation dataset for the remaining two methods. This served as a planned sensitivity analysis to ascertain whether the performance of the Clinithink and DECIPHER-LLM classification methods substantively changed when applied to a different dataset.\nStata was used for all analysis and plotting. Significance was defined at the p<0.05 level, and CIs were calculated at the 95% level. Non-overlap of CIs was interpreted as suggesting statistical significance at the p<0.05 level.\nTrue and false positives (TP and FP) and true and false negatives (TN and FN) were assessed. We calculated standard performance measures: sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) and likelihood ratios associated with positive (LR+) and negative (LR−) classification. Classification performance was assessed using the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and the\nBecause from both clinical and research perspectives, minimising false negatives is critical, we prioritised sensitivity. A cut-point was set for the DECIPHER-LLM, at varying levels of LLM-calculated probability of positive testing P(ICB). The concept of the cut-point was based on the fact that DECIPHER-LLM could be set to report not just a ‘yes or no’ for predicting ICB but also a P(ICB) between 0% and 100%. The cut-point could be set at varying levels of P(ICB), to identify the lowest cut-point for P(ICB) that maintained a sensitivity of 100%. We therefore identified the maximum DECIPHER-LLM P(ICB) that retained 100% sensitivity and then obtained the count of CT reports that could be eliminated from the manual review requirement. The proportion of these reports (ie, those reliably classifiable as ICB−) was calculated and reported with a 95% CI.\nThe study set initially comprised 900 consecutive patients’ head CTs. Two of these reports were blank, leaving an overall study set of 898 head CTs for this analysis. Details on the 898 cases are shown in\nMany patients had multiple sites of bleeding.\nDiagnostic test characteristics are reported in\nDue to 0 cell value, negative likelihood ratio was calculated using the substitution method. For the DECIPHER-LLM, generation of comparative diagnostic classification first required determination of the optimal performing cut-point. While the most common LLM-calculated P(ICB) values were 0 (n=381, 84.86% of 449) and 1 (n=22, 4.9% of 449), intermediate P(ICB) values were reported in 46 cases (10.24% of 449).\nAUROC, area under receiver operator characteristic curve; F\nAt the optimal cut-point (0.1), DECIPHER-LLM’s sensitivity was 100% for determining the potential proportion of CT reports that could be comfortably categorised as ICB− (without further human manual review). Increasing the cut-point to 0.2 resulted in one FN, and increasing the cut-point to 0.3 resulted in two FNs; when the cut-point increased to 1.0, there were 36 FNs (\nOf note, false-negative errors were often attributable to chronic intracranial haemorrhages (eg, chronic subdural haematomas). False-positive errors were more common and sometimes attributable to the scan indication being included in the parsed text; for example, the request reason \"?intracranial haematoma\" was misinterpreted as the presence of ICB (\nIn this study, we identified potentially useful computer-based digitalisation methods to classify free-text CT reports for the presence of ICB. The investigator-programmed TC in R and Clinithink both performed well, but the best performance was achieved using an LLM technique. At its optimal cut-point, DECIPHER-LLM identified 100% of CT reports with ICB+ diagnosis with reasonable specificity (97.4%). Applying DECIPHER-LLM to a large dataset could markedly (by over 85%) reduce the need for manual CT report review for ICB classification, thus facilitating high precision in future large-scale studies with a dichotomous endpoint (ICB+/ICB−).\nUsing an NER NLP model (BrainNERD), investigators at Yale University reported a precision of 98.82%.\nIn ED research and clinical care protocol development, the emphasis tends to be ‘ICB+or not’. Site, laterality and size of ICB tend to be of secondary importance. Restriction of endpoint assessment to a binary ICB classification was this study’s primary strength; in the ED research situation, simplicity improves both classification performance and practical application.\nThe current study findings indicate that a human/AI hybrid model may save substantial time at minimal-to-zero cost in accuracy. Others have reported the use of a hybrid system for AI-assisted interpretation of clinical images.\nOur study has strengths and limitations. In some cases (eg, limitation to a dichotomous endpoint), a study strength was simultaneously a limitation. Other study strengths and weaknesses warrant specific mention.\nHead CT reports comprising our study set were real reports, from real clinical cases. This utilisation approach brought issues that could be expected when attempting to translate multiparagraph interpretations (of varying nuance and prolixity) into a ‘yes or no’. Some grey-area reporting was easily handled: language such as ‘highly likely’ was coded as ICB+ because that is how such reports would be treated in the ED setting. Challenges such as ambiguous language or initial–final reports with contrasting findings were not correctable, given our study design of allowing only one pass at programming and classification. Future work on AI programming will need to account for these and related issues.\nThis study identified the binary outputs of ICB+/−, without an attempt to subclassify location, size or laterality. One reason anatomical locations were not further assessed was that haemorrhage often included more than one classification. Cerebral contusion, for instance, occurred 34 times but occurred as an isolated finding in only eight cases (23.5% of 898); in the other three-fourths of cerebral contusion cases, there were additional haemorrhage types (eg, subdural, epidural).\nAlthough the results showed that DECIPHER-LLM performed better than TC or Clinithink, all three methods worked reasonably well. There is no basis to conclude that the performance levels we identified for TC or Clinithink represent those approaches’ ceilings. Either model could, with sufficient programming, be further tuned and could also report probabilities (rather than yes/no classification). Although the time taken to develop the three techniques was not measured, anecdotally, the time resources for the TC and Clinithink exceeded that required to develop the LLM, indicating that utilisation or development of the LLM might be more favourable. Restriction of the TC and Clinithink methods reporting to a 1/0 output probably increased the chances of better performance by the DECIPHER-LLM, which could report a range of probabilities from 0 to 1.\nThese tools were developed and assessed with the purpose of utilisation for the classification of text for research purposes. Any potential inaccuracy is therefore important because any misclassifications could propagate and lead to erroneous findings. Because research findings are used to inform clinical algorithms, we defined this classification work to identify text suitable for manual assessment, rather than defining the tool classification as the final step prior to use as research data. Furthermore, this is a single-centre study, and future work should focus on validation using other centres’ data.\nAs outlined in the results, the DECIPHER-LLM performed best at an intermediate cut-point—not the 0 or 1 dichotomisation. One study limitation is that the cut-point we identified as optimal, while confirmed with internal assessment on the R derivation dataset, may be different in other settings (and after further improvements to the LLM programming). Further exploration of AI models should include mechanisms to assess ideal cut-points. In addressing a related study limitation, further assessments of digitalisation applications should examine performance through the appropriate clinical lens that situationally weighs sensitivity and specificity.\nIn our study, for the purposes of resource conservation in clinical research using head CT reports, a GPT LLM-based approach performed better than a TC or a commercial product, and it could allow confident discarding from the need for manual review of the majority of CT reports without risking loss of sensitivity.\nFuture work should include the evolution of the LLM approach based on lessons learnt in this study. Follow-up evaluation of DECIPHER-LLM should include external validation, confirmation of consistency of the optimal probability cut-point and evaluation of LLM performance at different weightings of sensitivity and specificity.", "content_for_embedding": "Performing research using data contained in radiology free-text reports often requires manual classification of reports.

For the trial to be considered feasible, we have set a lower confidence limit (using\nInclusion: Based on an expected screening of approximately 200 eligible patients during the first 2 years of the trial, we aim to enrol a minimum of 80.

Also, the protocol targets SDs both by pursuing optimal physiological variables before randomising to and administering trial medication, aiming to ensure that trial medication is given to SDs that persist at optimal physiological conditions. Furthermore, trial medication is not given to sporadic SDs as these might not be harmful.\nAs limitations, the primary outcome, the prevalence of SDs, is a surrogate outcome measure for the effect on neurological improvement. However, the strong association of SDs with poor outcome is supported by studies across several categories of severe acute brain injury.\nIn conclusion, the KETA-BID trial investigates an intervention that targets an important pathophysiological mediator following severe acute brain injury (ie, SDs). Therefore, the intervention potentially both benefits the patient directly and can guide future clinical guidelines for prevention of secondary brain injury, which could improve outcome for neurocritically ill patients. S-ketamine is a novel treatment concept for secondary brain injury, which may inhibit SDs, a potentially major determinant of the clinical outcome for these patients. The drug has been used by anaesthesiologists for many years, and although it has not previously been used systematically for patients with severe acute brain injury, and the assessment of potential harms remains important, the risks associated with the trial appear to be minimal.

Although previous studies have emphasized the importance of monitoring coagulation biomarkers (INR, PT, and aPTT), the optimal timing for therapeutic intervention remains unclear\nThis study, using advanced statistical models, shows that coagulation markers provide the highest predictive accuracy for in-hospital mortality in TBI patients within the first three days. Specialists are advised to use these markers for early coagulation assessment to guide targeted therapeutic interventions and improve patient prognosis\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) presents a significant global health challenge due to the complex interplay of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Coagulopathy, as a common complication in patients with traumatic brain injury, is an imbalance between hemostatic and fibrinolytic processes and can lead to increased bleeding, intravascular thrombosis, or abnormal coagulation tests (\nThe reported prevalence of coagulopathy in isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) varies widely in the literature. Coagulopathy in isolated TBI occurred in 13%- 54% of patients (\nPrognosis of coagulopathy is typically determined using traditional coagulation tests such as Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalized Ratio (INR),activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT), and Platelet Count (PLT).\nPT measures the time, in seconds, for plasma to clot after adding thromboplastin to a patient's plasma sample. PT reference ranges can vary across different laboratories depending on the reagents and instruments used. However, in most laboratories, the normal range for PT is 10 to 13 seconds. Therefore, to standardize the reporting of PT results, the World Health Organization introduced the INR as a standard format (\nThe INR is commonly used as a surrogate for the PT value, providing a standardized way of reporting PT results. A normal INR value is 1.0, while for patients on anticoagulant therapy, it typically ranges between 2.0 and 3.0. INR levels above 4.9 indicate that the blood is clotting more slowly than desired, which is a critical situation (\nThe aPTT test measures the time it takes for a patient's blood to clot in seconds, and it is commonly used in clinical practice to monitor a patient's response to anticoagulation therapy, such as heparin. A normal aPTT range is typically between 25 and 35 seconds (\nPLT are circulating nuclear fragments derived from bone marrow megakaryocytes, and their count is typically between 250,000 and 260,000 cells/mm3. Platelets play a crucial role in the coagulation cascade by adhering to the site of injury to form a platelet plug, which helps to initiate the coagulation process and stop bleeding (\nThe role of acute coagulopathy as a significant risk factor for poor outcomes after traumatic brain injury has indeed been gaining increasing recognition and attention from the medical community in recent years. This has led to increased efforts to better understand the pathophysiology of coagulopathy in TBI patients and to develop strategies for early detection and management to improve patient outcomes (\nCoagulopathy has been strongly correlated with progressive hemorrhagic injury in TBI patients, which can adversely affect clinical outcomes (\nConventionally, coagulopathy biomarkers in medical research are measured only at the time of admission, and ROC curves evaluate the ability of these biomarkers to distinguish between patients who experience in-hospital mortality and those who survive, utilizing a binary outcome based on a single baseline biomarker measurement (\nIt is essential to acknowledge that in-hospital mortality among TBI patients cannot be accurately predicted solely by coagulopathy biomarkers, as multiple factors contribute to patient outcomes. Considering the multifactorial nature of TBI patient mortality, predicting patient outcomes based on coagulopathy biomarkers should involve adjusting for confounding variables and other relevant factors. Measurement errors can potentially reduce the predictive power of the coagulopathy biomarkers, leading to biased parameter estimates and impacting the perceived diagnostic effectiveness of these markers (\nWhile previous studies on TBI prognosis have recognized the importance of blood coagulation factors, they have not thoroughly investigated their time-dependent nature or their predictive value for clinical endpoints. This study applied a joint modeling framework within the ROC curve to address these gaps, evaluating the time-dependent efficacy of longitudinal coagulation factors (PT, INR, aPTT, and PLT) in predicting time-to-in-hospital mortality. By doing so, this research aims to provide valuable insights for clinical decision-making and identify critical time periods during which coagulation biomarkers should be monitored to achieve maximum discriminatory value.\nThis study was a retrospective cohort of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). All available patient files at Shohada-E-Tajrish Hospital in Tehran from 2018 to 2020 were selected using a convenience sampling method. According to Stevens (2001), a sample size of 10 to 15 observations per independent variable is considered sufficient. In this study, the joint model includes a maximum of eight independent variables. Assuming 15 observations per variable, the total required sample size is 120 (\nThe present study was performed in accordance with the relevant ethical guidelines. To ensure the protection of the participant's privacy and confidentiality. All personal information obtained from the study participants was recorded anonymously and handled with the utmost care and discretion to safeguard their privacy.\nDemographic variables and underlying conditions (as covariates or predictor variables in the joint model), including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood type, trauma mechanism, and medical history (myocardial infarction [MI], hypertension, diabetes, and smoking) were collected from patients' records.\nCT scan variables (as covariates or predictor variables in the joint model) assessed upon admission included tachycardia, as well as the presence of subdural hematoma (SDH), intracranial hemorrhage, epidural hematoma (EDH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was recorded every six hours throughout the patients' hospitalization, facilitating a longitudinal assessment of neurological status (for assessing inclusion criteria).\nCoagulation biomarkers, such as INR, PT, and aPTT, were measured every 24 hours (as a dependent variable in the joint model).\nIf there was missing data due to a delay in blood testing, the nearest available data (±1 hour) was used as a replacement; however, if no suitable data was available, the time point was removed for the specific patient.\nPatient outcome (survival/discharge or death) was documented following a 10-day follow-up period or upon hospital discharge, whichever occurred first (as a dependent variable in the joint model). This data collection method allowed researchers to investigate the temporal relationship between coagulation factors and clinical outcomes for the patients.\nDemographic and underlying conditions data and CT-scan results were reported separately for the non-survival (in-hospital death) and survival (discharge) groups. The association between these variables and outcome was assessed using logistic regression analysis, with results reported as odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.\nThe total follow-up period (240 hours) was divided into 10 intervals: 0-24, 0-48, 0-72, ..., 0-240. In each period, a joint model of longitudinal and survival data was applied to each coagulation test (aPTT, PT, and INR, overally 30 joint models). The joint model (formula-1) consists of two sub-models: longitudinal and survival. In the survival sub-model, the dependent variable was the time of death or discharge for each patient. The longitudinal sub-model included repeated measurements of aPTT, PT, or INR values as dependent variables (\n\nWhere\nJoint modeling accounts for the underlying association between longitudinal coagulation biomarkers (measured with error) and death, thereby yielding more precise inferences (\nThe joint longitudinal and survival model was initially fitted using a univariate approach (one predictor variable is defined in the model). Independent variables with a P-value <0.2 in the univariate model were considered for inclusion in the multiple model (some predictor variables are defined in the model), and the best-fitting model was selected based on the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value.\nSubsequently, a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the time-dependent effectiveness of longitudinal coagulation biomarkers in predicting patient clinical outcomes using the joint modeling results. The model enabled the identification of the optimal time interval for biomarker monitoring to achieve the highest discriminatory value (\nA total of 132 patients were included in the study, of which 112 (84.2%) were male. The patients were aged 14-97 years, with a median of 47 and a mean of 48.61 (SD=22.77). The maximum follow-up time was 363 hours, with the median and mean values of 87 and 106.37, respectively. Death occurred for 78 (58.64%) patients. The mean GCS score on admission was 6.93 (SD=4.21).\nIndependent-sample t-tests were used to compare the mean coagulation values on admission between the survival and non-survival groups.\nThe results showed that the mean aPTT, PT, and INR were significantly higher in the non-survival group compared to the survival group (\nThe joint model analysis for aPTT found that male sex (\nThe joint model analysis for PT also revealed that blood transfusion (\nThe joint model showed an association between older age (\nThe positive γ values obtained from the fitted joint models over the first 10 days indicated that the risk of death was positively associated with increasing levels of all three coagulation factors.\nAccording to the random effect parameter of the joint model, aPTT on the first day and PT and INR on the second day exhibited the strongest association with the risk of mortality (\nThe Area Under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity values were determined for the coagulation biomarkers. Overall, aPTT can serve as a good prognostic biomarker throughout the entire follow-up period (AUC above 0.7). The highest AUC for aPTT was estimated within the first 48 hours, indicating that this period is optimal for predicting patient outcomes based on aPTT. Furthermore, the estimated AUC for the first 96 hours was above 0.8 with good sensitivity and specificity (>0.7), demonstrating that aPTT exhibited good discriminatory potential during the initial first four days of hospitalization.\nThe AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values for PT and INR within the first three days were above 0.7, suggesting that both PT and INR may serve as effective indicators of diagnostic outcomes up to the third day. Moreover, INR demonstrated better sensitivity and specificity than PT, particularly during the final days of the follow-up period (\nAUC values for three coagulation biomarkers during study time\nRoc curves for coagulation tests on each 240-hour\n- BMI: body mass index, MI: myocardial infarction, ICH: intracranial hemorrhage, SDH: subdural hematoma, EDH: epidural hematoma, SAH: subarachnoid hemor-rhage, * is significant on 0.05.\nThe development of coagulopathy is a widely acknowledged complication of TBI, and its impact on patient outcomes is multifaceted. Coagulopathy can contribute to a variety of adverse outcomes in TBI patients, including increased risk of hemorrhagic progression, prolonged hospital and ICU stays, and higher mortality rates. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of coagulopathy is therefore essential in improving patient management and outcomes in TBI (\nIndeed, the results of this study showed that the mean values of the coagulation biomarkers (aPTT, PT, and INR) at the time of hospital admission were significantly higher in patients with fatal outcomes compared to those who were discharged (with OR >1).\nFurther studies reinforce the significant impact of coagulopathy on the prognosis of TBI patients. Acute coagulopathy upon admission to the emergency room was identified as a powerful and independent predictor of hospital mortality. A meta-analysis by Epstein et al., which included 22 TBI studies, indicated that the mortality of patients with Acute Traumatic Coagulopathy (ATC) and TBI ranged between 17% and 86%. Also, higher rates of single and multiple organ failure and disability at discharge were reported among patients with ATC (\nThe majority of studies have primarily investigated the predictive power of coagulation biomarkers for TBI patient outcomes using cross-sectional data and the classical ROC curve approach. In Kim et al.'s study, the areas under the ROC curve for aPTT and lymphocyte counts were 0.64 and 0.58, respectively. This suggests that, when measured on admission, these markers were moderately predictive of poor outcomes in TBI patients (\nIn contrast to previous studies that focused on one measure of coagulation biomarkers at hospital admission, this study utilized the repeated measurements of coagulation biomarkers (aPTT, PT, and INR) during hospital admissions in TBI patients. We employed time-dependent ROC curve analysis in conjunction with a joint longitudinal and survival model to assess the predictive power of these biomarkers for patient outcomes in TBI cases. This advanced model provided more accurate metrics for the predictive power of coagulation biomarkers, as it accounted for the relationship between coagulation biomarkers and patient outcomes, as well as the temporal changes in coagulation values. Additionally, it adjusted for other independent variables, which helped reduce measurement errors (\nThe joint models of longitudinal and survival data revealed that coagulation biomarkers were significantly associated with the survival of TBI patients after adjusting for other independent variables, indicating their predictive power for patient outcomes. These findings are consistent with previous studies, which have identified coagulopathy as a significant risk factor for mortality and disability in TBI patients (\nThe AUC values of the first three days were 0.93, 0.92, and 0.86 for aPTT, 0.86, 0.85, and 0.80 for PT; and 0.85, 0.85, and 0.79 for INR, suggesting that these coagulation biomarkers exhibited high predictive power for outcome in TBI patients during the first three days following hospital admission and that aPTT was the strongest predictor of patient outcomes, followed by PT and INR.\nA limited number of studies have assessed longitudinal coagulation biomarkers. Nakae et al.'s study supports the importance of evaluating temporal changes in coagulation and fibrinolytic markers for accurate prediction of outcomes in TBI patients (\nAlthough the three aforementioned studies differ from the present study in terms of methodology and analysis, they yield consistent results regarding the significance of coagulation biomarkers changes over time as an essential variable for predicting disease outcome, particularly in the early stages. All the studies emphasize the importance of focusing on the initial days following admission and highlight the need for close monitoring of coagulation markers during this critical period. Indeed, previous studies have underestimated the predictive value of coagulopathy for poor outcomes in TBI patients, which aligns with the findings of this current study. However, it is noteworthy that the AUC values for aPTT in this study (0.93) were higher than those reported in previous studies (0.64 and 0.75) (\nIt is proposed that the predictive power of viscoelastic tests, such as Thromboelastography (TEG) or Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), D-dimer, and other important biomarkers to patient outcomes be evaluated using the time-dependent ROC curve coupled joint model for longitudinal and survival data.\nRetrospective studies, particularly those that rely on patients’ files, can be subject to several biases. Information bias, including incomplete or missing data, illegible handwriting, and inconsistent documentation, could occur. In this study, to address these issues, the research team coordinated the information recorded by nurses and doctors in order to obtain a more accurate representation of the patient's conditions. However, some data was still missing or not recorded in a timely manner, which may have affected the results of the study. The patient files were not randomly selected however, they were all available complete files over a long two-year period and could be a representative sample of the population. In this study, most potential confounders and variables recorded as much as possible and considered in the joint model as predictor variables to reduce their effect on response and AUC values.\nThis study highlights that conventional coagulation biomarkers (aPTT, PT, and INR) demonstrate significant time-dependent efficacy in predicting in-hospital mortality in comatose TBI patients within the first three days of admission. Early recognition and proper management of coagulopathy are essential to improve outcomes and reduce morbidity and mortality in these patients.\nApproval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, with approval reference IR.USWR.REC.1399.190.

PT reference ranges can vary across different laboratories depending on the reagents and instruments used. However, in most laboratories, the normal range for PT is 10 to 13 seconds. Therefore, to standardize the reporting of PT results, the World Health Organization introduced the INR as a standard format (\nThe INR is commonly used as a surrogate for the PT value, providing a standardized way of reporting PT results.

Pooling research data is needed to develop targeted interventions, using evidence-based practices to prevent HDI in high-risk surgical patients during pre- and postoperative care. This will guide quality improvement (QI) initiatives in Ethiopia’s healthcare setting.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was performed on the incidence and associated factors of HDI among surgical patients in Ethiopia. All studies on incidence and predictors of HDI among surgical patients in Ethiopia published up to January 15, 2025. Our systematic review was adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [\nOur study was registered in PROSPERO under registration number of CRD420250655656.\nWe carried out a thorough search across different databases including ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, Center for Evidence-based Medicine, African Journals Online (AJOL), Excerpta Medical Database, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar to identify studies regarding the incidence and associated factors of HDI among surgical patient in Ethiopia up to January 15, 2025 (Fig.\n\nPRISMA flow diagram of the selection process of studies on incidence and predictors of HDI among surgical patients in Ethiopia\nKeywords were used in the search: ((‘postoperative hemodynamic instability’ OR ‘postoperative hypotension’ OR ‘postoperative bradycardia’ OR ‘postoperative tachycardia’ OR ‘postoperative hypertension’ OR ‘postoperative morbidity’ OR ‘postoperative mortality’ OR ‘postoperative complication’) and (patients OR individuals) and surgical patients OR surgery OR postoperative care unit (PACU)) OR (associated factors OR determinant factors OR risk factors) AND (epidemiology OR prevalence OR incidence) AND (Ethiopia)) (Supplementary file 2).\nWe deemed studies focusing on the incidence and associated factors of HDI among surgical patients to be pertinent.

In total, 86 articles were excluded because of duplication. Of the remaining 394 articles, 331 were removed by title, study population, and abstract, whereas 63 were read in full and assessed for eligibility. Finally, 11 studies with a total of 3,366 participants who fulfilled the eligibility requirements were included (Fig.\nWe finally incorporate a total of 11 studies, among those 6 studies were conducted in Amhara region [\nThe pooled incidence of HDI among surgical patients in Ethiopia was 52.53% (95% CI 41.5, 63.54). A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled incidence of HDI among surgical patients (Fig.\n\nForest plot for pooled incidence of the systematic review and meta-analysis of HDI among surgical patients\nBecause of the significant heterogeneity among the studies, a subgroup analysis was conducted to identify potential sources of heterogeneity.

The results revealed that the studies that were removed had no discernible impact on the pooled incidence of HDI; indicating that our results were robust and not affected by a single study (Fig.\n\nLeave- out one sensitivity analysis for systematic review and meta-analysis of HDI among surgical patients\nTo determine predictors associated with postoperative hemodynamic instability among surgical patients, variables such as age, systolic blood measurement, amount of blood loss, the type of anesthesia used, type of surgery, ASA grade III, crystalloid loading, and body mass index (BMI) were extracted from the included studies. Among these variables, four factors were identified as significant determinants of postoperative hemodynamic instability among surgical patients following surgery: patient age, amount of intraoperative blood loss, ASA class III, and general anesthesia type usage (Table\n\nFactors associated with the incidence of HDI among surgical patients following surgery\nTo assess the association between intraoperative blood loss greater than 500 ml and HDI among surgical patients, three studies were included, all showing a statistically significant link. Our data indicated that individuals with blood loss exceeding 500 ml had a 1.97-fold higher risk of developing HDI compared to those with blood loss under 500 ml (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.03). For the relationship between patient age and HDI, two studies were included, both demonstrating a statistically significant correlation. The odds of developing HDI were nearly three times greater in the older age group (pooled OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.8 to 4.1).\nTwo studies examined the association between types of anesthesia and HDI, with each showing a significant relationship. Patients who received general anesthesia were found to be 3.9 times more likely to develop HDI compared to those who received other anesthesia types (pooled OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 2.56 to 5.96). Finally, to explore the association between ASA class III and HDI, four studies were included, all confirming a significant association. Our systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that being classified as ASA III increases the likelihood of developing HDI by four times (pooled OR = 4, 95% CI = 2.92 to 5.5).\nPostoperative hemodynamic instability is adverse events that occur after surgery and can significantly impact a patient’s recovery and overall surgery outcome. To determine the pooled incidence of HDI among surgical patients following surgery in Ethiopia, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. A thorough finding revealed that the pooled incidence of HDI among surgical patients was 52.53% (95% CI 41.5, 63.54). According to this meta-analysis, the postoperative HDI complication is influenced by patient age, ASA physical status class, intraoperative blood loss, and as well as type of anesthesia selection. Our systematic review result was consistent with those of studies conducted in Thailand [\nWhen compared to the results, studies carried out in Croatia (10.3%) [\nOur research data suggested that HDI was significantly associated with the patient age > 55 years with an odd of 2.7 time’s greater risk of developing with p-value < 0.001; the result is consistent with a findings from study done in Addis Ababa [\nAccording to our research data, patients with ASA class III and above had a 4 (pooled OR = 4, 95% CI = 2.92–5.5) fold increased risk of developing HDI compared with their ASA I and II class physical status with a. It is the fact that the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system provides valuable insights into patients’ overall health status and perioperative risk, with higher ASA classifications correlating with increased complication rates. Our findings were supported by study conducted in Ethiopia [\nAccording to our additional pooled findings, patients with intraoperative blood loss > 500 ml had a 1.97 fold increased risk of developing HDI compared with those intraoperative bleeding amount < 500 ml. This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that excessive blood loss attributed to hemodynamic instability predispose to further complications. Generally, the grater intraoperative blood loss an individual is, more susceptible for developing HDI. This finding was supported with studies conducted in Bangkok Thailand [\nAnesthesia-related factors, such as the choice of anesthesia, also influence postoperative hemodynamic instability. The other additional determinant correlated with HDI was the type of anesthesia usage. On type of anesthesia usage general anesthesia is more of risk for HDI with pooled OR of 3.9 (pooled OR = 3.9, 95% CI, = 2.56 to 5.96), these is due to the fact that general anesthesia causes vasodilation, hypotension and alteration in cardiac rate. For instance a study conducted in Thailand Bangkok [\nGenerally, healthcare providers should prioritize monitoring for postoperative hemodynamic instability in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit. It is recommended closely follow up high-risk patients, implement early detection and intervention for perioperative predictors of HDI, and adhere to institutional protocols for patient handover. These measures can help to reduce the incidence of HDI in the PACU.\nOne of the limitations of our study was the involvement of different study participants. The majority of the included studies originated from two regions, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings to other regions. The included studies were more of cross-sectional for incidence of factors; as a result, the outcome variable might be affected by other confounding variables, decreasing the power of the study and it decreased causal conclusion between HDI, and factors associated with a HDI. The use of clinically well participants, may also contribute to an underestimation of HDI incidence.\nOur systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the pooled incidence of hemodynamic instability was 52.53% reflecting the significant impact of surgery on HDI. HDI remains a significant concern in surgical practice affecting patient outcomes. Intraoperative blood loss > 500 ml, advanced patient age, ASA class III, and types of anesthesia usage are all strong predictors of HDI. Understanding these pivotal factors helps the healthcare personnel to minimize the likelihood of HDI conditions. Patient risk assessment, optimization of preoperative patient condition, intraoperative outcome management, and postoperative care play a pivotal role on minimization of HDI and enhance overall quality of the surgery. In addition to that understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying postoperative hemodynamic instability is essential for developing targeted therapeutic approaches.\nOur findings highlight the urgent need for public health initiatives aimed at improving the monitoring and safety of postoperative hemodynamic instability, as well as addressing its associated predictors. A public health strategy focused on surgical care is essential for the timely recognition and management of these issues. Enhanced recovery protocols and multidisciplinary care teams play a critical role in mitigating risks related with hemodynamic fluctuations, to enhance postoperative recovery and reduced mortality rates.\nAJOL: African Journals Online; BMI: Body Mass Index, ASA: American Society of Anesthesiologists; HDI: Hemodynamic instability PACU: Post Anesthetic-Care Unit; PICO: Population Intervention Comparison Outcome, PRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, QI: Quality Initiative, UK: United Kingdom.\n\nSupplementary Material 1.\nSupplementary Material 2.", "content_for_embedding": "Surgery is a pivotal component of healthcare worldwide, significantly contributing to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of various medical conditions.

A global systematic review conducted by Edina Tar et al. indicated that hemodynamic instability is linked to higher mortality rates, and in cases of acute gastrointestinal bleeding, up to 30% of patients experience some level of hemodynamic instability after surgery [\nThe significant incidence of HDI in low-income country indicates a considerable, unmet health challenge across the region.

While direct effects such as cognitive and physical impairments are well documented, recent research has linked TBI to neurodegenerative changes similar to dementia. TBI-related neurodegeneration includes progressive brain-tissue degeneration that leads to behavioral changes, cognitive decline, and dementia-like symptoms. The exact underlying mechanisms are complex, and include neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and disruption to protein homeostasis. Neuroinflammation is controlled by the activation of astrocytes and microglia and causes neuronal damage and the prolonged release of proinflammatory cytokines. Oxidative stress damages cell and impairs mitochondrial function, while the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as tau and β-amyloid mimics the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Excitotoxicity involves excessive neurotransmitter release that may lead to further injuries. Epidemiological studies show that the risk of dementia is increased after moderate-to-severe TBI and influenced by age and genetic factors. Current management strategies focus on symptom relief, and there is ongoing research aimed at improving the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the development of effective treatments.", "full_text": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) newly affects approximately 2.8 million Americans annually, with 15%–30% of survivors developing chronic neurodegeneration.\nWhile immediate consequences of TBI such as cognitive impairment and physical disability are well recognized, recent research has highlighted its long-term neurodegenerative effects, including dementia-like pathology.\nMultifactorial mechanisms underlie TBI-ND, with neuroinflammation being a central driver.\nEpidemiological studies have demonstrated that the incidence of dementia is higher among TBI survivors, particularly after moderate or severe injuries characterized by scores on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 9–12 and 3–8, respectively. Mild TBI is characterized by GCS scores of 13–15, with confusion/disorientation lasting <24 hours and/or loss of consciousness <30 minutes.\nTBI-ND shares pathological features with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal dementia,\nTBI-ND is currently managed palliatively, with a focus on controlling diverse symptoms. The approaches include providing affected patients with cognitive rehabilitation, psychopharmacology (e.g., acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for memory improvement), and behavioral therapy, and also providing caregivers with appropriate support. Disease-modifying therapies remain elusive, underscoring the urgency for preventive strategies and mechanistic research.\nEpidemiological studies have been instrumental in interpreting the complex relationship between TBI and the subsequent development of neurodegenerative disorders, including dementia. By examining large populations over extended periods, these studies have provided valuable insights into the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes associated with TBI-ND.\nRecent advances in neuroepidemiology have substantially improved the understanding of TBI as a dynamic risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. Large-scale studies have revealed a clear dose–response relationship between TBI and dementia risk, with moderate-to-severe injuries being associated with a 2.8-fold higher risk of dementia (odds ratio [OR]=2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.1–3.7), while repetitive mild TBIs—which are particularly prevalent in contact-sport athletes—demonstrate even stronger associations with specific tauopathies (OR=3.2, 95% CI=2.4–4.3).\nModern genetic studies have expanded beyond the traditional APOE ε4 risk (OR=4.1 for Alzheimer's disease) to identify new genetic risk markers, including the TMEM106B rs1990622 variant that independently doubles the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) (OR=2.1, 95% CI=1.5–3.0) in neuropathologically confirmed cases.\nThe collective evidence is summarized in\nPrevious studies have underscored the complex interplay between individual susceptibility and external exposures in determining the long-term outcomes of TBI. The subtype-specific interactions observed—with strong associations with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia but weak links with Lewy-body dementia and frontotemporal dementia—highlight the need for precise diagnostic frameworks when evaluating post-TBI cognitive decline.\nRecent research has precisely characterized how specific genetic variants and environmental exposures interact with TBI to drive neurodegeneration. The APOE ε4 allele exerts the strongest genetic effect,\nThe pathophysiology of TBI-ND is characterized by a cascade of complex, interconnected mechanisms that contribute to progressive brain damage and cognitive decline over time.\nThe present review focuses on how neuroinflammation plays a central role in TBI-ND progression. Cellular damage occurring immediately post-TBI leads to the release of DAMPs (damage-associated molecules) from injured cells, such as HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1 protein) and HSPs (heat-shock proteins), which activate the brain's innate immune system. This in turn activates the brain's resident immune cells (microglia), which release proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators.\nTBI-ND presents clinically with a diverse array of symptoms that often overlap with those observed in various forms of dementia. These symptoms encompass cognitive impairments, mood disturbances, and behavioral changes, which can significantly impact the functional abilities of individuals and their quality of life. Memory impairment in TBI-ND is characterized by difficulties in learning new information, recalling past events, and retaining recently acquired knowledge.\nDiagnosing TBI-ND requires comprehensive evaluations encompassing a detailed medical history, thorough clinical assessment, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging studies, and biomarker analyses. A comprehensive medical history helps identify the presence of prior TBIs, the severity of these injuries, and potential risk factors for neurodegeneration such as genetic predisposition, comorbid medical conditions, and environmental exposures.\nWhile cognitive impairment dominates TBI-ND, motor sequelae are increasingly being recognized. Population-based studies have revealed that the probability of parkinsonism onset is higher after moderate-to-severe TBI during middle adulthood,\nSurgical interventions are often needed in severe cases of TBI particularly those involving elevated intracranial pressure, hematomas, or skull fractures.\nThe management of TBI-ND requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach aimed at addressing the complex array of cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial sequelae associated with this debilitating condition,\nThe involvement of caregivers and family members is also critical to TBI-ND management. Providing caregivers with education and support is essential to help families understand the nature of TBI-ND, manage its symptoms effectively, and provide appropriate care. The complexity and chronic nature of TBI-ND mean that caregivers play pivotal roles in both the day-to-day care and long-term well-being of affected individuals.\nReducing caregiver burden and preventing burnout are also crucial objectives of caregiver support programs. Acting as a caregiver for an individual with TBI-ND can be physically, emotionally, and mentally demanding, and often leads to significant stress and burnout. Providing caregivers with resources that offer temporary relief from their caregiving duties, such as respite care services, can be invaluable.\nPharmacotherapy plays a complementary role in the management of TBI-ND, targeting specific symptoms and neuropsychiatric complications associated with the condition.\nSpecific medications are selected based on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's symptoms and medical history, as well as their potential side effects. Close monitoring and regular follow-up are essential to optimize medication efficacy, minimize side effects, and ensure treatment adherence. Regular follow-up appointments allow healthcare professionals to assess how a patient responds to medications, adjust dosages as necessary, and address any side effects. Such ongoing evaluations help to fine-tune the pharmacological regimen to meet the patient's evolving needs. Furthermore, providing both patients and caregivers with education about the purpose and potential side effects of medications is critical for promoting adherence and ensuring their safe use. By involving patients and caregivers in the decision-making process and providing clear instructions, healthcare professionals can improve treatment outcomes and the overall management of TBI-ND.\nThe management of TBI-ND requires a comprehensive, patient-centered approach that integrates multidisciplinary collaboration with supportive interventions to address the complex medical, cognitive, emotional, and social challenges associated with the condition. Multidisciplinary collaboration involving the coordinated efforts of various healthcare professionals is essential for developing and implementing holistic, individualized treatment plans. The multidisciplinary team requires specialized expertise from key members who typically include neurologists, neuropsychologists, psychiatrists, occupational therapists, speech-language therapists, and social workers.\nNeurologists in the multidisciplinary team focus on diagnosing and treating the neurological aspects of TBI-ND, such as monitoring disease progression and managing symptoms through medical interventions. Neuropsychologists assess cognitive function and deliver targeted rehabilitation strategies tailored to the patient's deficits. Psychiatrists address comorbid psychiatric conditions, including mood and anxiety disorders. Occupational therapists assist patients in regaining functional independence by enhancing motor skills and coordination. Speech-language therapists provide therapies aimed at improving communication, language, and cognitive-communication skills. Social workers offer counseling, connecting patients with community resources, and facilitating navigation of complex healthcare systems. These professionals collaborate closely through regular multidisciplinary meetings to review patient progression, share clinical insights, and modify treatment plans based on evolving needs and outcomes. Supportive interventions complement this clinical framework by targeting broader psychosocial and environmental dimensions. Vocational rehabilitation programs facilitate the reintegration of individuals with TBI-ND into the workforce by offering job training, career counseling, placement services, and workplace accommodations tailored to the individual's cognitive and physical abilities. These programs promote economic independence and improve social engagement.\nPeer support groups offer opportunities for individuals with TBI-ND to share their lived experiences, receive emotional support, and exchange practical strategies for coping with daily challenges. Such interactions can improve their mental health and give them a stronger sense of community. Caregiver education and support are also vital components of care. Education programs equip caregivers with knowledge about symptom management, behavioral interventions, and communication strategies, while support groups provide emotional relief, peer validation, and access to resources for preventing burnout.\nEnvironmental modifications are another critical aspect of supportive care. These may include the installation of assistive fixtures such as grab bars and ramps, the rearrangement of living spaces to improve safety, and the use of visual aids or memory cues to support daily routines.\nThe effectiveness of both multidisciplinary collaboration and supportive interventions depends on their alignment with the individual's unique goals, preferences, and life context. A personalized, flexible care plan—continuously refined through regular assessments—ensures that interventions remain relevant, effective, and responsive. Such an integrated approach improves health outcomes, the quality of life, and the long-term rehabilitation and community reintegration of individuals living with TBI-ND.\nThe chronic and progressive nature of TBI-ND also make ongoing monitoring and long-term management essential components of the care provided to individuals with TBI-ND. Effective management of TBI-ND requires a sustained, proactive approach that adapts to the evolving needs of the individual over time.\nThe dynamic nature of TBI-ND means that new challenges can arise over time, including changes in mobility, communication abilities, mental health, and social interactions. Frequent follow-ups allow healthcare professionals to address these emerging needs promptly. For example, if a patient develops new difficulties with mobility, physical therapy can be introduced to maintain their functional independence. Similarly, new behavioral or mood issues can be managed with appropriate therapeutic interventions. Continuous support is vital for both individuals with TBI-ND and their families.\nEffective long-term management of TBI-ND often also requires more than addressing the clinical situation.\nTBI-ND poses significant clinical and societal challenges due to its complex pathophysiology involving neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and disrupted proteostasis. These mechanisms contribute to progressive cognitive decline and functional impairment that resemble the effects of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

First, due to the nature of trauma ECMO therapy, there is a paucity of prospective research in this field, as most studies are retrospective, small sample–sized, and even case series, with moderate to high risk of bias and heterogeneity, resulting in low to very low-quality of evidence. Second, the role of VA-ECMO in TCA and cardiogenic shock needs to be further determined. Most studies involved a small number of cases, even sporadic, without describing the characteristics of the patients and the criteria for VA-ECMO initiation, which precluded the synthesis of evidence supporting its application to those most likely to benefit. Third, owing to insufficient data and wide variation in clinical practice across the trauma ECMO centers, the panel was unable to propose standard schemes for the minimum anticoagulation strategy, traumatic lethal triad prediction, ultrasound-guided fluid management, and preventive measures of ECMO-related complications. The recommendations largely depended on expert experience and opinions, and its reliability and validity need to be further confirmed. Fourth, the long-term outcomes and quality of life of trauma ECMO survivors should be further determined, especially whether the improvement of survival comes at the expense of developing organic and cognitive disabilities among patients, as this has an impact on the generalization of trauma ECMO and patient preference. Therefore, well-designed clinical trials or large-sample prospective studies are needed to provide vigorous evidence supporting ECMO use in adult trauma patients with refractory acute cardiopulmonary failure, in accordance with the individual characteristics of these patients with varied injury mechanisms.\n\nSchematic diagram of the implementation of ECMO in trauma patient.

Each centre will recruit eligible patients consecutively and collect data in detail in the case report form (CRF). Those who are excluded will also be recorded in detail.\nThis study is a prospective cohort study, so the subjects will not be randomised or blinded. The hyperosmolar agent will be selected by the attending doctor on the basis of their overall evaluation. At the step of analysis, the participants will be divided into mannitol group (20% mannitol, 3 mL/kg) and HTS group (10% NaCl, 1 mL/kg) according to the agent used.\nData including demographic information (sex, age, height and weight (body mass index (BMI))), medical history, conditions used for screening (preadmission functional status, Glasgow score (GCS), H-H grades, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) scores, mRS, temperature, mean arterial pressure (MBP), site and obliteration of aneurysms), other management (agent and dose of hyperosmolar therapy, DC or not) and daily monitoring data (vital signs, analysis of blood gas and blood biochemistry) will be collected. The vital signs of all the patients are continuously monitored by our local intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring system (PHILIPS MX700). Multimodality monitoring information will also be collected synchronously with vital signs if the ICP or flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery or percutaneous brain tissue oxygenation monitoring (Tissue Oxygenation saturation Index (TOI)) is available. For patients with ICP monitoring, the ICP-related parameters (ICP, blood pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), mean ICP wave amplitude (MWA), correlation of ICP amplitude and ICP mean (RAP), ICP-ABP wave amplitude correlation(IAAC)) will be collected simultaneously by Neuro Critical Care Data Software (NCCDS-111, NEUSTRO, Codman) at a frequency of 120 Hz. For patients with near infra red spectrum (NIRS) monitoring, the TOI and tissue haemoglobin index (THI) will be collected by EGOS-600 (ENGINMED, China) in a frequency of 50 Hz. Data will be collected on days 1–7, 10 and 14 after enrolment (the day of enrolment will be day 1), 30 days, 3 months and 6 months after ictus. The primary endpoint is defined as the mRS score at 30 days after ictus, secondary endpoint as mRS score at 6 months and the incidence of complications during the whole hospitalisation.\nThe data collection time points (days 1–7, 10 and 14, 30 days, 3 and 6 months) are presented in the timeline (\nHyperosmolar therapy is important in the management of cerebral oedema and high ICP, both of which are common presentations in patients with severe SAH. Most clinical evidence is derived from studies on patients with TBI, whereas less exists for aneurysmal SAH. Thus, we will conduct this prospective observational study, aiming to provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of hyperosmolar therapy for aneurysmal SAH with a H-H score ≥3. The primary outcome is the modified Rankin score (mRS) at 30 days after ictus. The secondary outcomes are the mRS score at 6 months and the incidence of complications during hospitalisation, including phlebitis, AKI, hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypernatraemia, vessel spasm, delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI), subdural effusion and hydrocephalus.\nThe sample size of this study is based on the retrospective data from Xuanwu Hospital. A retrospective analysis of patients with aneurysmal SAH treated at Xuanwu Hospital between June 2016 and June 2022 revealed that the modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores at discharge were 2.3±1.68 and 1.53±1.12 for patients who received mannitol and hypertonic sodium chloride, respectively. Assuming a two-sided type I error of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, with a 10% dropout rate, 62 patients in each group are needed.\nThe enrolled patients will be divided into mannitol or HTS groups according to the hyperosmolar agent they will receive. Demographic and baseline characteristics are presented as means and standard deviations (or medians with IQRs) for continuous variables and frequency distributions with percentages for categorical variables. The differences between the groups will be compared with the independent sample t test or the Mann‒Whitney test for continuous variables and χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. The analyses included all the subjects with treatment data, with the last observation carried forwards to account for missing data. A multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to evaluate the associations between the hyperosmolar agent and outcome (favourable or unfavourable) at 30 days, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, history of comorbidity and screening conditions (preadmission functional status, GCS, H-H grade, WFNS score, mRS score, temperature, mean arterial pressure (MBP), site and obliteration of aneurysms). ORs with 95% CIs will be calculated. All the statistical tests will be two-sided, and the level of significance will be set at 0.05. All the statistical analyses will be conducted using SPSS V.26.0.\nAs this is an observational multicentre study, the section bias and centre bias cannot be completely eliminated. Each enrolment will be reported to the steering committee, and a monthly online meeting will be held among all the participating centres to discuss issues during study execution. If enrolment in one group is more than the other, the enrolment in this group will slow down. Based on this arrangement and the burden of SAH patients in each participating centre, the enrolment gap between the two groups will be less than five each month. The centre bias also cannot be neglected, as some centres may prefer one osmotic agent or another, and this will be analysed in the substudy. The relationship between hyperosmolar agents and ICP (including episodes of intracranial hypertension) will also be presented in a substudy.\nDue to the observational nature of this study, only association relationship will be reported. Randomised controlled trial is needed in the future.\nSelective bias and centre bias may also occur because of the nature of study design, as some centres may prefer one agent or the other. A substudy of centre bias will be performed in the future.\nThe blood sodium level may change quickly during and after infusion of osmotic agents, but because of the insurance restrictions and ethics considerations, blood sodium tests are designed to be taken two times every day, which is before and after the infusion of the first administration of daily osmotic agents. Then, the changing curve of blood sodium level can be derived and put into the analysis with endpoints.\nNone.\nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of Xuanwu Hospital (approval date: 10 July 2023) under protocol V.2.0 (version date: 26 April 2023). Each participating centre also should receive ethics approval from their local authorities if needed before the first patient is enrolled. The data monitoring committee is responsible for supervising screening, enrolment and data recording and ensuring such practices are in strict accordance with the protocol. Any amendment to the protocol must be reviewed and approved by the steering committee before the changes are implemented in the study. For patients not able to provide informed consent at the time of recruitment, their next of kin will serve as their legal representative. Screening will start after informed consent is obtained.

The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and reported at relevant professional conferences regardless of the results. Authorship will be given in accordance with definitions put forward by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.\nAll the data collected at each participating centre will ultimately be stored at Xuanwu Hospital, which has priority and responsibility for all the data collected.

Each enrolment will be reported to the steering committee, and a monthly online meeting will be held among all the participating centres to discuss issues during study execution. If enrolment in one group is more than the other, the enrolment in this group will slow down. Based on this arrangement and the burden of SAH patients in each participating centre, the enrolment gap between the two groups will be less than five each month. The centre bias also cannot be neglected, as some centres may prefer one osmotic agent or another, and this will be analysed in the substudy. The relationship between hyperosmolar agents and ICP (including episodes of intracranial hypertension) will also be presented in a substudy.\nDue to the observational nature of this study, only association relationship will be reported. Randomised controlled trial is needed in the future.\nSelective bias and centre bias may also occur because of the nature of study design, as some centres may prefer one agent or the other. A substudy of centre bias will be performed in the future.\nThe blood sodium level may change quickly during and after infusion of osmotic agents, but because of the insurance restrictions and ethics considerations, blood sodium tests are designed to be taken two times every day, which is before and after the infusion of the first administration of daily osmotic agents. Then, the changing curve of blood sodium level can be derived and put into the analysis with endpoints.\nNone.\nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of Xuanwu Hospital (approval date: 10 July 2023) under protocol V.2.0 (version date: 26 April 2023). Each participating centre also should receive ethics approval from their local authorities if needed before the first patient is enrolled. The data monitoring committee is responsible for supervising screening, enrolment and data recording and ensuring such practices are in strict accordance with the protocol. Any amendment to the protocol must be reviewed and approved by the steering committee before the changes are implemented in the study. For patients not able to provide informed consent at the time of recruitment, their next of kin will serve as their legal representative. Screening will start after informed consent is obtained. If the patient regains capacity during the follow-up period, they will be informed of the study and asked to consent to the study procedure, any suggestion will be fully respected and refusal to participate will be accepted.\nAs this study is an observational study in which SAH will be managed routinely,\nThe study will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and the International Conference on Harmonisation for Good Clinical Practice. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and reported at relevant professional conferences regardless of the results. Authorship will be given in accordance with definitions put forward by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.\nAll the data collected at each participating centre will ultimately be stored at Xuanwu Hospital, which has priority and responsibility for all the data collected. Each centre owns its data. The data can only be used for scientific purposes. Any requests for data use will be reviewed by the steering committee.\nAnonymous data will be recorded into uniform case report forms with a unique study identification number according to enrolment sequences. Electronic data will be stored in Excel forms and backed up in multiple locations. All original files will be kept by the principal investigator (PI) for up to 7 years after the completion of the study. Any request for data use, which is limited to scientific analysis, must be approved by the steering committee.\nAccording to the inclusion criteria, the patients included in this study have different levels of disturbances of consciousness. For patients not able to provide informed consent at the time of recruitment, their next of kin will be their legal representative.\nIf the patient regains capacity during the follow-up period, they will be informed of the study and asked to consent to the study procedure, any suggestion will be fully respected and refusal to participate will be accepted.", "topic": "TBI"}

Studies in nonintubated spontaneously breathing patients have also been limited due to the relatively rare use of sidestream or microstream capnometer in the ED. Considering these lacunae in the existing literature, we conducted a prospective observational study to assess the ability of EtCO2 in monitoring and prognostication of patients presenting to the ED with shock of nontraumatic etiology.\nIt was a single-center prospective observational study in the ED of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India.

Data including demographic profile, comorbid diseases, presenting complaints, cause of shock, type of shock, intubation status, and disposition were collected in a predesigned questionnaire. One milliliter heparinized blood samples were drawn for estimation of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), lactate, and BD at 0 and 120 min of presentation.

While EtCO2 measurement in intubated patients may be considered a noninvasive, continuous, and reliable monitoring tool in critically ill patients, the same in nonintubated patients may be challenging as different sampling adapters are shown to have variable reliability. Further, the availability of such sampling adapters may be limited in many centers, especially in developing nations like India.

Larger studies among nonintubated patients are required to determine the reliability and feasibility of capnography in such a patient population.\nThe technique of capnography-mainstream or sidestream could also potentially affect the reliability and accuracy of the results obtained. The mainstream technique is theoretically associated with more accurate values as they are not affected by circuit obstructions, drops in water pressure, or gaseous dispersion.[\nThe utility of EtCO2 for monitoring of circulatory insufficiency is also limited in patients with complex pulmonary pathologies, who have been excluded from our study. While conditions such as bronchial asthma and obstructive airway diseases could show increased EtCO2 values due to chronic airflow limitation, other conditions such as pulmonary embolism could show decreased values due to impaired alveolar perfusion.

There was no statistically significant difference in terms of survival concerning CAD and underlying heart rhythm, but survivors had a higher proportion of non-CAD and shockable rhythms. In patients with shockable rhythm, survival differences by CAD status were not statistically significant. The absence of statistical significance, despite clear numerical differences, is most likely attributable to the limited sample size of patients.\nKaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no difference in long-term survival concerning underlying CAD in all patients, but a clear survival benefit for patients with initially shockable rhythm and no proof of CAD. Patients with CAD and shockable heart rhythm were significantly older and had a shorter CPR duration, albeit not statistically significant. There was a high proportion of individuals dying due to cerebrovascular hypoxia, which might be a potential bias.\nKaplan-Meier analysis without individuals dying due to cerebrovascular injury, showed no significant differences in terms of survival between CAD and NON-CAD patients. While in this cohort, CPR duration did not differ significantly between the groups, the huge age-gap between CAD and NON-CAD patients remained.\nThe observed decline of the Kaplan-Meier survival curve to zero reflects the end of the follow-up period rather than an abrupt mortality event, and should not be misinterpreted as a plotting artifact.\nTo further rule out potential confounders, propensity-score matching in respect to age, gender, shockable heart rhythm, CPR duration and LVEF was performed.\nIn this matched population, survival to discharge rate was still 40 % and did not differ between CAD and NON-CAD patients (see\nOne might assume that patients with CAD receiving ECPR would have improved survival rates due to the treatability of the underlying condition. Interestingly, in our cohort, the presence of treatable CAD did not confer a survival advantage. This is most likely due to the small sample size and cannot be generalized for larger cohorts.\nSurvival rate in our cohort was rather high compared to the 8–31 % reported in the literature.\nConsistent with our results, a clear survival advantage for ECPR-patients with an initially shockable rhythm exists in literature.\nAll survivors had a favorable neurological outcome in our group, independent of underlying CAD or initial heart rhythm. Looking at the PSM cohort, all of the 12 survivors to discharge exhibited good neurological outcome. However, the CPC score is only assessed in survivors after hospital discharge and is not recorded in patients who die during hospitalization, which represents a potential source of ascertainment bias.\nOld age and longer duration of CPR prior to ECMO were independent risk factors for poor neurological outcome.\nSeveral\nIn our study, underlying CAD or primary rhythm at cardiac arrest did not impact neurological outcome. So far, no study analyzed the impact of CAD on neurological outcome in patients receiving ECPR, though many have dealt with the influence of the primary heart rhythm at cardiac arrest. Inoue, Yannopoulos and Lunz et al found initially shockable rhythm as independent predictor of favorable neurological outcome.\nSeveral limitations must be acknowledged. First, the sample size was relatively small, especially after propensity score matching. The data collection relied on retrospective data acquisition of a single center conducted in a specific geographical region, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Future research should consider longitudinal approaches and larger multi-center samples to further validate the results.\nDespite the overall high mortality associated with ECPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), our study demonstrated a survival rate of 44.8 %, with 96.2 % of survivors achieving favorable neurological outcomes. Patients with shockable initial rhythms and without underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) showed a numerically higher survival, suggesting these factors may be associated with improved outcomes. Although these differences did not reach statistical significance, they highlight the importance of initial rhythm and cardiac pathology in patient selection and prognostication. The implementation of pre-hospital ECPR in a well-organized system has the potential to markedly improve outcomes for OHCA patients. However, further trials on prehospital cannulation are needed to further investigate the potential benefit for the patient. Out-of-hospital ECMO implantation should be reserved for highly experienced centers, given the complexity and risks associated with this procedure.\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.", "content_for_embedding": "Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is still associated with high mortality despite advancements in emergency medical care.\nThis study aimed to evaluate short-term and long-term survival of patients receiving on-site ECPR for OHCA, with neurological outcomes.

However, secondary brain injury has become a key focus in translational research, with oxidative stress (OS) identified as a central factor in ICH pathophysiology. Following ICH, hematoma components and inflammatory factors overwhelm the antioxidant defense system, triggering OS. Concurrently, neuroinflammation arises, driven by activated microglia that adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype and release cytokines and chemokines. While neuroinflammation may support repair, it can also cause harmful secondary damage. Recent evidence indicates that NLRP3 is an important inflammasome considered a key player in OS and neuroinflammation. OS can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), further exacerbating the inflammatory response. Additionally, NLRP3 also plays an important role in regulating neuroinflammation. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, further intensifying the neuroinflammatory response. The activation of NLRP3 is closely related to the polarization of microglia, potentially driving microglia to polarize towards the M1 type (pro-inflammatory), thereby exacerbating neuroinflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that NLRP3 plays a critical regulatory role in OS and neuroinflammation following ICH. This review summarizes the regulatory role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the interplay between OS and neuroinflammation, as well as its potential therapeutic targets related to ICH.", "full_text": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe neurological disorder caused by the rupture of blood vessels within the brain parenchyma, characterized by high mortality rates and significant neurological dysfunction.\nBrain injury caused by ICH is generally believed to primarily include primary injury resulting from direct compression and stimulation by hematomas, and secondary brain injury induced by the pathophysiological reactions of hematomas (\nMechanisms following ICH. Primary injury results from hematoma compression, elevating intracranial pressure and reducing cerebral blood flow. Secondary injury involves cytotoxicity, inflammation, and OS triggered by thrombin, hemoglobin/iron release, and complement activation. These processes disrupt BBB, induce edema, and promote neuronal death, persisting from minutes to weeks post-ICH.\nOS refers to the excessive imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or a deficiency in the antioxidant system within cells. Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are primarily composed of nitric oxide and its derivatives (\nMajor pathways of ROS/RNS generation after ICH. ICH induces erythrocyte lysis, releasing hemoglobin and heme engulfed by microglia/macrophages. Hemoglobin oxidation produces free radicals, while heme oxygenase (HO) degrades heme into iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide. Transferrin-mediated iron transport facilitates Fenton reactions with H2O2, generating cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Mitochondrial dysfunction (via IMAC/mPTP) and glutamate-triggered NMDA receptor activation promote calcium overload, stimulating neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and NADPH oxidases (NOXs) to synthesize nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2•−), which combine into peroxynitrite (ONOO−). Microglial NOX/NOS systems further amplify OS, exacerbating neuronal injury.\nOxidative stress-mediated brain injury mechanisms after ICH. Excessive ROS/RNS production overwhelms endogenous antioxidant defenses, causing oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. This activates molecular pathways triggering apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy. Concurrently, OS stimulates NF-κB signaling, upregulating proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs degrade cerebrovascular basement membranes and tight junctions, increasing capillary permeability and exacerbating BBB disruption. Direct oxidative injury to endothelial cells further compromises BBB integrity, facilitating neuroinflammation and secondary brain injury.\nInflammation is an important host defense response to brain injury, particularly following ICH (\nInflammatory responses after ICH. After ICH, multiple blood components (eg erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets) are released into the brain parenchyma where they can activate microglia, astrocytes, and mast cells by distinct pathways. After activation, microglia upregulate the expression of NLRP3 and TSPO and produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory factors. However, they also produce anti-inflammatory factors such as TGF-b which contributes to brain repair. Astrocytes contribute to the composition of the BBB and are destroyed directly after ICH, leading to BBB disruption. In addition, astrocytes secrete various pro-inflammatory factors that aggravate neuronal injury and brain damage. Pro-inflammatory factors from diverse cell types not only exacerbate BBB disruption and leukocyte infiltration, but also kill neurons directly.\nThe inflammasome is an oligomeric protein complex distributed in the cytoplasm, playing a crucial role in the innate immune response in central nervous system (CNS) diseases.\nSchematic representation of the components of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its simple activation process in ICH. The NLRP3 inflammasome comprises three core components: NLRP3 scaffold (containing N-terminal pyrin/PYD, central NACHT, and C-terminal LRR domains), ASC adaptor, and caspase-1 effector. Danger signal recognition induces NLRP3 oligomerization through NACHT domain interactions. These oligomers recruit ASC via PYD domain binding, triggering ASC speck formation. ASC specks subsequently engage pro-caspase-1 through CARD-CARD interactions, enabling its autocatalytic cleavage into active caspase-1. Mature caspase-1 processes pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β/IL-18 into biologically active forms, driving post-ICH neuroinflammation.\nHowever, it is well known that the activation of the classical NLRP3 inflammasome requires two distinct steps: priming (signal 1) and activation (signal 2).\nDual-Signal activation mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome and pathological effects in ICH. NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires sequential priming (Signal 1) and triggering (Signal 2). Priming involves TLRs/TNFRs-mediated NF-κB activation, upregulating NLRP3 and cytokine precursors (pro-IL-1β/IL-18). Triggering occurs through heme/P2X7R/K\nUnlike the canonical caspase-1-dependent mechanism, the alternative activation pathway of the NLRP3 inflammasome operates via caspase-4/5/11. When Gram-negative bacteria are phagocytosed by immune cells, their membrane components are degraded, releasing lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS directly binds to and activates mouse caspase-11 or human caspase-4/5, leading to the oligomerization and auto-cleavage of these caspases, which subsequently triggers the non-canonical activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.\nThe alternative activation pathway of the NLRP3 inflammasome operates via a single-signal mechanism and has only been identified in human monocytes. In this pathway, TLR4 recognizes extracellular LPS and triggers NLRP3 activation through the caspase-8/FADD/receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) signaling pathway, thereby promoting NLRP3 activation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, this process does not lead to ASC speck formation nor does it induce pyroptosis.\nNLRP3 inflammasomes, along with NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes, are all composed of pattern recognition receptor/sensor proteins, adaptor proteins, and effector enzymes.\nAfter ICH, brain tissue is affected by hematoma, components of red blood cells, and inflammatory factors, leading to an overload of the antioxidant defense system and subsequently triggering OS.\nInteractions Between OS and NLRP3 Inflammasome in ICH: Key Mechanisms and Therapeutic Interventions\nAfter ICH, brain tissue undergoes a series of pathophysiological changes, among which neuroinflammation is an important process.\nNLRP3 Inflammasome-Mediated Neuroinflammation in ICH: Cellular Mechanisms and Feedback Loops\nFollowing ICH, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can exacerbate neuroinflammation. The reduction of endogenous hydrogen sulfide, combined with P2X7 receptor activation, jointly promotes the recruitment and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, further triggering neuroinflammation in ICH.\nAfter ICH, in addition to directly activating the NLRP3 inflammasome to exacerbate neuroinflammation, the NLRP3 inflammasome can further aggravate neuroinflammation by releasing inflammatory factors upon activation. Research has indicated that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome after ICH promotes the polarization of microglia toward the M1 phenotype, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and exacerbating neuroinflammation.\nMicroRNAs are a class of small RNA molecules that play a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation.

Unfortunately, effective pharmacological or surgical interventions that significantly improve neurological outcomes for patients remain lacking. This review systematically dissects the intricate and destructive interplay between OS and neuroinflammation in secondary brain injury following ICH. For the first time, it places the NLRP3 inflammasome, a pivotal mediator, at the center, highlighting its critical role in orchestrating this detrimental “oxidation-inflammation vicious cycle.”\nThis review thoroughly elucidates the pathological processes of OS and neuroinflammation after ICH. We emphasize that OS rapidly develops after ICH, particularly under the influence of hematoma components (eg, erythrocyte lysis products, hemoglobin, iron) and inflammatory factors. The overwhelmed antioxidant defense system leads to the massive production of ROS and RNS, which not only directly damages cells and disrupts the BBB but, more importantly, creates favorable conditions for the initiation and progression of inflammatory responses. Concurrently, neuroinflammation ensues, primarily characterized by the rapid activation of microglia and their polarization towards a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, alongside the copious release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Notably, neuroinflammation is not entirely detrimental; its early or moderate responses may contribute to hematoma clearance and tissue repair. However, uncontrolled or excessively sustained inflammatory responses trigger harmful secondary injury, exacerbating BBB disruption, brain edema, and neuronal death, ultimately leading to neurological dysfunction. A core finding of this review is its clear delineation of the NLRP3 inflammasome as a crucial nexus and amplifier in the “vicious cycle” between OS and neuroinflammation. Extensive evidence indicates that ROS generation is a key signal for activating the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby initiating subsequent inflammatory cascades. Once activated, NLRP3 not only promotes the maturation and release of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, but critically, these pro-inflammatory factors, in turn, further augment OS production and drive sustained microglial polarization towards a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. This establishes a self-sustaining, escalating pathological cycle that continuously exacerbates neuronal damage, brain edema, and BBB disruption. This “pathological triad” of OS-NLRP3-neuroinflammation constitutes a core driving force of ICH secondary brain injury.\nGiven the pivotal mediating role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in ICH pathophysiology, strategically disrupting this NLRP3-ROS-neuroinflammation axis undoubtedly presents a highly attractive therapeutic target for mitigating ICH secondary injury. Diverse and promising intervention strategies currently exist, including indirect inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by modulating miRNA expression, which offers new avenues for gene-level therapies. Intervening with signaling pathways such as TLR4/MyD88, PI3K/AKT, and Nrf2 to inhibit NLRP3 activation at its source holds broader regulatory potential. Directly targeting NLRP3 with specific small molecule inhibitors like MCC950 and OLT1177 has demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects. However, despite these encouraging findings, translating these research outcomes into clinical practice still faces numerous challenges. Future research should focus on drug specificity and systemic safety, optimal timing of intervention, translation from models to clinics, and a deeper understanding of the “double-edged sword” role of NLRP3 in inflammatory responses, which are crucial for future precision therapies. In summary, this review not only systematically summarizes the pivotal role played by the NLRP3 inflammasome in ICH secondary brain injury, particularly through mediating the vicious cycle between OS and neuroinflammation, but also provides a solid theoretical foundation and abundant target information for preclinical research and future translational medicine. We firmly believe that a deeper understanding and targeted intervention of the NLRP3 pathway, particularly by overcoming current research limitations, will bring new hope for improved outcomes for ICH patients.\nThe extensive evidence presented in this review unequivocally points to NLRP3’s central role in the pathological process of ICH, particularly as a critical nexus in the vicious cycle between OS and neuroinflammation. Therefore, early and precise targeted inhibition of NLRP3 holds promise as a highly effective neuroprotective strategy, capable of interrupting ICH-induced oxidative damage and neuroinflammatory cascades, and thereby significantly improving patients’ neurological functional outcomes. However, successfully translating these encouraging preclinical findings into safe and effective clinical interventions still necessitates continuous and rigorous translational research to fully unlock the immense potential of NLRP3 in ICH treatment.", "content_for_embedding": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe neurological disorder caused by the rupture of blood vessels within the brain parenchyma, characterized by high mortality rates and significant neurological dysfunction.\nBrain injury caused by ICH is generally believed to primarily include primary injury resulting from direct compression and stimulation by hematomas, and secondary brain injury induced by the pathophysiological reactions of hematomas (\nMechanisms following ICH. Primary injury results from hematoma compression, elevating intracranial pressure and reducing cerebral blood flow. Secondary injury involves cytotoxicity, inflammation, and OS triggered by thrombin, hemoglobin/iron release, and complement activation. These processes disrupt BBB, induce edema, and promote neuronal death, persisting from minutes to weeks post-ICH.\nOS refers to the excessive imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or a deficiency in the antioxidant system within cells. Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are primarily composed of nitric oxide and its derivatives (\nMajor pathways of ROS/RNS generation after ICH. ICH induces erythrocyte lysis, releasing hemoglobin and heme engulfed by microglia/macrophages. Hemoglobin oxidation produces free radicals, while heme oxygenase (HO) degrades heme into iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide. Transferrin-mediated iron transport facilitates Fenton reactions with H2O2, generating cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Mitochondrial dysfunction (via IMAC/mPTP) and glutamate-triggered NMDA receptor activation promote calcium overload, stimulating neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and NADPH oxidases (NOXs) to synthesize nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2•−), which combine into peroxynitrite (ONOO−). Microglial NOX/NOS systems further amplify OS, exacerbating neuronal injury.\nOxidative stress-mediated brain injury mechanisms after ICH. Excessive ROS/RNS production overwhelms endogenous antioxidant defenses, causing oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. This activates molecular pathways triggering apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy. Concurrently, OS stimulates NF-κB signaling, upregulating proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs degrade cerebrovascular basement membranes and tight junctions, increasing capillary permeability and exacerbating BBB disruption. Direct oxidative injury to endothelial cells further compromises BBB integrity, facilitating neuroinflammation and secondary brain injury.\nInflammation is an important host defense response to brain injury, particularly following ICH (\nInflammatory responses after ICH. After ICH, multiple blood components (eg erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets) are released into the brain parenchyma where they can activate microglia, astrocytes, and mast cells by distinct pathways. After activation, microglia upregulate the expression of NLRP3 and TSPO and produce large amounts of pro-inflammatory factors. However, they also produce anti-inflammatory factors such as TGF-b which contributes to brain repair. Astrocytes contribute to the composition of the BBB and are destroyed directly after ICH, leading to BBB disruption. In addition, astrocytes secrete various pro-inflammatory factors that aggravate neuronal injury and brain damage. Pro-inflammatory factors from diverse cell types not only exacerbate BBB disruption and leukocyte infiltration, but also kill neurons directly.\nThe inflammasome is an oligomeric protein complex distributed in the cytoplasm, playing a crucial role in the innate immune response in central nervous system (CNS) diseases.\nSchematic representation of the components of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its simple activation process in ICH. The NLRP3 inflammasome comprises three core components: NLRP3 scaffold (containing N-terminal pyrin/PYD, central NACHT, and C-terminal LRR domains), ASC adaptor, and caspase-1 effector. Danger signal recognition induces NLRP3 oligomerization through NACHT domain interactions. These oligomers recruit ASC via PYD domain binding, triggering ASC speck formation. ASC specks subsequently engage pro-caspase-1 through CARD-CARD interactions, enabling its autocatalytic cleavage into active caspase-1. Mature caspase-1 processes pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β/IL-18 into biologically active forms, driving post-ICH neuroinflammation.\nHowever, it is well known that the activation of the classical NLRP3 inflammasome requires two distinct steps: priming (signal 1) and activation (signal 2).\nDual-Signal activation mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome and pathological effects in ICH. NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires sequential priming (Signal 1) and triggering (Signal 2). Priming involves TLRs/TNFRs-mediated NF-κB activation, upregulating NLRP3 and cytokine precursors (pro-IL-1β/IL-18). Triggering occurs through heme/P2X7R/K\nUnlike the canonical caspase-1-dependent mechanism, the alternative activation pathway of the NLRP3 inflammasome operates via caspase-4/5/11. When Gram-negative bacteria are phagocytosed by immune cells, their membrane components are degraded, releasing lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS directly binds to and activates mouse caspase-11 or human caspase-4/5, leading to the oligomerization and auto-cleavage of these caspases, which subsequently triggers the non-canonical activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.\nThe alternative activation pathway of the NLRP3 inflammasome operates via a single-signal mechanism and has only been identified in human monocytes. In this pathway, TLR4 recognizes extracellular LPS and triggers NLRP3 activation through the caspase-8/FADD/receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) signaling pathway, thereby promoting NLRP3 activation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, this process does not lead to ASC speck formation nor does it induce pyroptosis.\nNLRP3 inflammasomes, along with NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes, are all composed of pattern recognition receptor/sensor proteins, adaptor proteins, and effector enzymes.\nAfter ICH, brain tissue is affected by hematoma, components of red blood cells, and inflammatory factors, leading to an overload of the antioxidant defense system and subsequently triggering OS.\nInteractions Between OS and NLRP3 Inflammasome in ICH: Key Mechanisms and Therapeutic Interventions\nAfter ICH, brain tissue undergoes a series of pathophysiological changes, among which neuroinflammation is an important process.\nNLRP3 Inflammasome-Mediated Neuroinflammation in ICH: Cellular Mechanisms and Feedback Loops\nFollowing ICH, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can exacerbate neuroinflammation. The reduction of endogenous hydrogen sulfide, combined with P2X7 receptor activation, jointly promotes the recruitment and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, further triggering neuroinflammation in ICH.\nAfter ICH, in addition to directly activating the NLRP3 inflammasome to exacerbate neuroinflammation, the NLRP3 inflammasome can further aggravate neuroinflammation by releasing inflammatory factors upon activation. Research has indicated that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome after ICH promotes the polarization of microglia toward the M1 phenotype, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and exacerbating neuroinflammation.\nMicroRNAs are a class of small RNA molecules that play a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. They can form ribonucleoprotein complexes and inhibit the translation of specific mRNAs.\nThe BBB is crucial for maintaining CNS homeostasis, serving as the first line of defense by preventing the entry of foreign pathogens, toxins, and drugs from the bloodstream into the CNS.\nResearch has shown that OS activates the NLRP3 inflammasome through the production of ROS, further exacerbating the inflammatory response.\nNLRP3 Inflammasome as a Signaling Hub Linking OS and Neuroinflammation in ICH: Molecular Crosstalk and Therapeutic Implications\nThe NLRP3 inflammasome is closely associated with secondary injury following ICH and plays a crucial regulatory role between OS and neuroinflammation.
