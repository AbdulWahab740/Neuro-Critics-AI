Obesity also appears to be associated with alterations in taste bud gene expression, affecting taste signaling and inflammatory responses in humans [\nThe present clinical study is a secondary analysis of previously conducted experiments [\nAnthropometric assessment (age, BMI, waist size, hip circumference, fat mass determined by multifrequence impedance, Seca GmbH), blood collection, FP biopsy, and lipid detection thresholds (three‐alternative ascending forced‐choice tests [3‐AFC]) were performed before and 6 months after SG.\nPlasma C‐reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and glycemia levels were assessed by the Biochemical department of the Hôpital Louis Mourier, Colombes, France.\nFP biopsies were conducted before and 6 months after SG, targeting the same area and side of the dorsal tongue.

Two complementary statistical analyses were performed to explore the impact of surgery in each subgroup (pre‐op vs. post‐op) and compare the two subgroups before and after surgery, respectively. Insert: Focus on\nComparison of LA detection thresholds before and after SG highlighted two subgroups, i.e., patients with an improved post‐op sensitivity (i.e., lower LA thresholds than before surgery) and those with unimproved sensitivity. It is unlikely that this dichotomy is due to a surgical bias, as this study has been carried out by the same team of surgeons using the same procedure. Although SG systematically led to significant body weight loss, this corrective action was of a lesser magnitude in unimproved patients than what could explain their higher plasma levels of inflammatory (i.e., CRP, fibrinogen) and dysfunctional metabolic (i.e., insulin, HbA1c) biomarkers. Particularly, a correlation between efficiency of LA detection and weight loss or plasma CRP levels was found. Whether fat taste acuity is the cause or consequence of this phenomenon is not yet known. Similarly, mechanisms responsible for the variability of fat taste sensitivity after SG remain to be fully deciphered.\nWe have previously shown in this cohort that a specific proinflammatory bacterial signature surrounding gustatory papillae characterized LA‐unimproved patients, suggesting that oral inflammatory status might play a significant role in the efficiency of orosensory lipid detection [\nAdditionally, targeted transcriptomic analysis of the fat taste signaling cascade in FP shows that\nIn contrast, overexpressed FP genes in LA‐improved patients might facilitate the orosensory lipid detection by promoting taste bud cell turnover and gustatory innervation. Moreover, among the discriminant genes,\nLimitations should be considered. This comparative study was carried out with a limited sample of patients. Nevertheless, the fact that they served as their own control at least partially counteracted this weakness by reducing possible biases owing to interindividual variability of taste efficiency. Moreover, this study remains descriptive, with correlation not equaling causation.

Two decades after the first identification of long‐chain fatty acid receptors in taste buds [\nA notable observation was made when participants served as their own controls. A study comparing fat taste sensitivity in patients with obesity before and after a sleeve gastrectomy (SG) identified two subgroups: one that showed improved orosensory sensitivity to lipid stimuli post surgery, and the second that remained unimproved [\nThese findings underscore the significant role of gustatory papillae in the variability of post‐SG fat taste sensitivity. Obesity also appears to be associated with alterations in taste bud gene expression, affecting taste signaling and inflammatory responses in humans [\nThe present clinical study is a secondary analysis of previously conducted experiments [\nAnthropometric assessment (age, BMI, waist size, hip circumference, fat mass determined by multifrequence impedance, Seca GmbH), blood collection, FP biopsy, and lipid detection thresholds (three‐alternative ascending forced‐choice tests [3‐AFC]) were performed before and 6 months after SG.\nPlasma C‐reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and glycemia levels were assessed by the Biochemical department of the Hôpital Louis Mourier, Colombes, France.\nFP biopsies were conducted before and 6 months after SG, targeting the same area and side of the dorsal tongue. Patients abstained from oral hygiene on the morning of biopsy to preserve the oral microenvironment. Biopsies took place between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m., after a 2‐h morning fast, in line with a previously established protocol [\nThe orosensory perception of lipids was determined at 9:00 a.m. in fasting patients using the 3‐AFC method with linolenic acid (LA) as the lipid model [\nTotal RNA from FP samples was extracted using a total RNA purification kit from Norgen Biotek Corp. Briefly, FP were homogenized in lysing buffer, and RNA was isolated using column selection. The extracted RNA, treated with RNase‐free DNase I (Norgen Biotek), was then quantified using a Nanodrop spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nRibosomal RNA (rRNA)‐depleted RNA was used for the library preparation with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were paired‐end sequenced (2*76 base pairs) on a NextSeq500 device (Illumina, Inc.), with a read depth of 20 million. Quality control of the raw data was performed using FastQC (version 0.12.0, Babraham Bioinformatics). Then, raw sequencing data were preprocessed using BBMap's BBDuk tool (version 36.20). The BBDuk tool was used for quality trimming, adapter trimming, and filtering of reads. The parameters used were as follows: minimum length of 40, right trim quality of 20, k‐mer trim right, and trimming of the leftmost 11 bases. The “tbo” option was used to trim adapters based on pair overlap detection, and the “tpe” option was used to trim both reads to the same length.

Two complementary statistical analyses were performed to explore the impact of surgery in each subgroup (pre‐op vs. post‐op) and compare the two subgroups before and after surgery, respectively. Insert: Focus on\nComparison of LA detection thresholds before and after SG highlighted two subgroups, i.e., patients with an improved post‐op sensitivity (i.e., lower LA thresholds than before surgery) and those with unimproved sensitivity. It is unlikely that this dichotomy is due to a surgical bias, as this study has been carried out by the same team of surgeons using the same procedure. Although SG systematically led to significant body weight loss, this corrective action was of a lesser magnitude in unimproved patients than what could explain their higher plasma levels of inflammatory (i.e., CRP, fibrinogen) and dysfunctional metabolic (i.e., insulin, HbA1c) biomarkers. Particularly, a correlation between efficiency of LA detection and weight loss or plasma CRP levels was found. Whether fat taste acuity is the cause or consequence of this phenomenon is not yet known. Similarly, mechanisms responsible for the variability of fat taste sensitivity after SG remain to be fully deciphered.\nWe have previously shown in this cohort that a specific proinflammatory bacterial signature surrounding gustatory papillae characterized LA‐unimproved patients, suggesting that oral inflammatory status might play a significant role in the efficiency of orosensory lipid detection [\nAdditionally, targeted transcriptomic analysis of the fat taste signaling cascade in FP shows that\nIn contrast, overexpressed FP genes in LA‐improved patients might facilitate the orosensory lipid detection by promoting taste bud cell turnover and gustatory innervation. Moreover, among the discriminant genes,\nLimitations should be considered. This comparative study was carried out with a limited sample of patients. Nevertheless, the fact that they served as their own control at least partially counteracted this weakness by reducing possible biases owing to interindividual variability of taste efficiency. Moreover, this study remains descriptive, with correlation not equaling causation. However, specific gene signatures that are reliable for fat taste acuity clearly demonstrate two subgroups of patients. Finally, despite a limited number of identified genes, a functional coherence arises that is easily connectable to the variability of orosensory lipid detection, as well as to our previous findings that have already been obtained in this cohort (Figure\nWorking model pooling present and previous disrupting events identified after a sleeve gastrectomy in LA‐unresponsive patients. 1) The downregulation of\nIn conclusion, this study highlights that subtle changes in FP gene expression discriminate LA‐improved from LA‐unimproved patients, suggesting a transcriptomic participation to the variability of fat taste sensitivity after a bariatric surgery and, by extension, in obesity.

The latest OpenMV4 Plus version model can run multiple algorithms for target detection and recognition tasks, including face detection, QR code recognition, and barcode recognition, among other targets. Spence et al. introduced a treadmill-based tracking system that uses Kalman filters to analyze video data, providing real-time estimations of locomotor velocity and position on the treadmill [\nThe stability of tracking results can be affected by multiple factors such as the texture of the animal’s fur, the lighting environment, and the deformation caused by motion. Those issues can be further addressed by introducing deep learning techniques into the object detection tasks, which have made significant progress and shown excellent performance in image processing [\nIn another aspect, we introduced the marker-free method based on a deep learning model, which was trained with an object detection machine learning algorithm, the FOMO MobileV2 network, as a convenient solution to eliminate the need for physical markers (like color blocks or AprilTags).

It is powered by the STM32F765 ARM microcontroller and integrates OmniVsion’s OV7725 VGA CMOS sensor and the L298 motor drive module. OpenMV uses Python 3.0 programming language with embedded image sensor and advanced machine vision features, functioning as a programmable camera module [\nThe OV7725 VGA CMOS sensor acquires images and subsequently employs built-in image processing algorithms. This enables the system to compute the coordinates of the central point of target images and the field of view, which is commonly used in the field of computer vision and imaging processing.

Then, the result is used for controlling motor speed and direction (\nBy deploying OpenMV as an artificial vision system for position detection, it analyses the information from the camera and controls the motor’s direction and speed. The motor’s speed and direction are dynamically adjusted based on the X-axis distance of the center position between the color block and the OpenMV camera’s field of view, ensuring that the animal remains stably positioned on the treadmill. The animal’s position is always focused on the center of the behavioral camera’s field of view, facilitating the sustained and stable capture of images for analysis of the animal’s gait and behavior. The detailed control method is described as follows.\nThe center coordinates of the field of view are calculated as follows:\nThe center coordinates of the target object are calculated as follows:\nHere,\nThen, we obtain the deviation value between the center of mass of the target object and the center of the image data as follows:\nThe adopted algorithms for motor direction control and speed adjustment are relatively simple. The motor’s rotational direction is opposite to the sign of the relative displacement. Therefore, when the object is in motion, the motor will rotate in the opposite direction. The motor’s rotational speed has a linear relationship with the absolute value of the displacement, and the speed increases as the absolute value of the displacement increases. The classical proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control method was used to dynamically adjust values for the speed and direction of the treadmill based on the deviation value as follows [\nHere,\nThe adjustment amount determines the movement direction and speed of the treadmill and is converted into control signal to adjust the moving object to the preset position of the treadmill as follows:\nDue to the different resistances of the belts of treadmills, in practice, the user needs to adjust the PID parameters and test the smoothness of the motor’s rotation.\nWe utilized an H-bridge DC motor driver module with high power output capacity to drive the motor’s rotation direction and speed. The control principle for the DC motor is as follows: A1.A2 = 0.0 for the brake; A1.A2 = 1.0 for forward rotation; A1.A2 = 0.1 for reverse rotation. PWM is used as the input signal to drive the motor under the control of a 15 K Hz square wave for motor speed regulation A 5 V supply power is provided to the OpenMV module, with a common ground connection for the driver board and the OpenMV control module (\nThe system control program is divided into three parts, labeled as ‘motor’, ‘pid’ and ‘main’, separately. Among them, ‘motor’ is used to control the motor’s forward and reverse rotation as well as speed control. The ‘pid’ part is used for PID control of the PWM signal. The ‘main’ part serves as the main program that calls ‘motor’ and ‘pid’, which is used for object recognition, extraction of pixel center positions, and calculation of center point offset displacement.\nThe system uses a consistent framework for detecting different types of targets, such as colored markers, AprilTags, or pre-trained models. For different types of target detection, similar methods are employed with the specific algorithm adjusted depending on the type of target.\nTo track rats directly from their body features, we adopted the FOMO MobileNetV2 network for the training of our marker-free object detection model. FOMO (Fast Object Detection and Tracking) uses MobileNetV2 as a backbone for its lightweight object detection of mobile devices and resource-constrained environments [\nLong Evans rats were used as testing subjects. Each rat had a uniquely trained model to minimize the influence of variable environmental and body feature factors on model performance. We standardized all pertinent environmental factors, including illumination, camera angle, and field of view, to ensure consistency between the training and real-world environments. For models deployed within a polycarbonate enclosure, testing indicated that black backgrounds yielded optimal performance; consequently, a black background was selected for these conditions.\nThe model was trained using Edge Impulse, a platform optimized for machine learning models tailored for embedded systems and edge devices. The full project is publicly available at\nBy evaluating the training process and the classification performance, the neural network demonstrated excellent performance by the end of the training. It effectively minimizes both training and validation loss while achieving high precision, recall, and F1 scores. The steady alignment of training and validation metrics suggests the model generalizes well without overfitting, making it a robust and reliable model for the marker-free object detecting task.\nMeanwhile, the training performance of this neural network, based on the provided precision, recall, and F1 score values, indicates the model achieved excellent performance with near-perfect metrics. The training performance of this neural network demonstrated remarkable classification ability. With a precision of 1.00, the model indicates that there were no false positives after epoch 1. The recall ranges from 0.98 to 1.00, demonstrating the model’s capability to identify nearly all relevant instances by epoch 14, and an F1 score between 0.99 and 1.00 reflects an almost perfect balance between precision and recall. These results suggest that the model has effectively learned the task and generalized well to the validation data.\nAfter training, we analyzed the classification performance using validation results from both the full-precision (float32) and quantized (int8) models. The float32 model achieved perfect classification (100% precision, recall, and F1 score) for both classes. In contrast, the quantized int8 model exhibited slightly lower recall (95.24%), reflecting a minor misclassification, while maintaining perfect precision and a high F1 score (97.6%) for the “Rat” class (\nThis may be attributed to FOMO’s design, which prioritizes centroids for efficient object detection rather than complete bounding boxes. When the object spans multiple grid cells but the network is overly focused on predicting centroids, it may “collapse” the detection to a single grid cell (the centroid), even when the object is recognized accurately. This issue can further be mitigated by increasing grid resolution to better represent objects that span multiple cells and adjusting the loss function to balance centroid predictions with spatial consistency across the object’s extent. This ensures that the training data include diverse object sizes and positions to teach the model to predict beyond just centroids. However, this issue reflects a trade-off in lightweight models like FOMO, where efficiency and simplicity may occasionally come at the cost of spatial precision. The detailed parameters of the model’s performance for object detection (including accuracy, precision, and F1 score) are summarized in\nWe evaluated the performance of this model in real-world tasks. In practical applications, the movement of animals involves changes in gait and dynamic adjustments of body posture and will cause significant deformation; thus, tracking errors caused by deformation are difficult to avoid.\nIn several cases where label detection failed due to environmental lighting (indicated as white arrow in\nIn this paper, we propose a series of intelligent upgrades for animal treadmills by leveraging our existing mechanical structures. These upgrades are compatible with traditional gait research paradigms. Notably, recent advancements in human rehabilitation have introduced an omnidirectional treadmill that allows for dynamic changes in speed and direction guided by virtual reality, facilitating more complex locomotor tasks [\nWe used OpenMV Cam as an embedded vision platform and one H-bridge driver board to achieve target recognition and positioning. It is a simple and cost-effective solution to modify our existing laboratory treadmill with a total cost of less than USD 150. It is important to note that the overall design of this intelligent treadmill system uses DC motors. Due to the significant electromagnetic noise generated by DC motors, in experiments requiring electrophysiological data collection, there might be substantial noise interference. Therefore, replacing it with a brushless servo motor would be a better choice for such experiments.\nIn our study, the PID parameters were empirically tuned using iterative testing in a controlled environment. The tuning process aimed to balance responsiveness (reducing latency in speed adaptation) with smoothness (avoiding oscillations that could affect animal behavior). In future work, we plan to implement adaptive or model-based control methods and quantitatively evaluate PID tuning under varying gait dynamics and environmental conditions.\nFinally, latency remains an inherent limitation in embedded systems, particularly under constrained computational resources. As emphasized throughout this work, our primary goal is to provide a cost-effective, open, and modular platform that can be adopted by the research community to retrofit traditional treadmills with modern control capabilities using off-the-shelf embedded components. Despite hardware limitations, the current implementation demonstrates viable real-time performance, with inference latency measured at approximately 87 ms per frame. Nonetheless, future deployment on more powerful embedded platforms—such as Cortex-M7, Cortex-A, ARC, or ESP32-S3—could help further reduce latency and enhance the responsiveness of the system in more demanding experimental conditions.\nIn this study, we provided adaptive treadmills and control methods based on real-time computer vision and demonstrated the capabilities of the FOMO MobileNetV2 model for real-time object detection in resource-constrained environments. We ensured the reliability of the model in real-world applications by integrating the model into OpenMV4 Cam H7 Plus and optimizing the model so that it can run efficiently on embedded systems while maintaining high accuracy.", "content_for_embedding": "Treadmills are commonly used for investigating rodent gait and behavior, with extensive applications in neuroscience, rehabilitation medicine, and exercise biology [\nWith the rapid advancement of automation and computer vision powered by deep learning [\nIn this paper, we use an embedded vision platform (OpenMV) that can significantly reduce system design complexity and further ensure the stability of the system. The latest OpenMV4 Plus version model can run multiple algorithms for target detection and recognition tasks, including face detection, QR code recognition, and barcode recognition, among other targets. Spence et al. introduced a treadmill-based tracking system that uses Kalman filters to analyze video data, providing real-time estimations of locomotor velocity and position on the treadmill [\nThe stability of tracking results can be affected by multiple factors such as the texture of the animal’s fur, the lighting environment, and the deformation caused by motion. Those issues can be further addressed by introducing deep learning techniques into the object detection tasks, which have made significant progress and shown excellent performance in image processing [\nIn another aspect, we introduced the marker-free method based on a deep learning model, which was trained with an object detection machine learning algorithm, the FOMO MobileV2 network, as a convenient solution to eliminate the need for physical markers (like color blocks or AprilTags). Instead, it relies on the natural features of the animal for real-time object detection and tracking. The training performance of this neural network demonstrates excellent classification ability in dynamic environments where the animal is constantly changing position and posture on the treadmill.\nThe mechanical part of the treadmill consists of the drive motor, the conveyor wheels, and the support frame. In our design, the motor and mechanical parts are taken from a commercial animal platform (TREADMILL SIMPLEX II: Exer3/6 COLUMBUS INSTRUMENT). The control panel was removed, leaving the motor and conveyor wheels as well as the support frame. Then, the power supply, controller, and drives were added and integrated into a new automation system. The design shows a universal adaptability, allowing researches to modify their existing treadmill for intelligent applications.\nThe OpenMV camera module is used as a motor driver, and it features open-source, cost-effective, and notably potent machine vision support. It is powered by the STM32F765 ARM microcontroller and integrates OmniVsion’s OV7725 VGA CMOS sensor and the L298 motor drive module.

In addition, the combined treatment of DAP and TAK-242 could more significantly increase the levels of BDNF and VEGF (\nThe release of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the model group increased significantly (\nResults of Western blot showed that DAP can significantly reduce expressions of TLR4, MyD88 and P-NF-κB P65, while the addition of TAK-242 under DAP-H treatment could further reduce their expressions. Furthermore, DAP can significantly increase expressions of Bcl-2, reduce expressions of Bax and Cleaved Caspase-3 (\nBV2 cells were cultured with D-gal at concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 μg/mL for 24 h. When the concentration of D-gal was 30 μg/mL, the cell viability decreased to 53.49%, and the cell viability was 43.25% when the concentration was 40 μg/mL. Therefore, we chose D-gal at 30 μg/mL for the subsequent experiments (\nCompared with the control group, model group of pro-inflammatory factors levels increased significantly.

In addition, when treated with 600 μg/mLDAP and then treated with 1 μmol/L TAK-24, the expressions of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were further decreased (\nCompared to the control group, ROS level in the model group increased significantly. Then, the ROS level decreased significantly after DAP treatment (\nThe expressions of TLR4, MyD88, P-NF-κB P65, Bax and Cleaved Caspase-3 in the model group significantly increased, while the protein expression of Bcl-2 significantly decreased. However, after DAP treatment, the expressions of TLR4, MyD88 and P-NF-κB P65 can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, the addition of TAK-242 under DAP-H treatment can further reduce their expression (\nAging is closely related to brain-related diseases. As people age, the functions of the human brain gradually show a declining trend, which in turn leads to a significant increase in the risk of brain diseases. According to statistics, the rates of brain-related chronic diseases such as stroke, cerebral ischemia, AD and PD have gradually increased, and there is a trend of younger onset age [\nThis study adopted the Morris water maze experiment evaluation of cognitive function in mice [\nChronic inflammation and oxidative stress are the key factors leading to aging [\nTLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway is a classic inflammation-related pathway and plays an important role in the mediation of inflammation [\nAlthough studies have shown that DAP can prevent brain damage caused by D-gal, some limitations need to be noted. Firstly, we only used D-gal to induce specific animal and cellular aging models, which is not applicable to all aging models. Moreover, the number of experimental animals and the experimental period are limited, and it cannot simulate natural human aging. In addition, this study mainly focuses on the short-term gavage therapeutic effect of DAP, and its long-term therapeutic effect still needs further exploration. Moreover, whether other administration routes of DAP are effective still requires further research. Future research should address these limitations to gain a deeper understanding of the brain-protective effect of DAP.\nTo sum up, our study found that DAP can inhibit the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway to lower the levels of inflammatory factors and inhibit oxidative stress, thus improving the brain injury induced by D-gal. The results indicate that DAP has good potential in the prevention and treatment of brain injury caused by aging.", "topic": "Neuroanatomy"}

It remains unclear when pathogenic variants causing FCD type 2 occur during development, and how they affect mutant compared to nonmutant cells. In this study, single-cell transcriptomics combined with cell-type-resolved genotyping of somatic variants reveal that FCD type 2 affects mainly neurectoderm-derived cortical cells. Mutant neurons in the mosaic cortical lesions show upregulation of pathways related to metabolism and cell growth, which are downregulated in nonmutant neurons. We further identified changes in microglial activation, synaptic homeostasis, and neuronal connectivity potentially contributing to epileptogenesis.\nWhile it is widely accepted that somatic variants that activate the PI3K-mTOR pathway are a major cause of drug-resistant focal epilepsy, typically associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type 2, understanding the mechanism of epileptogenesis requires identifying genotype-associated changes at the single-cell level, which is technically challenging with existing methods.

GO-TEN and ResolveOME analyses confirmed that pathogenic variant-carrying cells have well-differentiated neuronal or glial identities, with enrichment of variants in cells of the neuroectodermal lineage, pointing to cortical neural progenitors as possible loci of somatic mutation. Within FCD type 2 lesions, we identified upregulation of PI3K-mTOR signaling and related pathways in variant-carrying neurons, downregulation of these pathways in non-variant-carrying neurons, as well as associated changes in microglial activation, cellular metabolism, synaptic homeostasis, and neuronal connectivity, all potentially contributing to epileptogenesis.

These results support prior reports of inflammation in FCD2 tissue (\nGenotype-informed DGE and GSEA identified variant-specific alterations in cellular metabolism, biosynthesis, and growth-related pathways common to multiple cell types in FCD2. While PI3K-mTOR and related pathways were globally downregulated in neurons in FCD2 compared to controls overall, variant-carrying neurons in FCD2 tissue showed the expected upregulation of these pathways compared to non-variant-carrying counterparts. This is indicative of a complex dynamic where cells in the affected mosaic tissue all exhibit dysregulated signaling and dysfunction irrespective of their genotype, and helps resolve the paradox of why FCD2 lesions show hypometabolism on clinical PET imaging (\nInterrogation of epilepsy-associated pathways and gene lists, together with CellChat analysis, strongly suggested global alterations in synapse formation and function and cell–cell connectivity in FCD2, with a global decrease in the stability of neuronal connectivity in FCD2 compared to control brains, which is even more evident in variant-carrying compared to non-variant-carrying cells. We found this dysfunction to be particularly significant between excitatory neurons and interneurons, potentially contributing to hyperexcitability.

Co-occurrence of somatic variants in excitatory and inhibitory neurons confirms prior reports of variant-carrying interneurons in FCD2 (\nOur study is limited by the low sensitivity of GO-TEN, which in its current form can genotype ~21% of the sequenced cells in the high-sensitivity mode, with sensitivity that may be even lower depending on gene expression levels. This drawback leads to reduced sensitivity of analyses that aim at detecting genotype-associated gene expression changes. A second limitation is the technically demanding nature of the GO-TEN technology that results in incomplete genotyping of all the available alleles. Finally, our regression analysis reveals that certain cell types are preferentially genotyped for a given gene, perhaps due to differential isoform usage although future studies are needed to investigate this hypothesis. Although ResolveOME addresses some of these limitations by performing genotyping on the amplified DNA and by genotyping both alleles, it is significantly more expensive and has lower throughput.\nDespite these limitations, our study highlights the importance of investigating both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of somatic variants in mosaic FCD2, showing that both aspects are likely involved in disease pathophysiology.

While this analysis is subject to differential sampling, they may indicate gliosis and microglial activation in the FCD2-associated dysplastic cortex, which is supported by DGE and GSEA. These results support prior reports of inflammation in FCD2 tissue (\nGenotype-informed DGE and GSEA identified variant-specific alterations in cellular metabolism, biosynthesis, and growth-related pathways common to multiple cell types in FCD2. While PI3K-mTOR and related pathways were globally downregulated in neurons in FCD2 compared to controls overall, variant-carrying neurons in FCD2 tissue showed the expected upregulation of these pathways compared to non-variant-carrying counterparts. This is indicative of a complex dynamic where cells in the affected mosaic tissue all exhibit dysregulated signaling and dysfunction irrespective of their genotype, and helps resolve the paradox of why FCD2 lesions show hypometabolism on clinical PET imaging (\nInterrogation of epilepsy-associated pathways and gene lists, together with CellChat analysis, strongly suggested global alterations in synapse formation and function and cell–cell connectivity in FCD2, with a global decrease in the stability of neuronal connectivity in FCD2 compared to control brains, which is even more evident in variant-carrying compared to non-variant-carrying cells. We found this dysfunction to be particularly significant between excitatory neurons and interneurons, potentially contributing to hyperexcitability. Although functional studies are needed to definitively test these hypotheses, our data suggest that mosaic variants lead to epilepsy via broad changes in neuronal circuits rather than cell-autonomous hyperexcitability alone.\nGO-TEN and ResolveOME cell-type-informed genotyping of\nThe focal nature of cortical findings in FCD2 suggests a simple model that the FCD2-associated variants first arise in dorsal forebrain progenitors that produce radially migrating neurons and glial cells. Co-occurrence of somatic variants in excitatory and inhibitory neurons confirms prior reports of variant-carrying interneurons in FCD2 (\nOur study is limited by the low sensitivity of GO-TEN, which in its current form can genotype ~21% of the sequenced cells in the high-sensitivity mode, with sensitivity that may be even lower depending on gene expression levels. This drawback leads to reduced sensitivity of analyses that aim at detecting genotype-associated gene expression changes. A second limitation is the technically demanding nature of the GO-TEN technology that results in incomplete genotyping of all the available alleles. Finally, our regression analysis reveals that certain cell types are preferentially genotyped for a given gene, perhaps due to differential isoform usage although future studies are needed to investigate this hypothesis. Although ResolveOME addresses some of these limitations by performing genotyping on the amplified DNA and by genotyping both alleles, it is significantly more expensive and has lower throughput.\nDespite these limitations, our study highlights the importance of investigating both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of somatic variants in mosaic FCD2, showing that both aspects are likely involved in disease pathophysiology.

Their metal content is influenced by environmental factors (e.g., industrial areas, mining sites) and individual factors (e.g., maternal diet, early nutrition, passive smoking). The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxic metal content in deciduous teeth and to identify factors contributing to its accumulation, as well as possible health implications. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and following the PICO framework. Quality assessment was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for quasi-experimental studies. The literature search was carried out in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using the following keywords: deciduous, milk, primary, decidua, teeth, dentition, heavy metal, toxic metals. A total of 134 articles were initially identified, with 95 remaining after duplicate removal. After screening, 75 articles were excluded: 71 did not meet the inclusion criteria, 3 were not available in English, and 1 lacked full-text access. Ultimately, 20 studies were included in the review. Toxic metal concentrations were determined using various analytical techniques, mainly inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Higher levels of metals, especially lead, were observed in the teeth of children residing in industrial areas, near mines, or in regions affected by armed conflict. Although two out of five studies indicated a possible link between fathers’ smoking habits and elevated lead concentrations, no definitive relationship was established between secondhand smoke exposure and the levels of lead and cadmium found in dental tissue. Similarly, no definitive relationship was identified between mercury and lead content and the prevalence of autism. However, lower manganese levels were associated with the presence of autistic traits, weaker verbal performance, and reduced memory capacity. In conclusion, deciduous teeth represent a valuable biological material for assessing chronic prenatal and early postnatal exposure to toxic metals, which may serve as a starting point for further research into diseases of unknown etiology, such as autism, and in the future may have clinical significance in their prevention and treatment.

The exclusion of non-English publications is another limitation, although it helped ensure full comprehension and accurate analysis of included studies. To improve future research, it is strongly recommended to adopt standardized protocols for sample preparation, metal quantification, and data reporting. Studies should aim to include large, well-characterized cohorts and report both relative and absolute concentrations of metals. Consistent testing and reporting standards would greatly enhance the comparability and reliability of findings across studies. In terms of biological mechanisms, several heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium are known neurotoxicants that can interfere with neurotransmitter systems, oxidative stress pathways, and calcium-dependent signaling during critical periods of brain development. For example, lead can disrupt synapse formation and plasticity, contributing to cognitive deficits and behavioral problems. Cadmium has been associated with impaired lung development and function through mechanisms involving inflammation and oxidative damage. These pathways underscore the relevance of assessing metal accumulation in deciduous teeth as an early indicator of potential developmental risks. Future research could benefit from incorporating advanced statistical approaches such as Monte Carlo simulations to better estimate individual and population-level risk. These tools allow for the integration of variability and uncertainty across multiple exposure factors, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments based on toxic metal concentrations in primary teeth.\nIn conclusion, deciduous teeth can be used as a reliable and non-invasive biological matrix reflecting chronic exposure to toxic metals during both the prenatal and early postnatal periods. Their mineralized structure allows for the long-term retention of toxic metals, providing a valuable archive of environmental exposure during critical stages of development. The results of this review highlight the significant influence of environmental and lifestyle-related factors, such as industrial pollution and proximity to mining areas, on the accumulation of toxic metals in deciduous teeth. While associations with specific health outcomes, including autism, remain inconclusive, observed correlations with neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those linked to manganese deficiency, underscore the need for further research.

Although transcriptional regulators of neurotransmitter identity are known, it remains unclear how synaptic features are patterned among neuronal subtypes. In the auditory system, glutamatergic synaptic properties vary across three spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) subtypes that collectively encode sound. Here, we demonstrate that Maf transcription factors combinatorially shape synaptic properties in SGNs. SGN subtypes express different ratios of c-Maf and Mafb, which act redundantly to impart subtype identities and individually to shape subtype-appropriate gene expression programs. On their own,\nBastille and colleagues demonstrate that two closely related transcription factors, c-Maf and Mafb, have both redundant and independent effects on the diversification and functional differentiation of peripheral auditory neurons. Their data suggest that varying combinations of c-Maf and Mafb generate nuanced differences in synaptic structure and function.", "full_text": "Robust and accurate synaptic transmission is essential for perception and behavior. Complex sensory information is relayed by neuronal subpopulations that each encode distinct features of incoming stimuli. To this end, sensory neuron synapses differ widely in their composition, size, and morphology, thereby enabling subtle differences in their signaling properties.\nIn the auditory system, sound information is communicated via ribbon synapses that relay signals from mechanosensitive hair cells to spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), which connect the cochlea to the brain.\nWith known roles in terminal differentiation and synaptic development in other systems,\nTo evaluate the role of c-Maf and Mafb in the establishment of SGN peripheral synaptic properties, we analyzed anatomical and functional phenotypes as well as gene expression changes in single and double cKO mice and of hearing in human patients. Our results suggest that varying levels of these closely related TFs execute both shared and subtype-appropriate programs of gene expression to both establish and fine-tune neuronal properties needed for robust yet diverse responses to sound.\nGiven its function in other neurons, we hypothesized that c-Maf influences SGN synaptic properties and auditory function. To test this idea, we generated\nIn contrast to c-Maf\nAfferent synapses appeared abnormal in cDKO cochleae, with irregular aggregates of small and large synaptic puncta, that occasionally lacked opposing presynaptic ribbons (\nTo understand the relative contributions of c-Maf and Mafb to synapse development, we examined their expression patterns in developing and mature SGNs. Reanalysis of published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets showed increased abundance of\nFurther analysis demonstrated that c-Maf and Mafb are also expressed differentially across SGN subtypes during synaptogenesis, which occurs during the first two postnatal weeks of mouse life.\nThe presence of different combinations of c-Maf and Mafb in each SGN subtype suggested that Maf factors work together to establish different gene expression programs in Ia, Ib, and Ic SGNs. We therefore used scRNA-seq to compare SGN transcriptomes from\nConsistent with their differential expression,\nTo assess gene expression changes across SGN subtypes, we measured how well mutant subtype classes aligned with the assigned identity, as indicated by a prediction score from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates high certainty that the cell was correctly classified. When 25% of the control SGNs were withheld and then projected onto the remaining 75%, most of the cells in each class had prediction scores close to 1 (\nBioinformatic analysis demonstrated that c-Maf and Mafb mostly regulate different sets of synapse-related genes. By comparing pooled control to pooled mutant SGNs in each dataset, we defined 3,877 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in c-Maf\nTo further assess differential effects for c-Maf and Mafb across subtypes, we calculated the relative log fold change for all c-Maf DEGs and all Mafb DEGs in each SGN subtype, with 1 assigned to the subtype with the highest fold change. Consistent with the high c-Maf:Mafb ratio in Ia SGNs, more genes showed the biggest changes in Ia SGNs upon loss of c-Maf (59% of all c-Maf DEGs) than upon loss of Mafb (35% of all Mafb DEGs) (\nAlthough c-Maf and Mafb largely regulate different sets of genes, the severity of the cDKO phenotype emphasized the likelihood of substantial redundancy. To identify the combined effects of Maf factors on SGN gene expression, we collected SGN transcriptomes from P30–35 cDKO (\nComputational evaluation of identities by canonical correlation analysis predicted that most cDKO cells were Ic SGNs (\nIn addition to the dramatic change in identity, the nature of gene expression changes in cDKO SGNs underscored the combined contributions of c-Maf and Mafb to programs of synaptic gene expression. Comparison of control and cDKO SGNs identified 3,011 DEGs, with 1,973 upregulated DEGs and 1,038 downregulated DEGs. All top 10 GOCC terms were synaptic (\nTo test how different combinations of c-Maf and Mafb shape gene expression\nTo investigate the relative contributions of c-Maf and Mafb, we examined Calb2 levels in P42–65 animals harboring different numbers of genomic copies of each factor (wild type, 2 copies; heterozygotes, 1 copy; and homozygotes, 0 copies). Consistent with the transcriptomic results, Calb2 immunostaining revealed no appreciable difference in Mafb\nAnalysis of littermates carrying various combinations of c-Maf and Mafb underscored the sensitivity of Calb2 to Maf activity. For example, although\nWithin the complete set of Maf-dependent genes, many that depend mainly on c-Maf (green) are normally highly expressed in Ia SGNs, whereas Mafb-regulated genes (pink) are highly expressed in Ib and Ic SGNs (\nTo evaluate the broader impact of the combined effects of c-Maf and Mafb, we asked how changes to the Maf code might impact peripheral synapses and auditory function. To compare the relative and combined contributions of these two TFs rigorously, we quantified features of CtBP2/Ribeye and GluA2 puncta in cochleae from P42–65 littermates that retained one copy of\nConsistent with their complex effects on synaptic gene expression, we observed both independent and overlapping effects on cochlear synapses in mice retaining only one copy of\nOne possibility is that c-Maf and Mafb constrain variability in GluA2 abundance, with each factor pushing abundance in an opposite direction. Consistent with the appearance of both very small and very large puncta, the distribution of GluA2 volumes in cDKO animals had a larger interquartile range than in controls (\nAnother striking feature of the cDKO phenotype is the abnormal distribution of synaptic puncta along the bottom of the hair cell. Qualitatively, the puncta appeared to be less evenly spread out, clustering toward the center of the IHC’s basal pole (\nTo examine how the unique effects of c-Maf and Mafb on synaptic gene expression and structure might impact responses to sound, we recorded pure-tone ABRs from P42–65 control (\nThe exacerbated effects on threshold and P1 amplitudes in cDKO animals suggest that\nIn further support of a synergistic action of c-Maf and Mafb, auditory responses were worse in cDKO animals than in Mafb\nGiven the complex effects in mice, we wondered how changes to the Maf code might affect hearing in humans. Heterozygous mutations in\nExome sequencing revealed a homozygous missense variant, c.884A>G p.(Lys295Arg), in\nTogether, these results support a model whereby different ratios of c-Maf and Mafb establish subtype-specific gene expression across SGNs (\nSGNs exhibit physiological, molecular, and synaptic differences that allow them to collectively capture a rich array of sounds. Here, we show that SGN subtypes express different levels of two related TFs that cooperate to shape identity and synaptic differentiation. We propose that by deploying both overlapping and unique effects on gene expression, c-Maf and Mafb establish gene expression programs that diversify SGN properties required for hearing (\nConsistent with their similar DNA-binding domains, c-Maf and Mafb work redundantly to control expression of genes needed for subtype diversification and synaptic differentiation. The lack of diversification observed upon loss of both c-Maf and Mafb contrasts with what occurs in\nOne way that identity may be tied to the synapse is through the relative levels of c-Maf and Mafb. Although the importance of combinatorial transcriptional codes is well established,\nThere are several mechanisms by which c-Maf and Mafb could achieve both robustness and flexibility. Toward robustness, c-Maf and Mafb may bind with similar affinities to the same sequences, regardless of their expression level. Essential synaptic genes likely fall into this category. On the other hand, flexibility may come from differences in binding affinity of c-Maf and Mafb to certain target sequences. Indeed, Sox9 binds differently to regulatory sequences for dose-dependent genes than for genes that are more tolerant to changes in Sox9 levels.\nThe potential importance of protein-protein interactions is underscored by our discovery of a homozygous\nThe overlapping but distinct contributions of c-Maf and Mafb to SGN identity and differentiation exemplify how small adjustments in TF expression levels and distributions can fine-tune synaptic properties and thus create complexity across evolution. Indeed, the co-option of combinations of TFs generates novel wing pigmentation patterns in butterflies and body plans among insects.\nWhile our work suggests one way that related TFs may combine to shape synaptic properties across neuronal subtypes, several limitations should be noted. Foremost, direct transcriptional targets of c-Maf and Mafb need to be identified, followed by analysis of how each family member binds to relevant enhancers and induces subtype-appropriate programs of gene expression. It will also be important to identify target genes responsible for the peripheral synaptic defects and how those defects contribute to the ABR phenotypes, including analysis of the biophysical properties of individual synapses. Since changes to wave 1 amplitude and latency could be caused by anything that influences synchronous firing of SGNs, alterations to the axon initial segment should also be considered. It remains unclear whether Maf factors affect other synapses, including SGN synapses in the brainstem and synapses between OHCs and type II SGNs in the cochlea. Furthermore, given our focus on adult (P30–40) animals, we cannot say how c-Maf and Mafb act across development and aging or after acoustic trauma. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of how c-Maf and Mafb and their target genes build synapses with different properties in SGNs will inform how synapse heterogeneity arises in other neuron types.\nRequests for further information and resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Lisa Goodrich (\nThis study did not generate any new unique reagents.\nRaw scRNA-seq data generated in this study, processed gene expression matrices, and related metadata have been deposited at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository.

These data were not part of a clinical trial.\nAnimals were anesthetized via isoflurane exposure in an open-drop chamber and subsequently perfused with cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1X PBS. Both temporal bones were dissected and cold 4% PFA was perfused through the oval window with a syringe. For wholemount immunohistochemistry, cochleae were drop-fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature for 30 minutes and transferred to 10% EDTA overnight at 4C. These fixation and decalcification times and conditions differed from previous analyses in Mafb\nAll tissues were imaged using a Leica SP8 point-scanning confocal microscope with HyD and photomultiplier tube (PMT) detectors. For wholemount cochleae, frequency maps were generated by taking 10X stacks of the cochlear turns and using the Measure_Line ImageJ plugin available through the Histology Core at Mass Eye and Ear (Boston, MA). Synaptic puncta were then captured using HyD detectors while hair cells were captured using PMT detectors using a 63x oil-immersion objective (voxel size= 0.901 × 0.901 × 0.299um\nMice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Meloxicam (1 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally for analgesia. Animals were placed on a 37°C heating pad (ATC1000, World Precision Instruments) and additional ketamine (30–40 mg/kg) was administered as needed to maintain the anesthetic plane throughout the procedure. ABRs and DPOAEs were measured using a custom acoustic system (Eaton-Peabody Laboratories, Massachusetts Eye and Ear) in an electrically shielded and sound attenuating chamber. All recordings were performed with the researcher blinded to genotype.\nAuditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded from three subcutaneous needle electrodes: a recording electrode caudal to the pinna, a reference electrode at the vertex, and a ground electrode by the tail. ABR stimuli were presented from 20 to 90 dB SPL in 5 dB steps at 8, 16, 32, and 45 kHz. Each stimulus was presented as a 5-ms tone-pip at a rate of 31/s, with a 0.5 ms rise-fall time and alternating polarities. Responses were amplified 10,000x, filtered with a 0.3–3 kHz passband (P511, Grass), and averaged 512 times. Recordings with peak to peak amplitudes exceeding 15 μV were rejected as artifacts.\nDistortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were recorded from a probe-tube microphone aligned above the ear canal. In-ear calibrations were performed using the Cochlear Function Test Suite (v 2.36, Massachusetts Eye and Ear) prior to reach recording. DPOAE stimuli were presented at primary tones f1 and f2, where f2 varied from 5.6 to 32 kHz in half-octave steps. Primary tones were presented at frequency ratios of f2/f1 = 1.2 and level differences of L1 = L2 + 10. Levels of primary tone f2 were incremented in 10 dB steps from 0 to 70 dB SPL.\nTemporal bones were extracted, and the spiral ganglion was microdissected from the cochlea in cold Leibovitz L-15 buffer. Cells were then treated with collagenase type IV followed by papain for 25 minutes each at 37°C. The cells were passed through ovomucoid as recommended for the Papain Dissociation System and then passed through a 40 μm cell strainer. Dissociated cells were resuspended in cold EBSS. Cell concentration was estimated using a hemocytometer. Cells were then loaded into a single cell chip from 10x Genomics following manufacturer’s recommendations. Datasets were processed with the Chromium single-cell 3’ library and gel bead kit v2.0. cDNA libraries were generated according to the manufacturer’s directions. The final libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq SP.\nAll statistical analysis was done in Python. Normality of each distribution was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. If both groups showed a normal distribution, a parametric t-Test or ANOVA was used. Otherwise, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney Rank Sum or Kruskal-Wallis Test was applied. P1 Amplitudes were fit to a regression curve and compared statistically with ANOVA in a multiple regression analysis. The following equations were used: P1Amplitude~Level\nABR thresholds, amplitudes, and latencies were analyzed using ABR Peak Analysis software (v.1.1.1.9; Massachusetts Eye and Ear). ABR threshold was defined as the lowest stimulus level at which wave 1 could be identified by visual inspection.\nThe distortion products at 2f1-f2 were temporally and spectrally averaged. Iso-response contours were generated by the Cochlear Function Test Suite software for various criterion response amplitudes. DPOAE threshold was defined as the f1 level required to produce a DPOAE of 5 dB SPL.\nPre- and post-synaptic puncta and cells were reconstructed semi-automatically using the “Surfaces” function in Imaris. A local contrast-background subtraction algorithm was applied to all z-stacks for thresholding. All reconstructions were created and reviewed with the researcher blinded to genotype. Inaccuracies in automatic segmentation were corrected manually. Reconstructions located outside the volume of hair cells were excluded from analysis. Image-based coordinates of reconstructed puncta were transformed into hair cell-centric coordinates using the “Reference Frames” function in Imaris. Each hair cell-centric coordinate system was defined with the following three planes: an XZ plane bisecting the hair cell through its plane of symmetry, a YZ plane bisecting the nucleus through the plane parallel to the tilt of the hair cell, and an XY plane tangential to the basolateral pole of the hair cell. Metrics regarding the size and localization of reconstructed pre- and postsynaptic puncta and cells were exported into Excel for further analysis. Volume measurements were normalized by the median of the control values within each stain batch. For quantification of c-Maf and Mafb stains, 3D reconstructions were made for each SGN cell body in Imaris similar as above using the HuD channel that marked all SGN cell bodies. Metrics regarding fluorescence intensity were exported into Excel for further analysis.\nFor\nFor SGNs from each genotype, Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed alongside regression modeling to quantify the association between normalized fluorescence levels for Calb2 and c-Maf.

The library was normalized by fitting the gene counts to a regularized binomial regression function implemented by the scTransform package for Seurat using all default settings and regression on percent mitochondrial reads.\nClustering was performed using the Seurat FindClusters command using 30 principle components. SGN clusters were identified and subsetted out by the expression of neuronal genes such as Tubb3 and Nefh. Utilizing the RNA assay, subsetted SGNs were normalized and subclustered using similar parameters as above. Subtypes of SGNs were identified by the expression of subtype specific markers previously identified (\nDifferential expression was tested using the FindAllMarkers command on the SCT assay and probing for significantly regulated genes between control and mutant SGNs from each genotype. The differential expression of cDKO genes was analyzed by subtype in each single cKO dataset. Genes were considered differentially expressed in mutant SGNs if they were significantly changed (\nKnockout datasets were projected onto control datasets as described previously for dataset integration.\nWritten informed consent was provided from participating individuals in an Iranian family who were ascertained as part of a large ethnically diverse hereditary hearing loss study. Pure-tone audiograms and medical information were collected from the proband at the age of 25 years, as well as his affected and unaffected siblings. Additional syndromic features were excluded. The proband underwent complete ear, nose, and throat examination, including binocular ear microscopy and inspection of the external ear. Routine pure-tone audiometry measured hearing thresholds at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz according to current standards. Air- and bone-conduction thresholds were measured and severity of hearing loss was determined by averaging pure-tone thresholds over 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz. The severity of hearing loss in the better ear was defined as mild for thresholds averaging 20–40 dB hearing level, moderate for 41–70 dB hearing level, severe for 71–95 dB hearing level, and profound in excess of 95 dB hearing level. The proband also underwent speech reception threshold testing.\nBlood samples from participating family members were obtained and genomic DNA was isolated blood using standard procedures. DNA from the proband was used for exome sequencing using the SureSelect v6 (Agilent) kit and sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina).

DPOAE threshold was defined as the f1 level required to produce a DPOAE of 5 dB SPL.\nPre- and post-synaptic puncta and cells were reconstructed semi-automatically using the “Surfaces” function in Imaris. A local contrast-background subtraction algorithm was applied to all z-stacks for thresholding. All reconstructions were created and reviewed with the researcher blinded to genotype. Inaccuracies in automatic segmentation were corrected manually. Reconstructions located outside the volume of hair cells were excluded from analysis. Image-based coordinates of reconstructed puncta were transformed into hair cell-centric coordinates using the “Reference Frames” function in Imaris. Each hair cell-centric coordinate system was defined with the following three planes: an XZ plane bisecting the hair cell through its plane of symmetry, a YZ plane bisecting the nucleus through the plane parallel to the tilt of the hair cell, and an XY plane tangential to the basolateral pole of the hair cell. Metrics regarding the size and localization of reconstructed pre- and postsynaptic puncta and cells were exported into Excel for further analysis. Volume measurements were normalized by the median of the control values within each stain batch. For quantification of c-Maf and Mafb stains, 3D reconstructions were made for each SGN cell body in Imaris similar as above using the HuD channel that marked all SGN cell bodies. Metrics regarding fluorescence intensity were exported into Excel for further analysis.\nFor\nFor SGNs from each genotype, Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed alongside regression modeling to quantify the association between normalized fluorescence levels for Calb2 and c-Maf. The regression slope, intercept, coefficient of determination (R\nRaw reads were converted to fastq files using the Cell Ranger pipeline from 10X Genomics v 3.0.1. Reads were then aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) in a Linux-based high performance computing cluster at Harvard Medical School.\nThe aligned data was imported into R and analyzed for statistical analysis and graphical representation in Seurat. The library was normalized by fitting the gene counts to a regularized binomial regression function implemented by the scTransform package for Seurat using all default settings and regression on percent mitochondrial reads.\nClustering was performed using the Seurat FindClusters command using 30 principle components. SGN clusters were identified and subsetted out by the expression of neuronal genes such as Tubb3 and Nefh. Utilizing the RNA assay, subsetted SGNs were normalized and subclustered using similar parameters as above. Subtypes of SGNs were identified by the expression of subtype specific markers previously identified (\nDifferential expression was tested using the FindAllMarkers command on the SCT assay and probing for significantly regulated genes between control and mutant SGNs from each genotype. The differential expression of cDKO genes was analyzed by subtype in each single cKO dataset. Genes were considered differentially expressed in mutant SGNs if they were significantly changed (\nKnockout datasets were projected onto control datasets as described previously for dataset integration.\nWritten informed consent was provided from participating individuals in an Iranian family who were ascertained as part of a large ethnically diverse hereditary hearing loss study. Pure-tone audiograms and medical information were collected from the proband at the age of 25 years, as well as his affected and unaffected siblings. Additional syndromic features were excluded. The proband underwent complete ear, nose, and throat examination, including binocular ear microscopy and inspection of the external ear. Routine pure-tone audiometry measured hearing thresholds at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz according to current standards. Air- and bone-conduction thresholds were measured and severity of hearing loss was determined by averaging pure-tone thresholds over 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz. The severity of hearing loss in the better ear was defined as mild for thresholds averaging 20–40 dB hearing level, moderate for 41–70 dB hearing level, severe for 71–95 dB hearing level, and profound in excess of 95 dB hearing level. The proband also underwent speech reception threshold testing.\nBlood samples from participating family members were obtained and genomic DNA was isolated blood using standard procedures. DNA from the proband was used for exome sequencing using the SureSelect v6 (Agilent) kit and sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina). Bioinformatic filtering and analysis were performed as previously described\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nSupplemental information can be found online at", "topic": "Neuroanatomy"}

As an exploratory aim, we examined autonomic and respiratory parameters—heart-rate variability, respiratory rate, respiratory variability, and end-tidal CO₂—to gain a comprehensive view of the underlying physiological mechanisms.\nThis study included 17 healthy undergraduate and graduate students (7 females, 10 males).

The experimental protocol constituted two counterbalanced sessions (slow-paced breathing [SB] and resting breathing [RB]), with each session comprising five phases: (1) Pre-task baseline measurement with 2 min crosshair fixation, (2) Breathing task (5 min duration, either 4 s inspiration/6 s expiration for SB or natural breathing rate for RB), (3) Post-task baseline measurement with 2 min crosshair fixation, (4) Aversive visual stimuli presentation (2 min exposure to International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images), and (5) Post-stimuli measurement with 2 min crosshair fixation. The State–Trait Anxiety Inventory-State (STAI-S) was administered after each fixation period. Sessions were separated by a minimum 2 h rest interval, with the order of breathing conditions randomized among participants.\nThe two sessions differed in their breathing task conditions, which were counterbalanced across participants using a randomized block design. Participants in the slow-paced breathing (SB) session followed visual cues to maintain a breathing pattern of 4 s inhalation and 6 s exhalation for 5 min, a duration shown to be sufficient for inducing physiological changes in previous studies (\nThe aversive stimuli comprised 40 images selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). These images were selected from a subset of 69 IAPS images previously validated to induce anxiety (\nPrior to preprocessing, all channels were visually inspected for quality. No channels were excluded or required interpolation in this study. The EEG data were analyzed using Brain Vision Analyzer 2.2 (Brain Products GmbH). The EEG data were recorded at 1,000 Hz, re-referenced using the average reference method, and then down sampled to 250 Hz. A zero-phase fourth-order Butterworth bandpass filter (0.1–30 Hz) and a 50 Hz notch filter were applied.\nEEG data were segmented into 2-min intervals corresponding to the Pre-task, Post-task, and Post-stimuli crosshair fixation periods. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was performed on these segmented data to remove eye movement artifacts (\nThe corrected EEG data were further segmented into 2-s epochs with 50% overlap. Epochs with remaining artifacts exceeding ±100 μV were excluded. However, no epochs were excluded after ICA-based artifact correction.\nFrontal alpha asymmetry (8–13 Hz) was computed for the midfrontal (F4-F3) and lateral frontal (F8-F7) regions using the natural logarithm transformation: rLFA = ln(right) − ln(left). Power spectral density was estimated using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) after applying a Hanning window (50% overlap). The employed EEG data processing and analysis procedures were based on established guidelines for frontal EEG asymmetry research (\nHRV analysis was performed using the HRVTool (version 1.07) in MATLAB R2020b (MathWorks) (\nExpired CO₂ waveform data were down sampled to 250 Hz to synchronize with the EEG data and analyzed using custom MATLAB R2020b scripts (MathWorks). A fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a 2 Hz cutoff frequency was applied to reduce noise, followed by zero-phase digital filtering. Moreover, we developed a peak detection algorithm for ETCO₂ detection, with the following parameters: a minimum peak interval of 1.0 s, a minimum peak height equal to the signal mean, and a minimum peak prominence equal to the signal standard deviation. The instantaneous respiratory rate was derived from the time intervals between consecutive ETCO₂ peaks, with values exceeding the median ± 2 standard deviations (SD) removed as outliers.

The key findings were as follows: (1) SB was significantly more effective than RB in reducing state anxiety post-task, an effect that subsequently buffered against the anxiety increase following aversive stimuli; (2) SB led to a significant increase in rLFA at the midfrontal site (F4-F3) compared to RB, and this effect also persisted immediately after aversive visual stimuli exposure; (3) A significant interaction was observed for RMSSD, an index of parasympathetic nervous system activity. Specifically, during the post-task period, RMSSD was lower in SB condition, but following aversive stimuli, it significantly increased only in SB condition.\nThe finding that SB buffered against the anxiety response to aversive stimuli is consistent with previous research on the anxiolytic effects of controlled breathing (\nIn parallel with the reduction in state anxiety, SB condition produced and maintained a left-lateralized shift in midfrontal rLFA.

Previous studies have shown that rLFA is influenced by dopaminergic system activity (\nAlthough slow breathing usually elevates RMSSD by strengthening cardiac vagal activity, we observed a transient reduction during the immediate post-task phase, followed by a marked increase after the stimuli presentation.

These findings highlight the practical potential of SB as an accessible and cost-effective intervention for mitigating anxiety and preventing stress response escalation. However, these promising results must be interpreted with caution due to this study’s limitations, including a small sample size and a cross-sectional design.

Here we show that acute block of a neuron-specific triglyceride lipase, DDHD2 (a genetic driver of complex hereditary spastic paraplegia), or of the mitochondrial lipid transporter CPT1 leads to rapid onset of torpor in adult male mice. These data indicate that in vivo neurons are probably constantly fluxing FAs derived from lipid droplets (LDs) through β-oxidation to support neuronal bioenergetics. We show that in dissociated neurons, electrical silencing or blocking of DDHD2 leads to accumulation of neuronal LDs, including at nerve terminals, and that FAs derived from axonal LDs enter mitochondria in an activity-dependent fashion to drive local mitochondrial ATP production. These data demonstrate that nerve terminals can make use of LDs during electrical activity to provide metabolic support and probably have a critical role in supporting neuron function in vivo.\nKumar et al. show that under glucose-depleted conditions, neurons can use fatty acids as an alternative source of energy to support synaptic function.", "full_text": "Genetic studies of hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) have identified over 80 different genetic loci associated with various forms of the disease\nIn other metabolically demanding tissues, LDs serve as a TG storage depot. LD abundance reflects the balance of LD assembly and catabolic pathways; in the latter, liberated FAs enter mitochondria for β-oxidation\nHere, we reveal a robust presence of DDHD2 lipase at synaptic terminals and show that blocking its activity leads to the accumulation of LDs at the majority of nerve terminals. Furthermore, using various metabolic and molecular sensors, we illustrate that electrical activity modulates DDHD2-mediated FA flux from LDs to mitochondria to drive ATP generation. We reveal that the metabolic support provided by FAs in turn can support synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling even in the absence of glucose. We show that in vivo, acute blockade of DDHD2 activity or the FA mitochondrial import machinery leads to a rapid onset of the torpor state in mice. Our study thus demonstrates that many neurons in the brain constantly rely on a steady flux of FAs derived from TGs to sustain function and provides mechanistic insights into DDHD2-mediated lipid metabolism in neurons.\nSynapses are crucial sites of motor coordination and memory formation. Depletion of DDHD2 lipase activity in neurons results in impaired motor and cognitive performance\nUsing a knockdown-validated DDHD2 antibody, we showed that the DDHD2 enzyme is over sixfold more enriched in neurons than in astrocytes (Extended Data Fig.\nMice treated with KLH45 (a selective DDHD2 inhibitor) over a period of 4 days show significant elevation of brain TGs, similar to changes observed upon genetic ablation of this enzyme\nWe carried out a biochemical purification of KLH45-induced LDs in our neuronal culture using a sucrose density gradient (Extended Data Fig.\nThese data demonstrate that under steady-state metabolic conditions, TGs are continuously being synthesized and consumed, as blocking DDHD2 activity shifts the balance to a net accumulation of LDs. We tested an alternative approach to tilt the balance towards LD accumulation: providing excess FAs to the growth medium. BODIPY staining in neurons, whose culture media was supplemented with excess mono-unsaturated FA (oleic acid) for 24 h, demonstrated that increasing the availability of FAs results in a net accumulation of LDs in soma (Extended Data Fig.\nIn various tissues, TGs are stored in LDs to serve as an alternative fuel source when glucose availability is limited. Lipases are necessary for TG hydrolysis, converting them into FAs in the cytosol. Subsequently, these FA molecules are converted into fatty acyl-CoA and delivered to the mitochondrial matrix by the mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyl-transferases (CPTs) for oxidation\nWe previously showed that electrical activity is tightly coupled to ATP synthesis in neuronal axons to meet the demands of nerve terminal function\nFatty acyl-CoA chains transferred to the mitochondrial matrix undergo a cyclic process to generate acetyl-CoA, which subsequently enters the tricarboxylic cycle to produce ATP.

It is initiated by the activity of a subset of hypothalamic neurons in the brain\nThe discovery that loss of DDHD2 function leads to a profound accumulation of LDs in neurons throughout the brain overturns a long-held view that neurons do not store, and therefore do not use, TGs as part of their metabolic programme. Given that loss of DDHD2 function in humans and mice leads to significant cognitive impairment, these results imply that this branch of metabolic support serves a critical role in sustaining neuron health and function, but previous studies did not examine what function these LDs, normally consumed by DDHD2, have. Here, we demonstrate conclusively that although LD abundance in neurons is very low at steady state, in agreement with most previous literature observations, this is the result of a constant flux of FAs through the LD pathway. Remarkably, we find that this pathway is important for axons, as DDHD2 is present in nerve terminals and its inhibition leads to the appearance of mature LDs in a majority of nerve terminals. We show that this flux itself is controlled by neuronal electrical activity and that FAs, once liberated from TGs in LDs, are transferred into the mitochondrial matrix, which then supports mitochondria-based ATP production. Both humans\nOur work now brings into focus several key questions that are central to brain bioenergetics; in particular, the source of FAs that are normally used to build LDs and subsequently consumed by DDHD2 and the route for delivery of FAs into the neuron cytoplasm. One class of attractive candidates that might act as the extracellular conduit for FAs are lipoprotein particles, a common vehicle for shuttling sterols and TGs throughout the body.

LD abundance reflects the balance of LD assembly and catabolic pathways; in the latter, liberated FAs enter mitochondria for β-oxidation\nHere, we reveal a robust presence of DDHD2 lipase at synaptic terminals and show that blocking its activity leads to the accumulation of LDs at the majority of nerve terminals. Furthermore, using various metabolic and molecular sensors, we illustrate that electrical activity modulates DDHD2-mediated FA flux from LDs to mitochondria to drive ATP generation. We reveal that the metabolic support provided by FAs in turn can support synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling even in the absence of glucose. We show that in vivo, acute blockade of DDHD2 activity or the FA mitochondrial import machinery leads to a rapid onset of the torpor state in mice. Our study thus demonstrates that many neurons in the brain constantly rely on a steady flux of FAs derived from TGs to sustain function and provides mechanistic insights into DDHD2-mediated lipid metabolism in neurons.\nSynapses are crucial sites of motor coordination and memory formation. Depletion of DDHD2 lipase activity in neurons results in impaired motor and cognitive performance\nUsing a knockdown-validated DDHD2 antibody, we showed that the DDHD2 enzyme is over sixfold more enriched in neurons than in astrocytes (Extended Data Fig.\nMice treated with KLH45 (a selective DDHD2 inhibitor) over a period of 4 days show significant elevation of brain TGs, similar to changes observed upon genetic ablation of this enzyme\nWe carried out a biochemical purification of KLH45-induced LDs in our neuronal culture using a sucrose density gradient (Extended Data Fig.\nThese data demonstrate that under steady-state metabolic conditions, TGs are continuously being synthesized and consumed, as blocking DDHD2 activity shifts the balance to a net accumulation of LDs. We tested an alternative approach to tilt the balance towards LD accumulation: providing excess FAs to the growth medium. BODIPY staining in neurons, whose culture media was supplemented with excess mono-unsaturated FA (oleic acid) for 24 h, demonstrated that increasing the availability of FAs results in a net accumulation of LDs in soma (Extended Data Fig.\nIn various tissues, TGs are stored in LDs to serve as an alternative fuel source when glucose availability is limited. Lipases are necessary for TG hydrolysis, converting them into FAs in the cytosol. Subsequently, these FA molecules are converted into fatty acyl-CoA and delivered to the mitochondrial matrix by the mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyl-transferases (CPTs) for oxidation\nWe previously showed that electrical activity is tightly coupled to ATP synthesis in neuronal axons to meet the demands of nerve terminal function\nFatty acyl-CoA chains transferred to the mitochondrial matrix undergo a cyclic process to generate acetyl-CoA, which subsequently enters the tricarboxylic cycle to produce ATP. We made use of a newly developed, genetically encoded ATP sensor with a large dynamic range targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, mito-iATPSnFR2 (ref.\nOur data demonstrate that axonal DDHD2 lipase activity facilitates the release of FAs from LDs, fuelling mitochondrial ATP production. A critical question is whether the ATP produced from LD-derived FAs can support synaptic function. To test this idea, we used endocytic retrieval of vGlut1–pHluorin at synaptic terminals as a measure of metabolic endurance\nConsistent with the need to assemble LDs, brief (5 min) incubation of neurons with extracellular FAs fail to sustain SV recycling in the absence of glucose (Extended Data Fig.\nTo rule out the possibility that the FA-driven improvement in SV recycling may have been caused by metabolites arising from glial cells in the same dish, we used lentiviral delivery to transduce all cells in the dish, driving the expression of an shRNA targeting CPT2 (Extended Data Fig.\nTorpor is an adaptive hypothermic state in warm-blooded animals that can be triggered by a combination of metabolic stresses, including food restriction and cold environments. It is initiated by the activity of a subset of hypothalamic neurons in the brain\nThe discovery that loss of DDHD2 function leads to a profound accumulation of LDs in neurons throughout the brain overturns a long-held view that neurons do not store, and therefore do not use, TGs as part of their metabolic programme. Given that loss of DDHD2 function in humans and mice leads to significant cognitive impairment, these results imply that this branch of metabolic support serves a critical role in sustaining neuron health and function, but previous studies did not examine what function these LDs, normally consumed by DDHD2, have. Here, we demonstrate conclusively that although LD abundance in neurons is very low at steady state, in agreement with most previous literature observations, this is the result of a constant flux of FAs through the LD pathway. Remarkably, we find that this pathway is important for axons, as DDHD2 is present in nerve terminals and its inhibition leads to the appearance of mature LDs in a majority of nerve terminals. We show that this flux itself is controlled by neuronal electrical activity and that FAs, once liberated from TGs in LDs, are transferred into the mitochondrial matrix, which then supports mitochondria-based ATP production. Both humans\nOur work now brings into focus several key questions that are central to brain bioenergetics; in particular, the source of FAs that are normally used to build LDs and subsequently consumed by DDHD2 and the route for delivery of FAs into the neuron cytoplasm. One class of attractive candidates that might act as the extracellular conduit for FAs are lipoprotein particles, a common vehicle for shuttling sterols and TGs throughout the body. Astrocytes are well known to produce lipoprotein particles that are secreted into the extracellular space in the brain\nWild-type strains of Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, strain no. 400, RRID:RGD_734476) and C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, strain no. 000664, RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664) were used to culture neurons and induce hypothermia, respectively.

FA-free BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, A8806) was overlayed on 0.1 M Tris (pH 8) at 37 °C and allowed to dissolve completely. Oleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, O1383) was added to the Tris-BSA solution in a 6:1 molar ratio and stirred gently at 37 °C to prepare the oleate–BSA complex. This complex was subsequently passed through a 0.22 µm syringe filter before being used in cell culture. Palmitic acid, in contrast to oleic acid, is solid at room temperature. FA-free BSA was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl at 40 °C, and palmitic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, P0500) was solubilized in 0.1 M NaOH by heating to 70 °C.

Then, 30 min before the end of incubation time, 50 nM MitoTracker Green FM (Thermo Scientific, M7514) was added to the media and the neurons were returned to the incubator. The neurons were washed once with HBSS and transferred to fresh HBSS (with inhibitors) and conditioned in an incubator.

Although prediction error signals, which reflect the discrepancy between predicted and actual sensory events, are a crucial component of predictive processing, the neural mechanisms underlying these signals remain elusive. Using a computational model, we investigate synaptic plasticity rules that learn prediction error signals in a local recurrent circuit. We find that recurrent networks trained with the proposed plasticity rules explain many features of prediction errors observed in experimental studies.

Traditional animal treadmill designs often entail preset speeds and therefore have reduced adaptability to animals’ dynamic behavior, thus restricting the experimental scope. Fortunately, advancements in computer vision and automation allow circumvention of these limitations. Here, we introduce a series of real-time adaptive treadmill systems utilizing both marker-based visual fiducial systems (colored blocks or AprilTags) and marker-free (pre-trained models) tracking methods powered by advanced computer vision to track experimental animals. We demonstrate their real-time object recognition capabilities in specific tasks by conducting practical tests and highlight the performance of the marker-free method using an object detection machine learning algorithm (FOMO MobileNetV2 network), which shows high robustness and accuracy in detecting a moving rat compared to the marker-based method. The combination of this computer vision system together with treadmill control overcome the issues of traditional treadmills by enabling the adjustment of belt speed and direction based on animal movement.", "full_text": "Treadmills are commonly used for investigating rodent gait and behavior, with extensive applications in neuroscience, rehabilitation medicine, and exercise biology [\nWith the rapid advancement of automation and computer vision powered by deep learning [\nIn this paper, we use an embedded vision platform (OpenMV) that can significantly reduce system design complexity and further ensure the stability of the system. The latest OpenMV4 Plus version model can run multiple algorithms for target detection and recognition tasks, including face detection, QR code recognition, and barcode recognition, among other targets. Spence et al. introduced a treadmill-based tracking system that uses Kalman filters to analyze video data, providing real-time estimations of locomotor velocity and position on the treadmill [\nThe stability of tracking results can be affected by multiple factors such as the texture of the animal’s fur, the lighting environment, and the deformation caused by motion. Those issues can be further addressed by introducing deep learning techniques into the object detection tasks, which have made significant progress and shown excellent performance in image processing [\nIn another aspect, we introduced the marker-free method based on a deep learning model, which was trained with an object detection machine learning algorithm, the FOMO MobileV2 network, as a convenient solution to eliminate the need for physical markers (like color blocks or AprilTags). Instead, it relies on the natural features of the animal for real-time object detection and tracking. The training performance of this neural network demonstrates excellent classification ability in dynamic environments where the animal is constantly changing position and posture on the treadmill.\nThe mechanical part of the treadmill consists of the drive motor, the conveyor wheels, and the support frame. In our design, the motor and mechanical parts are taken from a commercial animal platform (TREADMILL SIMPLEX II: Exer3/6 COLUMBUS INSTRUMENT). The control panel was removed, leaving the motor and conveyor wheels as well as the support frame. Then, the power supply, controller, and drives were added and integrated into a new automation system. The design shows a universal adaptability, allowing researches to modify their existing treadmill for intelligent applications.\nThe OpenMV camera module is used as a motor driver, and it features open-source, cost-effective, and notably potent machine vision support. It is powered by the STM32F765 ARM microcontroller and integrates OmniVsion’s OV7725 VGA CMOS sensor and the L298 motor drive module. OpenMV uses Python 3.0 programming language with embedded image sensor and advanced machine vision features, functioning as a programmable camera module [\nThe OV7725 VGA CMOS sensor acquires images and subsequently employs built-in image processing algorithms. This enables the system to compute the coordinates of the central point of target images and the field of view, which is commonly used in the field of computer vision and imaging processing. The deviation is obtained by subtracting those two coordinates. Then, the result is used for controlling motor speed and direction (\nBy deploying OpenMV as an artificial vision system for position detection, it analyses the information from the camera and controls the motor’s direction and speed. The motor’s speed and direction are dynamically adjusted based on the X-axis distance of the center position between the color block and the OpenMV camera’s field of view, ensuring that the animal remains stably positioned on the treadmill. The animal’s position is always focused on the center of the behavioral camera’s field of view, facilitating the sustained and stable capture of images for analysis of the animal’s gait and behavior. The detailed control method is described as follows.\nThe center coordinates of the field of view are calculated as follows:\nThe center coordinates of the target object are calculated as follows:\nHere,\nThen, we obtain the deviation value between the center of mass of the target object and the center of the image data as follows:\nThe adopted algorithms for motor direction control and speed adjustment are relatively simple. The motor’s rotational direction is opposite to the sign of the relative displacement. Therefore, when the object is in motion, the motor will rotate in the opposite direction. The motor’s rotational speed has a linear relationship with the absolute value of the displacement, and the speed increases as the absolute value of the displacement increases. The classical proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control method was used to dynamically adjust values for the speed and direction of the treadmill based on the deviation value as follows [\nHere,\nThe adjustment amount determines the movement direction and speed of the treadmill and is converted into control signal to adjust the moving object to the preset position of the treadmill as follows:\nDue to the different resistances of the belts of treadmills, in practice, the user needs to adjust the PID parameters and test the smoothness of the motor’s rotation.\nWe utilized an H-bridge DC motor driver module with high power output capacity to drive the motor’s rotation direction and speed. The control principle for the DC motor is as follows: A1.A2 = 0.0 for the brake; A1.A2 = 1.0 for forward rotation; A1.A2 = 0.1 for reverse rotation. PWM is used as the input signal to drive the motor under the control of a 15 K Hz square wave for motor speed regulation A 5 V supply power is provided to the OpenMV module, with a common ground connection for the driver board and the OpenMV control module (\nThe system control program is divided into three parts, labeled as ‘motor’, ‘pid’ and ‘main’, separately. Among them, ‘motor’ is used to control the motor’s forward and reverse rotation as well as speed control. The ‘pid’ part is used for PID control of the PWM signal. The ‘main’ part serves as the main program that calls ‘motor’ and ‘pid’, which is used for object recognition, extraction of pixel center positions, and calculation of center point offset displacement.\nThe system uses a consistent framework for detecting different types of targets, such as colored markers, AprilTags, or pre-trained models. For different types of target detection, similar methods are employed with the specific algorithm adjusted depending on the type of target.\nTo track rats directly from their body features, we adopted the FOMO MobileNetV2 network for the training of our marker-free object detection model. FOMO (Fast Object Detection and Tracking) uses MobileNetV2 as a backbone for its lightweight object detection of mobile devices and resource-constrained environments [\nLong Evans rats were used as testing subjects. Each rat had a uniquely trained model to minimize the influence of variable environmental and body feature factors on model performance. We standardized all pertinent environmental factors, including illumination, camera angle, and field of view, to ensure consistency between the training and real-world environments. For models deployed within a polycarbonate enclosure, testing indicated that black backgrounds yielded optimal performance; consequently, a black background was selected for these conditions.\nThe model was trained using Edge Impulse, a platform optimized for machine learning models tailored for embedded systems and edge devices. The full project is publicly available at\nBy evaluating the training process and the classification performance, the neural network demonstrated excellent performance by the end of the training. It effectively minimizes both training and validation loss while achieving high precision, recall, and F1 scores. The steady alignment of training and validation metrics suggests the model generalizes well without overfitting, making it a robust and reliable model for the marker-free object detecting task.\nMeanwhile, the training performance of this neural network, based on the provided precision, recall, and F1 score values, indicates the model achieved excellent performance with near-perfect metrics. The training performance of this neural network demonstrated remarkable classification ability. With a precision of 1.00, the model indicates that there were no false positives after epoch 1. The recall ranges from 0.98 to 1.00, demonstrating the model’s capability to identify nearly all relevant instances by epoch 14, and an F1 score between 0.99 and 1.00 reflects an almost perfect balance between precision and recall. These results suggest that the model has effectively learned the task and generalized well to the validation data.\nAfter training, we analyzed the classification performance using validation results from both the full-precision (float32) and quantized (int8) models. The float32 model achieved perfect classification (100% precision, recall, and F1 score) for both classes. In contrast, the quantized int8 model exhibited slightly lower recall (95.24%), reflecting a minor misclassification, while maintaining perfect precision and a high F1 score (97.6%) for the “Rat” class (\nThis may be attributed to FOMO’s design, which prioritizes centroids for efficient object detection rather than complete bounding boxes. When the object spans multiple grid cells but the network is overly focused on predicting centroids, it may “collapse” the detection to a single grid cell (the centroid), even when the object is recognized accurately. This issue can further be mitigated by increasing grid resolution to better represent objects that span multiple cells and adjusting the loss function to balance centroid predictions with spatial consistency across the object’s extent. This ensures that the training data include diverse object sizes and positions to teach the model to predict beyond just centroids. However, this issue reflects a trade-off in lightweight models like FOMO, where efficiency and simplicity may occasionally come at the cost of spatial precision. The detailed parameters of the model’s performance for object detection (including accuracy, precision, and F1 score) are summarized in\nWe evaluated the performance of this model in real-world tasks. In practical applications, the movement of animals involves changes in gait and dynamic adjustments of body posture and will cause significant deformation; thus, tracking errors caused by deformation are difficult to avoid.\nIn several cases where label detection failed due to environmental lighting (indicated as white arrow in\nIn this paper, we propose a series of intelligent upgrades for animal treadmills by leveraging our existing mechanical structures. These upgrades are compatible with traditional gait research paradigms. Notably, recent advancements in human rehabilitation have introduced an omnidirectional treadmill that allows for dynamic changes in speed and direction guided by virtual reality, facilitating more complex locomotor tasks [\nWe used OpenMV Cam as an embedded vision platform and one H-bridge driver board to achieve target recognition and positioning. It is a simple and cost-effective solution to modify our existing laboratory treadmill with a total cost of less than USD 150. It is important to note that the overall design of this intelligent treadmill system uses DC motors. Due to the significant electromagnetic noise generated by DC motors, in experiments requiring electrophysiological data collection, there might be substantial noise interference. Therefore, replacing it with a brushless servo motor would be a better choice for such experiments.\nIn our study, the PID parameters were empirically tuned using iterative testing in a controlled environment. The tuning process aimed to balance responsiveness (reducing latency in speed adaptation) with smoothness (avoiding oscillations that could affect animal behavior). In future work, we plan to implement adaptive or model-based control methods and quantitatively evaluate PID tuning under varying gait dynamics and environmental conditions.\nFinally, latency remains an inherent limitation in embedded systems, particularly under constrained computational resources. As emphasized throughout this work, our primary goal is to provide a cost-effective, open, and modular platform that can be adopted by the research community to retrofit traditional treadmills with modern control capabilities using off-the-shelf embedded components. Despite hardware limitations, the current implementation demonstrates viable real-time performance, with inference latency measured at approximately 87 ms per frame. Nonetheless, future deployment on more powerful embedded platforms—such as Cortex-M7, Cortex-A, ARC, or ESP32-S3—could help further reduce latency and enhance the responsiveness of the system in more demanding experimental conditions.\nIn this study, we provided adaptive treadmills and control methods based on real-time computer vision and demonstrated the capabilities of the FOMO MobileNetV2 model for real-time object detection in resource-constrained environments.

The first acetone step used ice-cold acetone, while the second was performed with acetone at room temperature.\nResin infiltration was carried out in a 1:1 solution of Durcupan ACM resin and acetone and incubated overnight on a shaker. The samples were then transferred in fresh 100% Durcupan ACM resin twice, with a 6–7 hr interval between transfers. During incubation in 100% resin, the samples were placed in a vacuum chamber on a rocker to facilitate the evaporation of residual acetone.

IMOD then interpolates a user-specified number of frames between the two views to create a smooth transition. This workflow supports creating multiple scenes (e.g. zooming in/out, rotations, or displaying image planes) as a sequence using the ‘Movie Sequence Dialog’.

This “active process” endows the cochlea with exceptional sensitivity, sharp frequency tuning, and broad dynamical range—yet its workings remain elusive. To date, the cochlea’s fragility and inaccessibility have confined studies in vivo, where global phenomena confound local dynamics. Bridging the gap between cellular and whole-organ behavior, we introduce a preparation that preserves the active process ex vivo in a cochlear segment and thus overcome a long-lasting experimental barrier. We show that the active process operates locally and that the sensory epithelium operates near criticality at a Hopf bifurcation. This result reveals a unified biophysical principle that underlies hearing across insects, nonmammalian vertebrates, and mammals alike.\nHearing hinges upon the ear’s ability to enhance its responsiveness by means of an energy-expending active process that amplifies the very mechanical inputs that it detects. This process is defined by four properties that, although seemingly unrelated, consistently occur together: amplification, sharp frequency tuning, compressive nonlinearity, and spontaneous otoacoustic emission. In nonmammal tetrapods, the active process is evident in individual hair cells. The hair bundles of the bullfrog, for example, exhibit all four attributes by operating near a Hopf bifurcation—a critical regime in which these properties naturally coalesce. In mammals, however, the delicate nature of the cochlea has restricted the evidence for an active process to studies in vivo, where it is generally attributed to the collective effort of the outer hair cells that energize the traveling wave along the cochlear spiral. As a result, the cellular mechanisms that underlie the properties of mammalian hearing remain contested, with uncertainty about whether criticality plays a role in the cochlea’s active process. Here we show that, when placed in a recording chamber that closely mimics the in vivo physiological environment, a segment of the mammalian cochlea ex vivo displays the features of the active process—amplification, frequency tuning, compressive nonlinearity, and the generation of distortion products. We show that this process operates locally, independently of traveling waves, and that the sensory epithelium achieves active amplification by operating near criticality at a Hopf bifurcation. The results reveal the existence of a unified biophysical principle that underlies auditory processing across species and even phyla.", "full_text": "The cochlea is a marvel of evolutionary engineering, a compact apparatus for resolving the spectra of sounds and encoding the information for processing by the brain. Central to cochlear function are hair cells, the extraordinarily sensitive sensory receptors of the internal ear (\nLike the cochlea as a whole (\nIn the mammalian cochlea, the active process is attributed to the working of the outer hair cells (OHCs), which reside in the Organ of Corti alongside inner hair cells (\nExcision and mounting of a cochlear segment. (\nIn a nonmammalian hair cell, the seemingly disparate features of the active process are achieved by means of a well-understood feedback mechanism that keeps the hair bundle on the verge of a mechanical instability termed the Hopf bifurcation (\nAlthough the cochlea as a whole displays all the hallmarks of the active process (\nEven the existence of active amplification within the cochlea remains a topic of contention. The compressive nonlinearity observed in vivo, for example, can be interpreted as the result of cumulative dampening as traveling waves propagate along the cochlear spiral (\nThere are two principal reasons for this impasse. First, because of the technical difficulties associated with research on the relatively inaccessible and extremely delicate mammalian cochlea, the active process of individual hair cells has largely been investigated in the simpler ears of nonmammalian vertebrates such as frogs and turtles. Second, the active process of the mammalian cochlea is complicated by traveling waves (\nIn this work, we examine the mechanical and electrical activity of isolated segments of a mammalian cochlea ex vivo under conditions that preserve key physiological features and closely replicate the in vivo environment. In the absence of a traveling wave, yet with both inner and OHCs operating within the normal anatomical and physiological context of the organ of Corti, we seek to isolate the local cellular mechanisms that underscore cochlear dynamics. More broadly, this approach allows us to ask whether the principle of criticality also underlies mammalian hearing and to explore the common behaviors that emerge from operation in a critical dynamical regime.\nTo investigate the active process of the mammalian cochlea ex vivo, we isolated cochlear segments 500 μm to 1,000 μm in length from the gerbil (\nA key simplification afforded by our system was the suppression of traveling waves. In the intact cochlea, sound-induced vibrations propagate as traveling waves along the 11.5 mm spiral of the gerbil’s organ of Corti (\nBy removing both the bony ceiling and floor of the second turn, we gained unobstructed optical access to the organ of Corti, enabling us to visualize active tissue with resolutions unattainable in vivo (\nA mathematical analysis of the Hopf bifurcation provides four well-defined predictions to test experimentally whether a cochlear segment is poised near criticality. First, the response of a dynamical system near such a bifurcation grows with a 1/3 slope on a doubly logarithmic scale as a function of the stimulus force when driven at its characteristic frequency (CF). Second, this power-law behavior is restricted to stimulus frequencies near the local CF. The relationship becomes linear for frequencies substantially greater or less than the CF. A system operating near a Hopf bifurcation thus unequivocally differs from one with a saturating nonlinearity, for in the latter instance, the slope does not depend on the stimulus frequency. Third, a critical system’s sensitivity peaks on the brink of a Hopf bifurcation. Detuning the cochlear segment, for example by altering physiological conditions, should decrease and linearize the response. Finally, a critical system displays cubic distortion products when stimulated simultaneously by two primary tones with nearby characteristic frequencies (\nTo assess frequency tuning in a cochlear segment, we presented zwuis multitone stimuli that permitted the simultaneous characterization of responses at several frequencies (\nWith these stimuli, cochlear microphonic responses and vibrational measurements of the organ of Corti demonstrated frequency-tuned behavior (\nFrequency tuning and compressive amplification in a cochlear segment. (\nSensitivity curves exhibited striking nonlinearity: Low-intensity stimuli elicited proportionately larger responses than high-intensity stimuli, a result consistent with the cochlea’s compressive dynamics. Near the CF of each segment, responses grew sublinearly, reflecting the cochlea’s active amplification process (\nNotice that when a Hopf oscillator is driven by a zwuis stimulus, the frequency components compete and interact through the oscillator’s nonlinearity and thus produce a stronger compression than would single-tone stimulation. As the number of simultaneous tones increases, the growth of response amplitude progressively flattens and approaches level-independence in the white-noise limit (\nTo investigate the compressive behavior of isolated cochlear segments, we examined their microphonic responses to single tones of varying intensity. Our experiments revealed that, at the CF, the microphonic response exhibited a pronounced compressive nonlinearity. When plotted on doubly logarithmic coordinates, the response grew sublinearly with a slope of approximately 1/3 (\nPower-law behavior in microphonic responses. (\nPower-law behavior in microphonic responses across cochlear segments. (\nAltering a preparation’s environment, for example by eliminating the endocochlear potential, yielded linear responses (\nIn 78 experiments on 48 gerbils, we stimulated cochlear segments with pure tones at frequencies ranging from approximately 600 Hz to 3,000 Hz. To obtain an unbiased estimate of the maximum compressive growth of the cochlear microphonic responses, we grouped data points in consecutive and overlapping triplets and quadruplets and performed a linear fit in doubly logarithmic coordinates. Fits were retained only if the SE of the slope did not exceed 0.15. This procedure yielded a distribution of slopes across the entire frequency range explored (\nComparing absolute response magnitudes across different preparations is challenging due to variations among animals, differences in cochlear dimensions, and other factors. To obtain an average response, we focused on those responses that exhibited any nonlinear behavior (defined as any slope smaller than 0.5). For each such curve, we plotted the sensitivity S as a function of the sound-pressure level\nThe fact that cochlear segments displayed increased sensitivity and a relationship of response magnitude to stimulus size that was strikingly nonlinear over a range of weak to moderate stimulation intensities is consistent with the operation of an active process in the mammalian cochlea. Because traveling waves were absent in our preparation (\nDistortion-product otoacoustic emissions, also called combination tones, are generated by the inner ear in response to a pair of simultaneously presented pure tones. When sounds are played at a higher primary frequency\nBy simultaneously delivering two tones into the experimental chamber through independent speakers, we elicited distortion products from cochlear segments ex vivo. We chose frequencies near a segment’s CF and used power spectra to monitor cochlear-microphonic responses at the primary frequencies and over a range of nearby frequencies. The first distortion products to emerge with a growing intensity of stimulation were 2·\nCubic distortion products from a cochlear segment ex vivo. (\nThe nonlinear characteristics of the cochlear segment and its microphonic responses indicate that the micromechanics of the organ of Corti likely exhibits nonlinear traits as well. By utilizing OCT, we could analyze the vibration patterns of specific cellular elements and establish a direct connection between their mechanical functions and electrical responses.\nDuring sinusoidal stimulation of the cochlear segment, we observed nanometer-scale vibrations in various parts of the organ of Corti including the reticular lamina (RL) and TM (\nNonlinear vibration within a cochlear segment. (\nOur experiments revealed that isolated segments of the gerbil’s cochlea ex vivo exhibit three hallmarks of the active process: amplification, frequency tuning, and compressive nonlinearity (\nHere\nThe Hopf normal form can be decomposed into three components: exponential growth or decline (\nWe seek a steady-state solution of the form\nThe Hopf framework also accounts for the generation of distortion products. These arise when primary tones of frequencies\nThe cochlea displays remarkable features for any physical system, let alone a biological one. These properties define the so-called active process, whose cellular mechanisms in mammals have remained elusive, largely owing to the fragility, anatomical inaccessibility, and complexity of the cochlea, which have precluded direct experimental access.\nAlthough challenging in its execution, the approach that we adopted to overcome these obstacles is conceptually straightforward: to isolate a functional segment of the organ of Corti as an ex vivo preparation devoid of traveling waves and to investigate the local dynamics underlying cochlear amplification. In this reduced ex vivo system, we observed key features of the active process: amplification, frequency tuning, compressive nonlinearity, and distortion products. These arose within a strip of sensory epithelium about 500 µm long, demonstrating that the active process does not necessitate traveling waves but can manifest locally. In this context, the nonlinear gain we observed cannot be explained as cumulative dampening or energy densification but points instead to the existence of a local process of amplification within the mammalian sensory epithelium.\nIsolated segments of the gerbil’s cochlea revealed three manifestations of an active process, consistent with the dynamics of a dynamical system operating near a Hopf bifurcation—a critical regime in which enhanced responses to stimuli, frequency tuning, and nonlinear amplification naturally coalesce. First, mechanical and electrical responses exhibited frequency selectivity. Independent experiments in which segments were exposed at varying positions along the cochlear spiral showed tuned responses that were consistent with the tonotopic map (\nA key difference between the tuning curves measured in our preparation and those in the intact cochlea is the lack of asymmetry and a low-frequency flank. This distinction is an expected consequence of the absence of traveling waves (\nThe relationship of response magnitude to stimulus size was strikingly nonlinear over a range of weak to moderate stimulation. The response usually scaled logarithmically as the one-third power of the stimulus, with few or no examples of lower slope. In an active system operating near a Hopf bifurcation, that scaling should be obtained only at and around the bifurcation, whereas stimulation at frequencies other than the CF could yield any slope up to unity. Indeed, by using several different pure frequencies or by applying multiple stimulus frequencies simultaneously, we could demonstrate a power-law slope at the CF but a greater slope away from that frequency. As observed in earlier recordings with less sophisticated apparatus (\nThese behaviors contrast with that expected from saturating nonlinearities—such as the sigmoidal activation curve of mechanotransduction channels driving OHC electromotility—which do not impose a fixed power-law relationship. Furthermore, a saturating nonlinearity does not guarantee any minimum slope in the log–log plot of response magnitude versus stimulus intensity, in contrast with what we observed in healthy cochlear segments.\nThe third manifestation of the active process lay in the combination tones or distortion products evoked by the simultaneous presentation of two primary frequencies near the CF. As expected for a cubic nonlinearity, such stimuli evoked combination tones of forms 2·\nTwo critical questions remain to be resolved: First, what are the exact roles of hair-bundle motility and membrane-based electromotility in effecting amplification and keeping the sensory tissue near a Hopf bifurcation? And second, how does the local active process integrate with traveling waves in the intact cochlea? The fact that a Hopf bifurcation appears both in individual hair bundles and in the mammalian cochlea as a whole does not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms have evolved to leverage criticality in mammals. Indeed, many types of dynamical systems can exist in the proximity of a Hopf bifurcation, and cochlear models that exclude hair-bundle motility can do so as well (\nFinally, our findings demonstrate that the mammalian cochlea harnesses the principle of criticality to enhance its response to stimuli. The result adds to the growing body of evidence that biological systems in general exploit this condition to optimize their functions (\nBy providing a high degree of experimental control and accessibility, our ex vivo preparation permits precise mechanical and electrical measurements and thus bridges the gap between cellular biophysics and systems-level behavior. In addition to offering an avenue to the identification of cellular mechanisms that regulate cochlear function, this work sets the stage for future exploration of the cellular and molecular intricacies of how the ear transforms mechanical signals into perception.\nThis paper provides a thorough description of the methods needed to create an experimental environment that accurately simulates the physiological conditions of the intact cochlea ex vivo, and therefore, contains detailed methodological information (\nAll experiments were conducted on three- or four-wk-old Mongolian gerbils (\nEach animal was killed by intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg·kg\nUsing a fragment of a razor blade 0.1 mm in thickness (Fine Science Tools), we separated the apical two turns by transecting the cochlea across its principal axis between the basal and middle turns. The upper turns were secured with isobutyl 2-cyanoacrylate adhesive (BOC Sciences) across a 1.5 to 2.0 mm-diameter hole in a plastic coverslip. We gained optical access to the cochlear partition by carefully removing the thin bone layers forming the middle turn’s ceiling and floor. To prevent leakage along the cochlear spiral and thus to confine electrical responses to the exposed cochlear segment, each cut end of the cochlear duct was sealed with cyanoacrylate adhesive. Finally, Reissner’s membrane was carefully removed (\nThe ostensibly unperturbed segment of the sensory tissue, 500 to 1,000 µm in length, suspended between the osseous spiral lamina and the spiral ligament and secured to a rigid disc, was placed in a custom-made tripartite experimental chamber (\nThe experimental chamber comprised two compartments, one that adjoined the apical surface of the cochlear segment and one that abutted the basolateral surface. The outer compartment was exposed to atmospheric pressure, whereas the inner compartment was closed and housed the inputs from two speakers as well as the front of a microphone (\nThe cochlear segment was maintained at the gerbil’s normal temperature (\nStimuli were synthesized by custom-written LabVIEW programs. After signal conditioning in a unity-gain power amplifier (SA1, Tucker-Davis Technologies), acoustic stimuli were generated by two earphones (ER-3C, Etymotic Research) coupled to the innermost compartment of the experimental chamber. The sound pressure in the air cavity was measured throughout each experiment with a free-field microphone (4939-A-011, Bruël & Kjær).\nTo reconstitute the ear’s endocochlear potential, we used a battery-operated current source to maintain a constant voltage of 80 to 100 mV across the preparation. A 1 mm Ag/AgCl pellet electrode was placed at the edge of the central hole in each fritted-glass disk, in contact with the saline solution near the preparation (\nA second pair of electrodes, also attached to the fritted-glass disks, measured the endocochlear potential and acquired the cochlear-microphonic potential excited by acoustic stimulation. The signal was preamplified X100 by a DC differential amplifier with low-pass filtering at 10 kHz (3000, A-M Systems), then amplified X200 and low-pass filtered at 5 kHz with an eight-pole Bessel filter (BM8.07, Kemo) before analog-to-digital conversion (PCIe-6353, National Instruments).\nCochlear microphonics were elicited by delivering single‐ or multitone stimuli—tapered at onset and offset—to ensure smooth temporal profiles, either in 200 repeated presentations or as a single extended stimulus (for OCT compatibility). For each trial, the recorded time trace was converted to the frequency domain by means of a discrete FFT, and the magnitude and phase at the stimulus frequency were extracted. A Rayleigh test (\nTo evaluate the condition of each preparation and measure its mechanical response to sound, we conducted OCT with a standard imaging system (GAN621, Thorlabs) whose optical path was horizontal. Equipped with a scanning objective lens (LSM02-BB, Thorlabs), the imaging head was mounted on a rigid rail facing the external fritted glass-containing compartment of the experimental chamber. An achromatic doublet lens of focal length 45 mm (AC245045B, Thorlabs) was placed 72 mm beyond the mounting plate of the scanning lens. A second achromatic doublet lens of focal length 19 mm (AC127019B, Thorlabs), spaced 169 mm from the mounting plane, confronted the specimen from a working distance of about 15 mm. The reference arm extended vertically, perpendicular to the imaging path.

Central to cochlear function are hair cells, the extraordinarily sensitive sensory receptors of the internal ear (\nLike the cochlea as a whole (\nIn the mammalian cochlea, the active process is attributed to the working of the outer hair cells (OHCs), which reside in the Organ of Corti alongside inner hair cells (\nExcision and mounting of a cochlear segment. (\nIn a nonmammalian hair cell, the seemingly disparate features of the active process are achieved by means of a well-understood feedback mechanism that keeps the hair bundle on the verge of a mechanical instability termed the Hopf bifurcation (\nAlthough the cochlea as a whole displays all the hallmarks of the active process (\nEven the existence of active amplification within the cochlea remains a topic of contention. The compressive nonlinearity observed in vivo, for example, can be interpreted as the result of cumulative dampening as traveling waves propagate along the cochlear spiral (\nThere are two principal reasons for this impasse. First, because of the technical difficulties associated with research on the relatively inaccessible and extremely delicate mammalian cochlea, the active process of individual hair cells has largely been investigated in the simpler ears of nonmammalian vertebrates such as frogs and turtles. Second, the active process of the mammalian cochlea is complicated by traveling waves (\nIn this work, we examine the mechanical and electrical activity of isolated segments of a mammalian cochlea ex vivo under conditions that preserve key physiological features and closely replicate the in vivo environment. In the absence of a traveling wave, yet with both inner and OHCs operating within the normal anatomical and physiological context of the organ of Corti, we seek to isolate the local cellular mechanisms that underscore cochlear dynamics. More broadly, this approach allows us to ask whether the principle of criticality also underlies mammalian hearing and to explore the common behaviors that emerge from operation in a critical dynamical regime.\nTo investigate the active process of the mammalian cochlea ex vivo, we isolated cochlear segments 500 μm to 1,000 μm in length from the gerbil (\nA key simplification afforded by our system was the suppression of traveling waves. In the intact cochlea, sound-induced vibrations propagate as traveling waves along the 11.5 mm spiral of the gerbil’s organ of Corti (\nBy removing both the bony ceiling and floor of the second turn, we gained unobstructed optical access to the organ of Corti, enabling us to visualize active tissue with resolutions unattainable in vivo (\nA mathematical analysis of the Hopf bifurcation provides four well-defined predictions to test experimentally whether a cochlear segment is poised near criticality. First, the response of a dynamical system near such a bifurcation grows with a 1/3 slope on a doubly logarithmic scale as a function of the stimulus force when driven at its characteristic frequency (CF). Second, this power-law behavior is restricted to stimulus frequencies near the local CF. The relationship becomes linear for frequencies substantially greater or less than the CF. A system operating near a Hopf bifurcation thus unequivocally differs from one with a saturating nonlinearity, for in the latter instance, the slope does not depend on the stimulus frequency. Third, a critical system’s sensitivity peaks on the brink of a Hopf bifurcation. Detuning the cochlear segment, for example by altering physiological conditions, should decrease and linearize the response. Finally, a critical system displays cubic distortion products when stimulated simultaneously by two primary tones with nearby characteristic frequencies (\nTo assess frequency tuning in a cochlear segment, we presented zwuis multitone stimuli that permitted the simultaneous characterization of responses at several frequencies (\nWith these stimuli, cochlear microphonic responses and vibrational measurements of the organ of Corti demonstrated frequency-tuned behavior (\nFrequency tuning and compressive amplification in a cochlear segment. (\nSensitivity curves exhibited striking nonlinearity: Low-intensity stimuli elicited proportionately larger responses than high-intensity stimuli, a result consistent with the cochlea’s compressive dynamics. Near the CF of each segment, responses grew sublinearly, reflecting the cochlea’s active amplification process (\nNotice that when a Hopf oscillator is driven by a zwuis stimulus, the frequency components compete and interact through the oscillator’s nonlinearity and thus produce a stronger compression than would single-tone stimulation. As the number of simultaneous tones increases, the growth of response amplitude progressively flattens and approaches level-independence in the white-noise limit (\nTo investigate the compressive behavior of isolated cochlear segments, we examined their microphonic responses to single tones of varying intensity. Our experiments revealed that, at the CF, the microphonic response exhibited a pronounced compressive nonlinearity. When plotted on doubly logarithmic coordinates, the response grew sublinearly with a slope of approximately 1/3 (\nPower-law behavior in microphonic responses. (\nPower-law behavior in microphonic responses across cochlear segments. (\nAltering a preparation’s environment, for example by eliminating the endocochlear potential, yielded linear responses (\nIn 78 experiments on 48 gerbils, we stimulated cochlear segments with pure tones at frequencies ranging from approximately 600 Hz to 3,000 Hz. To obtain an unbiased estimate of the maximum compressive growth of the cochlear microphonic responses, we grouped data points in consecutive and overlapping triplets and quadruplets and performed a linear fit in doubly logarithmic coordinates. Fits were retained only if the SE of the slope did not exceed 0.15. This procedure yielded a distribution of slopes across the entire frequency range explored (\nComparing absolute response magnitudes across different preparations is challenging due to variations among animals, differences in cochlear dimensions, and other factors. To obtain an average response, we focused on those responses that exhibited any nonlinear behavior (defined as any slope smaller than 0.5). For each such curve, we plotted the sensitivity S as a function of the sound-pressure level\nThe fact that cochlear segments displayed increased sensitivity and a relationship of response magnitude to stimulus size that was strikingly nonlinear over a range of weak to moderate stimulation intensities is consistent with the operation of an active process in the mammalian cochlea. Because traveling waves were absent in our preparation (\nDistortion-product otoacoustic emissions, also called combination tones, are generated by the inner ear in response to a pair of simultaneously presented pure tones. When sounds are played at a higher primary frequency\nBy simultaneously delivering two tones into the experimental chamber through independent speakers, we elicited distortion products from cochlear segments ex vivo. We chose frequencies near a segment’s CF and used power spectra to monitor cochlear-microphonic responses at the primary frequencies and over a range of nearby frequencies. The first distortion products to emerge with a growing intensity of stimulation were 2·\nCubic distortion products from a cochlear segment ex vivo. (\nThe nonlinear characteristics of the cochlear segment and its microphonic responses indicate that the micromechanics of the organ of Corti likely exhibits nonlinear traits as well. By utilizing OCT, we could analyze the vibration patterns of specific cellular elements and establish a direct connection between their mechanical functions and electrical responses.\nDuring sinusoidal stimulation of the cochlear segment, we observed nanometer-scale vibrations in various parts of the organ of Corti including the reticular lamina (RL) and TM (\nNonlinear vibration within a cochlear segment. (\nOur experiments revealed that isolated segments of the gerbil’s cochlea ex vivo exhibit three hallmarks of the active process: amplification, frequency tuning, and compressive nonlinearity (\nHere\nThe Hopf normal form can be decomposed into three components: exponential growth or decline (\nWe seek a steady-state solution of the form\nThe Hopf framework also accounts for the generation of distortion products. These arise when primary tones of frequencies\nThe cochlea displays remarkable features for any physical system, let alone a biological one. These properties define the so-called active process, whose cellular mechanisms in mammals have remained elusive, largely owing to the fragility, anatomical inaccessibility, and complexity of the cochlea, which have precluded direct experimental access.\nAlthough challenging in its execution, the approach that we adopted to overcome these obstacles is conceptually straightforward: to isolate a functional segment of the organ of Corti as an ex vivo preparation devoid of traveling waves and to investigate the local dynamics underlying cochlear amplification. In this reduced ex vivo system, we observed key features of the active process: amplification, frequency tuning, compressive nonlinearity, and distortion products. These arose within a strip of sensory epithelium about 500 µm long, demonstrating that the active process does not necessitate traveling waves but can manifest locally. In this context, the nonlinear gain we observed cannot be explained as cumulative dampening or energy densification but points instead to the existence of a local process of amplification within the mammalian sensory epithelium.\nIsolated segments of the gerbil’s cochlea revealed three manifestations of an active process, consistent with the dynamics of a dynamical system operating near a Hopf bifurcation—a critical regime in which enhanced responses to stimuli, frequency tuning, and nonlinear amplification naturally coalesce. First, mechanical and electrical responses exhibited frequency selectivity.

Microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with several inflammatory skin conditions, including atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, and rosacea. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analyses have provided a deeper understanding of the skin microbial communities in both health and disease. These discoveries are now being translated into novel therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring microbial balance and promoting skin health through microbiome-based interventions. Unlike conventional therapies that often disrupt the microbiota and lead to side effects or resistance, microbiome-based products offer a more targeted strategy for preventing and managing inflammatory skin diseases. These products, which include probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and live biotherapeutic agents, are designed to modulate the skin ecosystem by enhancing beneficial microbial populations, suppressing pathogenic strains, and enhancing immune tolerance. As a result, they represent a promising class of products with the potential to prevent, manage, and even reverse inflammatory skin conditions.

These formulations aim to restore microbial homeostasis and modulate immune responses, addressing the underlying pathophysiology of these chronic diseases. The advantages of MBPs are compelling, as they offer a multifaceted mechanism of action, including the modulation of the gut–skin axis, the enhancement of skin barrier function, and reduction in systemic inflammation. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that MBPs can reduce disease severity and inflammatory markers. In addition, MBPs generally exhibit favourable safety profiles, with minimal systemic absorption and a low risk of adverse effects.\nHowever, several challenges must be addressed. The complexity of the skin microbiome and individual variability in microbiota composition complicate the development of standardized treatments. Furthermore, the long-term effects of microbiome modulation are not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms of action of MBPs, along with clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of topical formulations. Such advancements may pave the way for the development of the first topical MBPs as therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases.\nLooking forward, the integration of personalized medicine, including microbiome profiling, holds promise for optimizing microbiome-based therapies.

It also hosts diverse microorganisms—bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea—that form communities supporting the immune system and defending against harmful microbes [\nMembers of the microbiota are being explored for diverse applications, including the treatment of dermatological and gastrointestinal conditions, as well as in improving skincare [\nThe skin, comprising approximately 15% of the adult body weight, functions as a complex barrier organ with physical, chemical, and immunological roles, while also supporting a site-specific microbiota through the provision of nutrients such as amino acids, fatty acids, and lactic acid [\nThe normal human skin microbiota is predominantly composed of the bacterial phyla\nThe composition of the human skin microbiota is relatively stable, though it varies according to the physiological traits of different body regions: sebaceous (e.g., face, chest, and back), moist (e.g., elbows, knees, and genitalia), and dry (e.g., palms) (\nAlthough the exact mechanisms underlying the maintenance and regulation of skin homeostasis remain unclear, it is well-established that the balance among the members of the skin microbiota plays a critical role in protecting against skin diseases [\nBeyond the skin microbiota dysbiosis paradigm, the skin-gut axis hypothesis proposes that the immune system, metabolic-hormonal pathways, and nervous system all play a role in linking gastrointestinal health and skin health [\nAtopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is the most common cause of skin illness worldwide with a prevalence of 2.6%, affecting over 200 million people [\nThe skin of AD patients exhibits significant alterations in microbial communities compared to that of healthy individuals, marked by pronounced microbial imbalance and decreased diversity. This is manifested by the significant reduction in\nHowever, it is still insufficiently clear how staphylococci contribute to the development of AD. To determine if elevated staphylococci levels precede clinical symptoms, one study monitored newborns by swabbing four distinct skin sites at three timepoints. The findings have shown that infants that developed AD by 12 months of age had significantly lower levels of commensal staphylococci present at 2 months compared to healthy controls, indicating that early exposure to commensal staphylococci may support the development of a healthy immune system and provide protection against the onset of disease later in life [\nCompared to the extensive research on skin bacteria, studies examining the diversity of skin fungi in AD remain limited.

The regulatory classification depends heavily on the product’s intended use, whether for therapeutic, nutritional, or cosmetic purposes, which directly affects how it is reviewed and approved [\nConsumer microbiome products, such as probiotics, dietary supplements, and personal care items, are usually regulated under food or cosmetic laws. These categories typically face limited pre-market oversight, leading to concerns about product quality, labelling accuracy, and consumer benefits and safety. In case therapeutic claims are made, they may be reclassified as drugs.\nMicrobiome-based therapies, particularly live biotherapeutic products (LBPs), are emerging as novel medical treatments designed to modulate the microbiome, improve health or treat disease. These products are generally regulated as drug or medicinal products by agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Regulatory requirements for LBPs and similar therapies include extensive documentation on identity, purity, potency, and safety, as well as robust preclinical and clinical trial data. Microbiome-based therapies vary in complexity and donor dependence ranging from fully complex like fecal microbiota transplantation, whole microbial ecosystems, and rationally designed microbial consortia, to simpler ones like LBPs (single-strain or mixtures of multiple strains), non-living biotherapeutic products and bacteriophages [\nAs knowledge is increasing and new products advance, regulatory frameworks need to evolve to reflect the challenges of product design and manufacturing, delivery methods, and targeted indications. The U.S. has taken the lead with the approval of therapies for recurrent\nStill, numerous scientific and regulatory hurdles remain, such as defining what constitutes a “healthy” microbiome, accounting for inter-individual variability, understanding complex host–microbiome interactions, evaluating long-term safety and validating/standardizing analytical methodology, strain isolation and banking as well as controlling manufacturing processes. Addressing these challenges will require continued collaboration among regulators, scientists, and industry stakeholders to ensure that safe, effective microbiome-based therapies reach patients and consumers worldwide.\nMBPs represent a promising therapeutic approach for inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis and rosacea. These formulations aim to restore microbial homeostasis and modulate immune responses, addressing the underlying pathophysiology of these chronic diseases. The advantages of MBPs are compelling, as they offer a multifaceted mechanism of action, including the modulation of the gut–skin axis, the enhancement of skin barrier function, and reduction in systemic inflammation. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that MBPs can reduce disease severity and inflammatory markers. In addition, MBPs generally exhibit favourable safety profiles, with minimal systemic absorption and a low risk of adverse effects.\nHowever, several challenges must be addressed. The complexity of the skin microbiome and individual variability in microbiota composition complicate the development of standardized treatments. Furthermore, the long-term effects of microbiome modulation are not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms of action of MBPs, along with clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of topical formulations. Such advancements may pave the way for the development of the first topical MBPs as therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases.\nLooking forward, the integration of personalized medicine, including microbiome profiling, holds promise for optimizing microbiome-based therapies. Additionally, interdisciplinary collaboration among dermatologists, microbiologists, and bioengineers will be essential to translate this promising science into clinically viable solutions.

Despite significant advances in X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the structural diversity of NMDA receptors across species and the variations among receptor subtypes within the same species remain insufficiently explored. Additionally, several key small molecule binding sites, such as those for agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators, have not been fully characterized. In this study, we utilized state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms to model NMDA receptors across multiple species and found that they all adopted a bouquet-like dimer-of-dimer structure. By comparing these models with cryo-EM resolved structures, we assessed the accuracy of the predictions and complemented the structural data with detailed models of transmembrane domain regions, which are traditionally challenging for experimental methods. Furthermore, through the integration of AI-based prediction tools and molecular dynamic simulations, we highlighted potential binding sites for agonists, competitive antagonists, and pore blockers at amino acid resolution. This AI-enhanced approach builds traditional structural biology techniques, revealing that NMDA receptors from different species adopt highly similar three-dimensional architectures, while also exhibiting subtype-specific structural features.

In addition, we predicted the binding modes of several small molecules and performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate their interactions detail. Together, these findings offer new insights into the structural diversity of NMDAR subtypes and provide valuable clues regarding potential binding pockets, which may facilitate future small-molecule drug discovery and optimization.\nBefore structure prediction, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data to explore the expression patterns of NMDAR subunits across human brain development using the UCSC Cell Browser\nSpatial-temporal expression pattern of NMDAR subunits in the brain.

(E) Representative immunostaining of GluN2C with a neuronal somatodendritic marker MAP2 in cultured neurons.\nFrom the second trimester to infancy (0–1 year), the overall NMDAR subunit expression increased, peaking with GluN2B. This was followed by a sharp decline in GluN2B levels, which is consistent with the developmental switch to GluN2A-containing NMDARs\nWe then explored the expression patterns in adult mouse brain regions. In higher-order brain regions such as the motor, frontal, temporal, and insular cortices, as well as in the corpus callosum\nWe further explored the expression of NMDAR subunits across different cell types in the brain based on the Allen Brain Cell Atlas. NMDAR expression was significantly higher in neurons compared to glial cells. Furthermore, excitatory neurons exhibited higher expression probabilities than inhibitory neurons (\nNext, we mapped the expression of NMDAR subunits across different cell types in coronal adult mouse brain sections.

The presentation of different cell types expressing different kinds of NMDAR subunits at different times in the same brain region also suggests the possibility of forming multiple subtypes of NMDARs.\nTo explore the evolutionary structural patterns of different NMDAR subtypes across species, we employed the AlphaFold multimer\nFor each prediction, we used the PLDDT score to assess the confidence of the predicted structures. A PLDDT score above 90 is considered excellent, 70–90 is acceptable, and below 70 requires careful evaluation before drawing conclusions. Similar to previously reported\nPrediction of NMDAR subtype structures across species using the AlphaFold2 or AlphaFold3. (A) Model of fruit fly NMDARs. (B) Model of NMDA subtypes across species.

(D) COM distance of R1-R2, D1-D, ATD-LBD, and LBD-TMD of GluN1-N2A across species. All models are colored by confidence level (pLDDT) from very low confidence (red) to good confidence (yellow) to high confidence (blue).\nOverall, NMDARs across all species displayed a similar tetrameric bouquet-like structure, consisting of four layers of ATD, LBD, TMD, and CTD. For the fruit fly, the single NMDAR expressed forms a classic dimer-of-dimer configuration. During the transition from the ATD to the LBD, domain swapping occurs, although it took place at the dimer level rather than the tetramer level, as seen in higher organisms and our predictions of vertebrate NMDARs. Despite this difference, the internal arrangement of the ATD and LBD is similar to traditional NMDARs. Compared to GluN2, the GluN1 subunit's ATD exhibits a looser R1-R2 interface, with a 5.8 Å (34.4 Å vs. 28.6 Å) longer centers of mass (COM). However, the LBD of N1 and N2A remains comparable (26.1 Å vs. 27.4 Å). The transition from the ATD to the LBD in both subunits is consistent. In terms of cross-sectional structure, the ATD of the fruit fly also maintains GluN1 on the periphery and GluN2A in the interior, with the COM distance between the two GluN2A subunits being roughly half that between the two GluN1 subunits distance (\nStarting with frog, seven subunits have been expressed and potentially form six di-heterotetrametric NMDARs: GluN1-N2A, GluN1-N2B, GluN1-N2C, GluN1-N2D, GluN1-N3A, and GluN1-N3B. Structurally, these subtypes can be divided into two major forms. All four GluN1-N2 subtypes in form 1 share a similar configuration, which is conserved across species from frogs to higher animals. Interestingly, this configuration shows remarkable structural conservation across species, as reflected by small root mean square deviation (RMSD) values. Moreover, the distance between the R1-R2 in the N1 subunits of GluN1-N2A across species ranges from 33.4 Å to 34.3 Å, while in the N2A subunits, the range is from 32.5 Å to 33.0 Å. Similar trends were observed in the COM distances between the D1-D2 regions of the LBD. Moreover, the distances between the ATD and LBD (52.9 Å to 55.0 Å for GluN1, 52.7 Å to 53,6 Å for GluN2A), as well as from the LBD to TMD4 (58.6 Å to 70.8 Å for GluN1, 63.5 Å to 69.3 Å for GluN2A), showed some variation (\nAll predicted GluN1-N2 receptors from both AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3 predictions presented the conventional NMDA receptor conformation (\nThe structural biology data and comparisons above indicate that the overall shape of the NMDAR is highly conserved across different species. In GluN3-related receptors, there appear to be two significantly distinct structural models. The human GluN1-N3A model\nTo assess the accuracy of the predicted NMDAR structures, we compared the human GluN1-N2 subtypes with the experimentally determined cryo-EM structures. The following cryo-EM models were used for comparison: GluN1-N2A (PDB: 7EOS), GluN1-N2B (PDB: 7EU8), GluN1-N2C (PDB: 8E92), and GluN1-N2D (PDB: 8E96).\nThe predicted models closely matched the cryo-EM data, with low overall RMSDs ranging from 3.63 Å to 6.90 Å (\nComparison of predicted and cryo-EM revealed GluN1-N2 structures. (A) Superimposed predicted models and cryo-EM determined GluN1-N2A, GluN1-N2B, GluN1-N2C, and GluN1-N2D structures. (B-D) Cross comparation predicted models with cryo-EM determined GluN1-N2 structures at ATD (B), LBD (C), and TMD (D) layers. (E) Comparation of GluN1-N1 dimer and GluN2-N2 dimer between predicted models with cryo-EM determined GluN1-N2 structures.\nThe LBD, a stable region of NMDARs, was more accurately predicted. Except for GluN1-N2D, the predicted LBD structures were more compact than those from cryo-EM, both within the dimer and across dimers. For GluN1-N2D, however, the predicted model showed larger inter-dimer COM distances compared than the cryo-EM model (49.0 Å vs. 48.6 Å and 45.8 Å vs. 46.0 Å), while intra-dimer distances were consistent (30.9 Å vs. 31.5 Å and 30.4 Å vs. 30.7 Å) (\nAt the TMD level, the COM distances in GluN1-N2A were significantly larger in the experimental structure compared to the predicted one (89.3 Å vs. 81.9 Å), whereas the opposite was observed for GluN1-N2B (79.4 Å vs. 85.9 Å). Due to limited resolution of the TMD in the cryo-EM structures for GluN1-N2C and GluN1-N2D, a direct comparison for these subtypes was not possible. Nevertheless, across all four predicted subtypes, the TMD COM distances were nearly identical (\nFurther analysis of the domain organization in the predicted models revealed nearly identical subunit arrangements, with slight differences in the orientation of domains. This resulted in a minor asymmetry across subtypes. For example, in GluN1-N2A, the R1-R1 COM distance between GluN1(A) subunits was 34.3 Å, while the LBD D1-D2 distance was 23.6 Å. Similar patterns were observed in GluN1-N2B, GluN1-N2C, and GluN1-N2D. The dihedral angle differences between the ATD and LBD were minimal for GluN1-N2A and GluN1-N2D (1.2° and 0.9°, respectively), while GluN1-N2B and GluN1-N2C showed greater asymmetry (3.8° and 4.8°), in line with the observed asymmetry in the cryo-EM structure of GluN1-N2C. Similar asymmetry was noted in the GluN2 subunits across all four NMDAR types (\nIn summary, these results demonstrate that the predicted and experimental structures maintain a considerable degree of consistency, suggesting the accuracy of the predictions. At the same time, the predicted structure provides information in the TMD region of GluN1-N2C and GluN1-N2D that the experimental structure does not fully provide.\nTo investigate the key amino acids involved in tetramer assembly, we conducted a more detailed analysis of the predicted models. Using LigPlot\nSubunit arrangements and interrelationships of the GluN1-N2 NMDARs. (A) Overall density model and subunit arrangement model at ATD, LBD, TMD layers of predicted GluN1-N2A. (B) Ligplot\nWe also found that several amino acids in GluN1 are involved in forming the GluN1-N2 LBD dimer. In GluN2A, the residues contributing to LBD assembly include C501, K507, F730, R731, E762, Q746, and E757, while in GluN2B, the key residues are D492, N665, A725, E757, and E769. For GluN2C, the relevant residues are E486, F494, S495, N667, R743, K760, and E762, whereas in GluN2D, they are E498, F506, S507, N679, E774, and D768 (\nWe used MOLE\nWe validated the predicted models through cysteine crosslinking experiments. Mutations were introduced at key amino acids involved in ATD assembly, given the ATD’s mobility and tolerance to crosslinking. For GluN1-N2A, we mutated four amino acid pairs, including N46C-H86C, N64C-G289C, I109C-Q78C, and G286C-R43C (\nIn summary, the above results identify the key amino acids that make up the tetramer at the ATD and LBD levels and further validate these amino acids by using traditional biochemical methods. Moreover, we also identify the pore-forming amino acids.\nOne major advantage of artificial intelligence algorithms is their ability to accurately predict protein-ligand binding interactions. In this study, we employed three of the latest algorithms, RoseTTAFold All-Atom, DiffDock-L, and DynamicBind for the prediction of the small molecular binding.\nFor the obligatory subunit GluN1, in addition to its endogenous agonist glycine, we also selected AICP\nPrediction of the structure of small molecules bound LBD.

The shared conservation of LBD binding niches between the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits suggests a common evolutionary origin that may have been retained throughout development (\nThe results for small molecules binding to the obligatory subunit GluN1 and alternative subunit GluN2 showed highly consistent. Key binding residues for GluN1 ligands, including glycine and other small molecules, were primarily via hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions, with residues like F460 and W707 involved in nearly all ligand interactions. For GluN2 subunits, binding was also driven by hydrophobic interactions. Notably, binding regions of GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C, and GluN2D suggest evolutionary conservation of the binding sites.\nThe NMDA R's pore is essential to its conductivity and serves as a key target for pharmacological agents. In our study, we conducted docking experiments with 20 small molecules, utilizing RoseTTAFold All-Atom, DiffDock-L, and Dynamic bind to predict their binding interactions within the pore regions of GluN1-N2 NMDARs. This selection included clinically established drugs, such as memantine, ketamine, felbamate, and tramadol, as well as compounds that failed in trials like MK-801 and PCP. Some molecules, including CNS-1102, are still undergoing trials for their neuroprotective potential.\nOur initial attempts using RoseTTAFold All-Atom to dock small molecules directly into the TMD were unsuccessful, likely due to limitations in generating high-quality TMD protein structures. The computational constraints and the complexity of predicting protein-small molecule interactions in this domain hindered further progress with this method. However, we achieved more accurate results with DiffDock-L and DynamicBind, which integrates AlphaFold prediction models to generate protein-small molecule complexes.\nBy focusing on the core helix of the TMD pore, we not only enhanced computational efficiency but also improved the accuracy of our predictions. In each DiffDock-L prediction, we generated 100–300 predictions, retaining only the highest-confidence structures for analysis. The confidence scores ranged from 0.11 to 4.11, with lower scores indicating higher prediction reliability. While the algorithm's precision is not absolute, and variability in predicted binding sites and dynamics exists, we prioritized the most confident predictions for further study. The small molecules were consistently predicted to bind within the vestibule region of the receptor pore, between the M3 helix bundle and the M2 pore loop (\nCertain molecules, such as amantadine, kynurenic acid, 1-PCA, and Riluzole, demonstrated high confidence scores across different NMDAR subtypes. Others, like CNS-1102, showed lower confidence scores for all subtypes. These variations may be attributable to the inherent differences in the biophysical properties of the molecules and their interactions with the receptor, although our methods do not yet allow for precise predictions of binding affinities (\nWe validated our docking predictions against cryo-EM-resolved structures of PCP, ketamine, and memantine, each of which binds within the pore region. For PCP, our predicted structure involved interactions with conserved residues GluN1 V620, T624, and GluN2B N582, L610, A611, and T614, with homology to residues identified in the cryo-EM structure (PDB 7SAB) (\nComparison of predicted PCP, ketamine, and memantine bound GluN1-N2B models and their cryo-EM models. (A) Illustration and Ligplot\nDue to limitations in computational resources, we were only able to perform detailed analysis on a subset of representative and functionally important compounds to validate our prediction results. Further analyses focused on dextromethorphan (DM), a commonly used cough suppressant\nTo further validate the accuracy and reliability of these predictions, we employed DynamicBind, an AI-based tool with a protein-ligand interaction prediction performance comparable to that of DiffDock-L. As expected, both algorithms produced highly consistent binding pocket predictions for DM across the four NMDAR subtypes. Not only were the predicted binding sites located in similar regions of the transmembrane domain, but the involved amino acids also showed a high degree of overlap. For example, in the GluN1-N2A subtype, DiffDock-L predicted the DM binding pocket to include GluN1 N592, V620, and T624, and GluN2A N581, L609, and T613 (\nTo further assess the dynamic behavior of TMD and small molecular binding, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the DM and GluN1-N2 complexes. Two simulations were conducted: a short MD simulation (50 ns,\nThese results show that although the structures of the small molecules are very different, many of them share the same binding cavities and some even share similar amino acids. This not only reveals the binding mechanism of existing small molecules and summarizes the similarity pattern but also provides more amino acid resolution precise targets for subsequent drug development.\nOur study employed cutting-edge algorithms to predict the structures of NMDARs across different species, revealing significant evolutionary conservation in these receptors. By comparing these predicted structures with experimentally resolved human NMDAR structures, we demonstrated the high reliability of our predictions and filled in gaps in the existing structural data. Subsequently, we conducted a detailed analysis of the human GluN1-N2 receptor, identifying and mapping key amino acids involved in receptor assembly, and further validated through classical biochemical techniques. Additionally, using the RoseTTAFold All-Atom, we uncovered the highly conserved agonists and competitive antagonists binding pockets within different NMDAR subunits. Through DiffDock-L, DynamicBind, and MD simulation, we conducted molecular docking analysis on small molecules targeting TMD. Our findings offer new perspectives on the evolutionary conservation of NMDARs, the diversity of their distribution in the brain, structural specificity and conservation among subtypes, and the binding niches of small molecules.\nNMDARs are fundamental to synaptic transmission, influencing critical functions such as learning, memory, and motor control\nHowever, the NMDAR system is highly intricate and complex in nature. During early development, NMDARs and non-NMDARs diverge to achieve more refined neural regulation\nGiven the physiological significance of NMDARs, their subtype diversity, and the role of small molecules targeting these receptors, a variety of small molecules have been developed\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has provided new tools for studying the structural features of NMDARs. Notably, the Nobel Prize-winning AlphaFold\nTo address these limitations, we not only compared and analyzed the predicted models against available experimental structures but also employed traditional biochemical approaches to further validate our findings. For predictions involving small-molecule binding sites - especially for TMD pore blockers - we performed molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to capture the dynamic nature of ligand binding and pocket flexibility. Ideally, electrophysiological validation or calcium imaging would be the gold standard to confirm functional relevance; however, due to current laboratory constraints, such experiments could not be conducted at this stage.\nIn summary, this study used state-of-the-art algorithms to predict the structures of NMDARs across different species, revealing both the conservation and diversity of these receptors across and within species. We identified and mapped the binding pockets and key amino acid residues for small molecules targeting the LBD and TMD of NMDARs. Our findings offer valuable insights into the widespread distribution and structural diversity of NMDARs, providing new perspectives for the development of small-molecule drugs targeting these receptors. These insights pave the way for the development of novel drugs and potential lead compounds.\nThe management and utilization of animals were strictly in accordance with the requirements of the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of the Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen (Approval number: 20240076).\nThe human GluN1 (residue 1–847,\nBrain section preparation and immunofluorescence staining were performed as previously described\nCultured rat hippocampal neurons are detailed in our previous descriptions\nPublicly available online datasets (Allen brain map;\nThe following full amino acid sequence of NMDAR subunits from difference spices were used:\nFor small molecules binding, we used both locally installed RoseTTAFold All-Atom\nFor the prediction of TMD in complex small molecules, we used location installed or online services of DiffDock-L and DynamicBind.

The one binding to channel pore with highest score was used for analysis. It took around two hours for a typical prediction with one 4090 TI GPU workstation. All the SDF files were either downloaded from PubChem or produced by ChemDraw (V22).\nThe predicted GluN1-N2 and dextromethorphan (DM) models were used as the initial models for molecular dynamics. The initial model was embedded in a pre-equilibrated palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer containing ∼70 lipid molecules using CHARMM-GUI\nThe parameter files for MD simulations were prepared and downloaded from the CHARMM-GUI website. With a series of restraints for the proteins, ligands, and lipid atoms, the solvated system was subjected to energy minimization. Then the minimized systems were heated from 0 to 310 K and equilibrated at constant pressure and temperature (NPT ensemble; 310 K, 1 bar) by gradually decreasing the positional restraints on the protein, ligand, and lipid atoms.

Furthermore, we leveraged advanced protein language models, such as RoseTTAFold All-Atom\nOur study highlights both the structural similarities and subtype-specific differences of NMDARs across various species and further validates the predicted structure of human NMDARs using biochemical methods. In addition, we predicted the binding modes of several small molecules and performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate their interactions detail. Together, these findings offer new insights into the structural diversity of NMDAR subtypes and provide valuable clues regarding potential binding pockets, which may facilitate future small-molecule drug discovery and optimization.\nBefore structure prediction, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data to explore the expression patterns of NMDAR subunits across human brain development using the UCSC Cell Browser\nSpatial-temporal expression pattern of NMDAR subunits in the brain.

(D) The expression pattern of NMDAR subunits RNA in the spinal cord. (E) Representative immunostaining of GluN2C with a neuronal somatodendritic marker MAP2 in cultured neurons.\nFrom the second trimester to infancy (0–1 year), the overall NMDAR subunit expression increased, peaking with GluN2B. This was followed by a sharp decline in GluN2B levels, which is consistent with the developmental switch to GluN2A-containing NMDARs\nWe then explored the expression patterns in adult mouse brain regions. In higher-order brain regions such as the motor, frontal, temporal, and insular cortices, as well as in the corpus callosum\nWe further explored the expression of NMDAR subunits across different cell types in the brain based on the Allen Brain Cell Atlas. NMDAR expression was significantly higher in neurons compared to glial cells. Furthermore, excitatory neurons exhibited higher expression probabilities than inhibitory neurons (\nNext, we mapped the expression of NMDAR subunits across different cell types in coronal adult mouse brain sections. We focused on three regions previously reported to show high GluN2C expression - the cortex\nIn the spinal cord, NMDAR subunits expression followed a pattern similar to that observed in the brain, with high expression of GluN2B, GluN2A, and GluN1 in astrocytes, GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocytes, glutamatergic neurons, and cerebellar granule cells (\nTo study the subcellular expression pattern of GluN2C in neurons, we used GluN2C antibodies to co-stain with a neuronal somatodendritic marker MAP2. Some GluN2C signals overlapped with MAP2, while others did not (\nThese findings show that NMDAR subunits are widely and diversely distributed throughout the brain. The presentation of different cell types expressing different kinds of NMDAR subunits at different times in the same brain region also suggests the possibility of forming multiple subtypes of NMDARs.\nTo explore the evolutionary structural patterns of different NMDAR subtypes across species, we employed the AlphaFold multimer\nFor each prediction, we used the PLDDT score to assess the confidence of the predicted structures. A PLDDT score above 90 is considered excellent, 70–90 is acceptable, and below 70 requires careful evaluation before drawing conclusions. Similar to previously reported\nPrediction of NMDAR subtype structures across species using the AlphaFold2 or AlphaFold3. (A) Model of fruit fly NMDARs. (B) Model of NMDA subtypes across species.

(D) COM distance of R1-R2, D1-D, ATD-LBD, and LBD-TMD of GluN1-N2A across species. All models are colored by confidence level (pLDDT) from very low confidence (red) to good confidence (yellow) to high confidence (blue).\nOverall, NMDARs across all species displayed a similar tetrameric bouquet-like structure, consisting of four layers of ATD, LBD, TMD, and CTD. For the fruit fly, the single NMDAR expressed forms a classic dimer-of-dimer configuration. During the transition from the ATD to the LBD, domain swapping occurs, although it took place at the dimer level rather than the tetramer level, as seen in higher organisms and our predictions of vertebrate NMDARs. Despite this difference, the internal arrangement of the ATD and LBD is similar to traditional NMDARs. Compared to GluN2, the GluN1 subunit's ATD exhibits a looser R1-R2 interface, with a 5.8 Å (34.4 Å vs. 28.6 Å) longer centers of mass (COM). However, the LBD of N1 and N2A remains comparable (26.1 Å vs. 27.4 Å). The transition from the ATD to the LBD in both subunits is consistent. In terms of cross-sectional structure, the ATD of the fruit fly also maintains GluN1 on the periphery and GluN2A in the interior, with the COM distance between the two GluN2A subunits being roughly half that between the two GluN1 subunits distance (\nStarting with frog, seven subunits have been expressed and potentially form six di-heterotetrametric NMDARs: GluN1-N2A, GluN1-N2B, GluN1-N2C, GluN1-N2D, GluN1-N3A, and GluN1-N3B. Structurally, these subtypes can be divided into two major forms. All four GluN1-N2 subtypes in form 1 share a similar configuration, which is conserved across species from frogs to higher animals. Interestingly, this configuration shows remarkable structural conservation across species, as reflected by small root mean square deviation (RMSD) values. Moreover, the distance between the R1-R2 in the N1 subunits of GluN1-N2A across species ranges from 33.4 Å to 34.3 Å, while in the N2A subunits, the range is from 32.5 Å to 33.0 Å. Similar trends were observed in the COM distances between the D1-D2 regions of the LBD. Moreover, the distances between the ATD and LBD (52.9 Å to 55.0 Å for GluN1, 52.7 Å to 53,6 Å for GluN2A), as well as from the LBD to TMD4 (58.6 Å to 70.8 Å for GluN1, 63.5 Å to 69.3 Å for GluN2A), showed some variation (\nAll predicted GluN1-N2 receptors from both AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3 predictions presented the conventional NMDA receptor conformation (\nThe structural biology data and comparisons above indicate that the overall shape of the NMDAR is highly conserved across different species. In GluN3-related receptors, there appear to be two significantly distinct structural models. The human GluN1-N3A model\nTo assess the accuracy of the predicted NMDAR structures, we compared the human GluN1-N2 subtypes with the experimentally determined cryo-EM structures. The following cryo-EM models were used for comparison: GluN1-N2A (PDB: 7EOS), GluN1-N2B (PDB: 7EU8), GluN1-N2C (PDB: 8E92), and GluN1-N2D (PDB: 8E96).\nThe predicted models closely matched the cryo-EM data, with low overall RMSDs ranging from 3.63 Å to 6.90 Å (\nComparison of predicted and cryo-EM revealed GluN1-N2 structures. (A) Superimposed predicted models and cryo-EM determined GluN1-N2A, GluN1-N2B, GluN1-N2C, and GluN1-N2D structures. (B-D) Cross comparation predicted models with cryo-EM determined GluN1-N2 structures at ATD (B), LBD (C), and TMD (D) layers. (E) Comparation of GluN1-N1 dimer and GluN2-N2 dimer between predicted models with cryo-EM determined GluN1-N2 structures.\nThe LBD, a stable region of NMDARs, was more accurately predicted. Except for GluN1-N2D, the predicted LBD structures were more compact than those from cryo-EM, both within the dimer and across dimers. For GluN1-N2D, however, the predicted model showed larger inter-dimer COM distances compared than the cryo-EM model (49.0 Å vs. 48.6 Å and 45.8 Å vs. 46.0 Å), while intra-dimer distances were consistent (30.9 Å vs. 31.5 Å and 30.4 Å vs. 30.7 Å) (\nAt the TMD level, the COM distances in GluN1-N2A were significantly larger in the experimental structure compared to the predicted one (89.3 Å vs. 81.9 Å), whereas the opposite was observed for GluN1-N2B (79.4 Å vs. 85.9 Å). Due to limited resolution of the TMD in the cryo-EM structures for GluN1-N2C and GluN1-N2D, a direct comparison for these subtypes was not possible. Nevertheless, across all four predicted subtypes, the TMD COM distances were nearly identical (\nFurther analysis of the domain organization in the predicted models revealed nearly identical subunit arrangements, with slight differences in the orientation of domains. This resulted in a minor asymmetry across subtypes. For example, in GluN1-N2A, the R1-R1 COM distance between GluN1(A) subunits was 34.3 Å, while the LBD D1-D2 distance was 23.6 Å. Similar patterns were observed in GluN1-N2B, GluN1-N2C, and GluN1-N2D. The dihedral angle differences between the ATD and LBD were minimal for GluN1-N2A and GluN1-N2D (1.2° and 0.9°, respectively), while GluN1-N2B and GluN1-N2C showed greater asymmetry (3.8° and 4.8°), in line with the observed asymmetry in the cryo-EM structure of GluN1-N2C. Similar asymmetry was noted in the GluN2 subunits across all four NMDAR types (\nIn summary, these results demonstrate that the predicted and experimental structures maintain a considerable degree of consistency, suggesting the accuracy of the predictions. At the same time, the predicted structure provides information in the TMD region of GluN1-N2C and GluN1-N2D that the experimental structure does not fully provide.\nTo investigate the key amino acids involved in tetramer assembly, we conducted a more detailed analysis of the predicted models. Using LigPlot\nSubunit arrangements and interrelationships of the GluN1-N2 NMDARs. (A) Overall density model and subunit arrangement model at ATD, LBD, TMD layers of predicted GluN1-N2A. (B) Ligplot\nWe also found that several amino acids in GluN1 are involved in forming the GluN1-N2 LBD dimer. In GluN2A, the residues contributing to LBD assembly include C501, K507, F730, R731, E762, Q746, and E757, while in GluN2B, the key residues are D492, N665, A725, E757, and E769. For GluN2C, the relevant residues are E486, F494, S495, N667, R743, K760, and E762, whereas in GluN2D, they are E498, F506, S507, N679, E774, and D768 (\nWe used MOLE\nWe validated the predicted models through cysteine crosslinking experiments. Mutations were introduced at key amino acids involved in ATD assembly, given the ATD’s mobility and tolerance to crosslinking. For GluN1-N2A, we mutated four amino acid pairs, including N46C-H86C, N64C-G289C, I109C-Q78C, and G286C-R43C (\nIn summary, the above results identify the key amino acids that make up the tetramer at the ATD and LBD levels and further validate these amino acids by using traditional biochemical methods. Moreover, we also identify the pore-forming amino acids.\nOne major advantage of artificial intelligence algorithms is their ability to accurately predict protein-ligand binding interactions. In this study, we employed three of the latest algorithms, RoseTTAFold All-Atom, DiffDock-L, and DynamicBind for the prediction of the small molecular binding.\nFor the obligatory subunit GluN1, in addition to its endogenous agonist glycine, we also selected AICP\nPrediction of the structure of small molecules bound LBD. (A) Chemical structure of small molecules, model illustration and Ligplot\nFor the alternative subunit GluN2, besides the endogenous agonist glutamate, we included CPP\nOur analysis of the predicted protein-ligand complexes, carried out with LigPlot\nIn the case of GluN2, glutamate binding to GluN2A, GluN2C, and GluN2D was driven mainly by hydrophobic interactions, whereas in GluN2B, hydrogen bonds with H453 and Y698 were also observed (\nSeveral regions of the small molecule binding pockets were conserved across all four GluN2 isoforms, including the sequences ‘SLTINEERSE’, TVPNGSTERNIR’, and ‘AFIYDAAVLN’. The shared conservation of LBD binding niches between the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits suggests a common evolutionary origin that may have been retained throughout development (\nThe results for small molecules binding to the obligatory subunit GluN1 and alternative subunit GluN2 showed highly consistent. Key binding residues for GluN1 ligands, including glycine and other small molecules, were primarily via hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions, with residues like F460 and W707 involved in nearly all ligand interactions. For GluN2 subunits, binding was also driven by hydrophobic interactions. Notably, binding regions of GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C, and GluN2D suggest evolutionary conservation of the binding sites.\nThe NMDA R's pore is essential to its conductivity and serves as a key target for pharmacological agents. In our study, we conducted docking experiments with 20 small molecules, utilizing RoseTTAFold All-Atom, DiffDock-L, and Dynamic bind to predict their binding interactions within the pore regions of GluN1-N2 NMDARs. This selection included clinically established drugs, such as memantine, ketamine, felbamate, and tramadol, as well as compounds that failed in trials like MK-801 and PCP. Some molecules, including CNS-1102, are still undergoing trials for their neuroprotective potential.\nOur initial attempts using RoseTTAFold All-Atom to dock small molecules directly into the TMD were unsuccessful, likely due to limitations in generating high-quality TMD protein structures. The computational constraints and the complexity of predicting protein-small molecule interactions in this domain hindered further progress with this method. However, we achieved more accurate results with DiffDock-L and DynamicBind, which integrates AlphaFold prediction models to generate protein-small molecule complexes.\nBy focusing on the core helix of the TMD pore, we not only enhanced computational efficiency but also improved the accuracy of our predictions. In each DiffDock-L prediction, we generated 100–300 predictions, retaining only the highest-confidence structures for analysis. The confidence scores ranged from 0.11 to 4.11, with lower scores indicating higher prediction reliability. While the algorithm's precision is not absolute, and variability in predicted binding sites and dynamics exists, we prioritized the most confident predictions for further study. The small molecules were consistently predicted to bind within the vestibule region of the receptor pore, between the M3 helix bundle and the M2 pore loop (\nCertain molecules, such as amantadine, kynurenic acid, 1-PCA, and Riluzole, demonstrated high confidence scores across different NMDAR subtypes. Others, like CNS-1102, showed lower confidence scores for all subtypes. These variations may be attributable to the inherent differences in the biophysical properties of the molecules and their interactions with the receptor, although our methods do not yet allow for precise predictions of binding affinities (\nWe validated our docking predictions against cryo-EM-resolved structures of PCP, ketamine, and memantine, each of which binds within the pore region. For PCP, our predicted structure involved interactions with conserved residues GluN1 V620, T624, and GluN2B N582, L610, A611, and T614, with homology to residues identified in the cryo-EM structure (PDB 7SAB) (\nComparison of predicted PCP, ketamine, and memantine bound GluN1-N2B models and their cryo-EM models. (A) Illustration and Ligplot\nDue to limitations in computational resources, we were only able to perform detailed analysis on a subset of representative and functionally important compounds to validate our prediction results. Further analyses focused on dextromethorphan (DM), a commonly used cough suppressant\nTo further validate the accuracy and reliability of these predictions, we employed DynamicBind, an AI-based tool with a protein-ligand interaction prediction performance comparable to that of DiffDock-L. As expected, both algorithms produced highly consistent binding pocket predictions for DM across the four NMDAR subtypes. Not only were the predicted binding sites located in similar regions of the transmembrane domain, but the involved amino acids also showed a high degree of overlap. For example, in the GluN1-N2A subtype, DiffDock-L predicted the DM binding pocket to include GluN1 N592, V620, and T624, and GluN2A N581, L609, and T613 (\nTo further assess the dynamic behavior of TMD and small molecular binding, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the DM and GluN1-N2 complexes. Two simulations were conducted: a short MD simulation (50 ns,\nThese results show that although the structures of the small molecules are very different, many of them share the same binding cavities and some even share similar amino acids. This not only reveals the binding mechanism of existing small molecules and summarizes the similarity pattern but also provides more amino acid resolution precise targets for subsequent drug development.\nOur study employed cutting-edge algorithms to predict the structures of NMDARs across different species, revealing significant evolutionary conservation in these receptors. By comparing these predicted structures with experimentally resolved human NMDAR structures, we demonstrated the high reliability of our predictions and filled in gaps in the existing structural data. Subsequently, we conducted a detailed analysis of the human GluN1-N2 receptor, identifying and mapping key amino acids involved in receptor assembly, and further validated through classical biochemical techniques. Additionally, using the RoseTTAFold All-Atom, we uncovered the highly conserved agonists and competitive antagonists binding pockets within different NMDAR subunits. Through DiffDock-L, DynamicBind, and MD simulation, we conducted molecular docking analysis on small molecules targeting TMD. Our findings offer new perspectives on the evolutionary conservation of NMDARs, the diversity of their distribution in the brain, structural specificity and conservation among subtypes, and the binding niches of small molecules.\nNMDARs are fundamental to synaptic transmission, influencing critical functions such as learning, memory, and motor control\nHowever, the NMDAR system is highly intricate and complex in nature. During early development, NMDARs and non-NMDARs diverge to achieve more refined neural regulation\nGiven the physiological significance of NMDARs, their subtype diversity, and the role of small molecules targeting these receptors, a variety of small molecules have been developed\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has provided new tools for studying the structural features of NMDARs. Notably, the Nobel Prize-winning AlphaFold\nTo address these limitations, we not only compared and analyzed the predicted models against available experimental structures but also employed traditional biochemical approaches to further validate our findings. For predictions involving small-molecule binding sites - especially for TMD pore blockers - we performed molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to capture the dynamic nature of ligand binding and pocket flexibility. Ideally, electrophysiological validation or calcium imaging would be the gold standard to confirm functional relevance; however, due to current laboratory constraints, such experiments could not be conducted at this stage.\nIn summary, this study used state-of-the-art algorithms to predict the structures of NMDARs across different species, revealing both the conservation and diversity of these receptors across and within species. We identified and mapped the binding pockets and key amino acid residues for small molecules targeting the LBD and TMD of NMDARs. Our findings offer valuable insights into the widespread distribution and structural diversity of NMDARs, providing new perspectives for the development of small-molecule drugs targeting these receptors. These insights pave the way for the development of novel drugs and potential lead compounds.\nThe management and utilization of animals were strictly in accordance with the requirements of the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of the Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen (Approval number: 20240076).\nThe human GluN1 (residue 1–847,\nBrain section preparation and immunofluorescence staining were performed as previously described\nCultured rat hippocampal neurons are detailed in our previous descriptions\nPublicly available online datasets (Allen brain map;\nThe following full amino acid sequence of NMDAR subunits from difference spices were used:\nFor small molecules binding, we used both locally installed RoseTTAFold All-Atom\nFor the prediction of TMD in complex small molecules, we used location installed or online services of DiffDock-L and DynamicBind.

For example, slow-paced breathing is used to promote mental calmness and has been clinically applied to alleviate anxiety and stress (\nFrontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) has been investigated as a neurophysiological marker of emotional and cognitive processes. Initially described in relation to approach and avoidance motivation (\nNevertheless, an accumulating body of electrophysiological evidence indicates that respiration modulates cortical α oscillations. A magnetoencephalography study demonstrated that the phase of the respiratory cycle modulates posterior alpha power, and these fluctuations predict near-threshold visual perception (\nSlow-paced breathing reliably attenuates anxiety during and immediately after practice, yet whether this benefit endures once a stressor intervenes remains uncertain. Controlled experiments demonstrate rapid declines in self-reported anxiety and sympathetic activity while participants follow paced-breathing protocols (\nAccordingly, this study aimed to test whether slow-paced breathing modulates state anxiety and rLFA, and whether these effects present immediately after exposure to aversive visual stimuli. We hypothesised that slow-paced breathing would reduce state anxiety and enhance rLFA relative to normal breathing, with these benefits being observable in the period immediately following the stimuli. As an exploratory aim, we examined autonomic and respiratory parameters—heart-rate variability, respiratory rate, respiratory variability, and end-tidal CO₂—to gain a comprehensive view of the underlying physiological mechanisms.\nThis study included 17 healthy undergraduate and graduate students (7 females, 10 males).

The experimental protocol constituted two counterbalanced sessions (slow-paced breathing [SB] and resting breathing [RB]), with each session comprising five phases: (1) Pre-task baseline measurement with 2 min crosshair fixation, (2) Breathing task (5 min duration, either 4 s inspiration/6 s expiration for SB or natural breathing rate for RB), (3) Post-task baseline measurement with 2 min crosshair fixation, (4) Aversive visual stimuli presentation (2 min exposure to International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images), and (5) Post-stimuli measurement with 2 min crosshair fixation. The State–Trait Anxiety Inventory-State (STAI-S) was administered after each fixation period. Sessions were separated by a minimum 2 h rest interval, with the order of breathing conditions randomized among participants.\nThe two sessions differed in their breathing task conditions, which were counterbalanced across participants using a randomized block design. Participants in the slow-paced breathing (SB) session followed visual cues to maintain a breathing pattern of 4 s inhalation and 6 s exhalation for 5 min, a duration shown to be sufficient for inducing physiological changes in previous studies (\nThe aversive stimuli comprised 40 images selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). These images were selected from a subset of 69 IAPS images previously validated to induce anxiety (\nPrior to preprocessing, all channels were visually inspected for quality. No channels were excluded or required interpolation in this study. The EEG data were analyzed using Brain Vision Analyzer 2.2 (Brain Products GmbH). The EEG data were recorded at 1,000 Hz, re-referenced using the average reference method, and then down sampled to 250 Hz. A zero-phase fourth-order Butterworth bandpass filter (0.1–30 Hz) and a 50 Hz notch filter were applied.\nEEG data were segmented into 2-min intervals corresponding to the Pre-task, Post-task, and Post-stimuli crosshair fixation periods. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was performed on these segmented data to remove eye movement artifacts (\nThe corrected EEG data were further segmented into 2-s epochs with 50% overlap. Epochs with remaining artifacts exceeding ±100 μV were excluded. However, no epochs were excluded after ICA-based artifact correction.\nFrontal alpha asymmetry (8–13 Hz) was computed for the midfrontal (F4-F3) and lateral frontal (F8-F7) regions using the natural logarithm transformation: rLFA = ln(right) − ln(left). Power spectral density was estimated using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) after applying a Hanning window (50% overlap).

A fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a 2 Hz cutoff frequency was applied to reduce noise, followed by zero-phase digital filtering. Moreover, we developed a peak detection algorithm for ETCO₂ detection, with the following parameters: a minimum peak interval of 1.0 s, a minimum peak height equal to the signal mean, and a minimum peak prominence equal to the signal standard deviation. The instantaneous respiratory rate was derived from the time intervals between consecutive ETCO₂ peaks, with values exceeding the median ± 2 standard deviations (SD) removed as outliers. Finally, we computed the mean respiratory rate (RR), the coefficient of variation of respiratory intervals (CVRR), and mean ETCO₂ values from the processed data.\nLinear mixed models (LMM) were employed to analyze psychological measures (STAI-S) and physiological indices (rLFA at F4-F3 and F8-F7, RMSSD, LF/HF ratio, RR, CVRR, and ETCO\nFor each model, the intervention condition (Factor 1: SB, RB) and measurement time point (Factor 2: post-task, post-stimuli) were specified as fixed effects.

We initially attempted to fit models that also included random slopes for the effects of condition and time, but these more complex models failed to converge for some outcomes. Therefore, to ensure model stability and reliable results across all variables, we proceeded with a more parsimonious model that included only random intercepts for participants.\nModel fit was evaluated using marginal and conditional R2 values, and residual diagnostics were assessed using QQ plots.

The key findings were as follows: (1) SB was significantly more effective than RB in reducing state anxiety post-task, an effect that subsequently buffered against the anxiety increase following aversive stimuli; (2) SB led to a significant increase in rLFA at the midfrontal site (F4-F3) compared to RB, and this effect also persisted immediately after aversive visual stimuli exposure; (3) A significant interaction was observed for RMSSD, an index of parasympathetic nervous system activity.

These findings highlight the practical potential of SB as an accessible and cost-effective intervention for mitigating anxiety and preventing stress response escalation. However, these promising results must be interpreted with caution due to this study’s limitations, including a small sample size and a cross-sectional design. Therefore, future research is essential to confirm these preliminary findings. In particular, longitudinal studies with larger and more diverse clinical populations are warranted. For instance, neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease are frequently accompanied by psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, which can negatively impact motor function (", "content_for_embedding": "Breathing is an essential autonomic function for sustaining life and a crucial physiological process that bidirectionally interacts with emotion. For example, slow-paced breathing is used to promote mental calmness and has been clinically applied to alleviate anxiety and stress (\nFrontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) has been investigated as a neurophysiological marker of emotional and cognitive processes. Initially described in relation to approach and avoidance motivation (\nNevertheless, an accumulating body of electrophysiological evidence indicates that respiration modulates cortical α oscillations. A magnetoencephalography study demonstrated that the phase of the respiratory cycle modulates posterior alpha power, and these fluctuations predict near-threshold visual perception (\nSlow-paced breathing reliably attenuates anxiety during and immediately after practice, yet whether this benefit endures once a stressor intervenes remains uncertain. Controlled experiments demonstrate rapid declines in self-reported anxiety and sympathetic activity while participants follow paced-breathing protocols (\nAccordingly, this study aimed to test whether slow-paced breathing modulates state anxiety and rLFA, and whether these effects present immediately after exposure to aversive visual stimuli. We hypothesised that slow-paced breathing would reduce state anxiety and enhance rLFA relative to normal breathing, with these benefits being observable in the period immediately following the stimuli. As an exploratory aim, we examined autonomic and respiratory parameters—heart-rate variability, respiratory rate, respiratory variability, and end-tidal CO₂—to gain a comprehensive view of the underlying physiological mechanisms.\nThis study included 17 healthy undergraduate and graduate students (7 females, 10 males). The mean age of participants was 22.18 years [standard deviation (SD) = 2.77, range: 20–30 years]. All participants were assessed as being right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (\nSubjective anxiety was assessed using the Japanese version of the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-JYZ;\nElectroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded from 32 scalp sites (see\nHeart rate variability (HRV) was derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings.

Environmental conditions were maintained at 22–24°C and 40 ± 5% relative humidity to minimize external environmental interference. All experiments were conducted between 13:00 and 17:00 to account for potential physiological variations due to the time of day.\nParticipants were instructed to abstain from alcohol and caffeine for 12 h before the experiment and to complete their meals at least 2 h before the experiment. Upon arrival at the laboratory, participants completed questionnaires regarding basic attributes (sex, age) and handedness. For physiological measurements, participants were instructed to empty their bladder, after which they were seated in a reclining chair and an experimenter attached the EEG, EOG, and ECG electrodes and the expired CO\nExperimental protocol timeline for investigating the effects of breathing tasks on aversive visual stimuli responses. The experimental protocol constituted two counterbalanced sessions (slow-paced breathing [SB] and resting breathing [RB]), with each session comprising five phases: (1) Pre-task baseline measurement with 2 min crosshair fixation, (2) Breathing task (5 min duration, either 4 s inspiration/6 s expiration for SB or natural breathing rate for RB), (3) Post-task baseline measurement with 2 min crosshair fixation, (4) Aversive visual stimuli presentation (2 min exposure to International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images), and (5) Post-stimuli measurement with 2 min crosshair fixation. The State–Trait Anxiety Inventory-State (STAI-S) was administered after each fixation period. Sessions were separated by a minimum 2 h rest interval, with the order of breathing conditions randomized among participants.\nThe two sessions differed in their breathing task conditions, which were counterbalanced across participants using a randomized block design. Participants in the slow-paced breathing (SB) session followed visual cues to maintain a breathing pattern of 4 s inhalation and 6 s exhalation for 5 min, a duration shown to be sufficient for inducing physiological changes in previous studies (\nThe aversive stimuli comprised 40 images selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). These images were selected from a subset of 69 IAPS images previously validated to induce anxiety (\nPrior to preprocessing, all channels were visually inspected for quality. No channels were excluded or required interpolation in this study. The EEG data were analyzed using Brain Vision Analyzer 2.2 (Brain Products GmbH). The EEG data were recorded at 1,000 Hz, re-referenced using the average reference method, and then down sampled to 250 Hz. A zero-phase fourth-order Butterworth bandpass filter (0.1–30 Hz) and a 50 Hz notch filter were applied.\nEEG data were segmented into 2-min intervals corresponding to the Pre-task, Post-task, and Post-stimuli crosshair fixation periods. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was performed on these segmented data to remove eye movement artifacts (\nThe corrected EEG data were further segmented into 2-s epochs with 50% overlap. Epochs with remaining artifacts exceeding ±100 μV were excluded. However, no epochs were excluded after ICA-based artifact correction.\nFrontal alpha asymmetry (8–13 Hz) was computed for the midfrontal (F4-F3) and lateral frontal (F8-F7) regions using the natural logarithm transformation: rLFA = ln(right) − ln(left). Power spectral density was estimated using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) after applying a Hanning window (50% overlap). The employed EEG data processing and analysis procedures were based on established guidelines for frontal EEG asymmetry research (\nHRV analysis was performed using the HRVTool (version 1.07) in MATLAB R2020b (MathWorks) (\nExpired CO₂ waveform data were down sampled to 250 Hz to synchronize with the EEG data and analyzed using custom MATLAB R2020b scripts (MathWorks). A fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a 2 Hz cutoff frequency was applied to reduce noise, followed by zero-phase digital filtering. Moreover, we developed a peak detection algorithm for ETCO₂ detection, with the following parameters: a minimum peak interval of 1.0 s, a minimum peak height equal to the signal mean, and a minimum peak prominence equal to the signal standard deviation. The instantaneous respiratory rate was derived from the time intervals between consecutive ETCO₂ peaks, with values exceeding the median ± 2 standard deviations (SD) removed as outliers. Finally, we computed the mean respiratory rate (RR), the coefficient of variation of respiratory intervals (CVRR), and mean ETCO₂ values from the processed data.\nLinear mixed models (LMM) were employed to analyze psychological measures (STAI-S) and physiological indices (rLFA at F4-F3 and F8-F7, RMSSD, LF/HF ratio, RR, CVRR, and ETCO\nFor each model, the intervention condition (Factor 1: SB, RB) and measurement time point (Factor 2: post-task, post-stimuli) were specified as fixed effects. The corresponding baseline value from the pre-task period was included as a covariate to control for individual baseline differences. We initially attempted to fit models that also included random slopes for the effects of condition and time, but these more complex models failed to converge for some outcomes. Therefore, to ensure model stability and reliable results across all variables, we proceeded with a more parsimonious model that included only random intercepts for participants.\nModel fit was evaluated using marginal and conditional R2 values, and residual diagnostics were assessed using QQ plots. Estimated marginal means (EMM) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and visualized. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted using Type III tests with Satterthwaite’s method for denominator degrees-of-freedom to assess the significance of fixed effects in the LMMs.\nStatistical significance was set at\nThe mean respiratory rate was 6.00 ± 0.11 breaths/min during SB condition and 14.76 ± 3.43 breaths/min during RB condition. These values indicated that participants successfully adhered to the instructed breathing patterns in each condition.

This study examined how neural architecture – in particular myelination – underlies brain activation patterns observed during IC tasks in a sample of 28 children aged 4–10 years old. IC was observed using reaction times during go/no-go and flanker IC tasks. Myelination was measured using quantitative longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) mapping obtained from selected white matter regions of interest (ROIs). Brain activation was defined as task-related changes in hemoglobin oxygenation as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) averaged within ROIs. Results indicated that myelination in ROIs was higher in older children and fNIRS activation in frontal channels was significantly and positively associated with go/no-go mean reaction time. Myelination in the corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus was positively associated with frontal fNIRS activation, while myelination was negatively associated with go/no-go and flanker mean reaction times across white matter ROIs.

We evaluate associations between myelination as measured by quantitative relaxometry (R1) acquired using the MPnRAGE technique (Kecskemeti et al.\nOur hypotheses were as follows: (1) Similar to previous work, we anticipate age-related and sex-related differences in R1, task-related fNIRS oxygenated hemoglobin changes, and IC performance (Cope et al.\nThis study included behavioral, MRI and fNIRS data collected from 51 children, aged 4–11 years old. Children were recruited from Waisman Center recruitment registries and via mass email distributed to university employees and students. Children underwent fNIRS, MRI, and behavioral testing on the same day. Inclusion criteria were lack of contraindications to MRI scanning, lack of limitations due to physical health, typical development, and English as primary language. Exclusion criteria included diagnosis of psychiatric or neurologic illness, developmental disorders, inability to undergo MRI scanning, or mothers with medical conditions or significant illness during pregnancy. Participants with incomplete MRI acquisition or fNIRS acquisition were excluded from the study, resulting in a sample of 28 children (14 females) between 4 and 10 years of age (mean = 6.8 years, SD = 1.9 years). Demographics are included in Table\nSample demographic characteristics\nData acquisition and processing methods are described in the ensuing paragraphs; the behavioral and fNIRS data acquisition methods are also described in (Zhou et al.\nChildren completed a go/no-go task in a sound-treated booth, seated 1.5 m from a computer monitor. Images were presented at the center, right, or left side of the monitor. Sounds were presented at a comfortable level from three loudspeakers (Tannoy Reveal 402) located in front of (0° azimuth), on the right (40° azimuth), or to the left (320° azimuth) of the child.\nThere were two types of trials administered during the go/no-go task:\nAt the beginning of the task, a dog image was shown at the center of the monitor, followed by a “bark” sound played by the center speaker after a 0.35 s delay. The dog then disappeared over a duration of 2.35 s. Children were trained to respond within 2 s after the onset of the sound and before the disappearance of the dog by pressing a one-button computer mouse when seeing a dog and hearing a “bark”. Between trials, a red balloon appeared on the left or right side of the monitor for 0.6s, to indicate the location for the ensuing images and sounds. After the balloon cue, a dog image was shown and a “bark” played from the balloon-indicated location – this trial was known as a “congruent” trial as the sound and image corresponded to the same animal and were in the same location as previously indicated by the red balloon.\nThere were two types of incongruent trials. For type 1 incongruent trials, the child might see a dog image but hear a “meow” sound, or vice versa. For type 2 incongruent trials, the balloon clue was on the incorrect side as the subsequent animal image/noise combination. Children were trained not to respond to incongruent sounds and images. Type 2 incongruent trials were introduced to add extra interference between informative cues and subsequent events. We did not distinguish the two types of incongruent trials in the data analyses, as they both were aimed to require IC through differential activation or suppression of motor responses depending on task requirements.\n“Go” events refer to congruent sounds and images, and “NoGo” events refer to incongruent sounds and images. Response to a “Go” event and lack of response to a “NoGo” event were met with a smiley face appearing on the monitor for 0.6s.\nChildren were trained on the rules of the task at their own pace before data collection. Once the experimenter was confident that the child was familiar with the rules, the child was taken to the fNIRS booth for another practice session, consisting of three congruent blocks and two incongruent blocks, at the same pace as the actual testing, but with no fNIRS data recorded. Throughout learning, practicing, and testing, the ratio of congruent trials to incongruent trials was approximately 2.5:1.\nThe overall block design consisted of two conditions. A congruent block (20.7 s) consisted of three congruent trials, while an incongruent block (20.7 s) consisted of one congruent trial, followed by two incongruent trials. The order of the type of incongruent trials was randomized across blocks. In the same block, the same dog image was presented, but across blocks, four different dog images and four different cat images were used to minimize boredom effects. After the onset of each block, there was a 12-s baseline where children were seeing four different and irrelevant cartoon pictures. The congruent condition was the grand mean average of all 8 congruent blocks, while the incongruent condition was the grand mean average of all 8 incongruent blocks. Blocks were administered across two 5-minute periods of 8 blocks each. See Fig.\nTrial design for congruent (Cg) and incongruent (InCg) conditions, along with calculation of Intra-incongruence ΔHbO and post-incongruence ΔHbO from HbO measured at three time points (pre-InCg, intra-InCg, and post-InCg) during Cg and InCg conditions. For each condition, the pre-InCg HbO measurement was the average HbO from 0 to 10.7 s following stimulus onset, the intra-InCg HbO measurement was the average HbO from 10.7 to 20.7 s following stimulus onset, and the post-InCg HbO measurement was after stimulus offset, and was the average HbO from 20.7 to 30 s following stimulus onset. Intra-incongruence ΔHbO was calculated by subtracting intra-InCg HbO between the and Cg and InCg conditions, and post-InCg ΔHbO was calculated by subtracting post-Incg HbO between the InCg and Cg conditions\nThe difference in mean RT between the incongruent and congruent conditions was calculated for all participants for the go/no-go task, in order to determine the effect of IC (required by the incongruent trials) on reaction times (Zhou et al.\nParticipants underwent a modified version of the flanker task as part of the NIH toolbox cognition battery, which is further described in (Zelazo et al.\nBoth scaled score and mean RT across all trials were calculated from the flanker assessment, but analyses were nonsignificant with scaled score, so only mean RT (flanker mean RT) are included in the current analyses. The test administration did not have separate incongruent and congruent trials as in the go/no-go task, so flanker mean RT was calculated as the overall mean RT of the task.\nfNIRS data were collected in a sound-treated booth via a continuous-wave NIRScout system (NIRx, Medical Technologies, LLC). The 16 light sources and 16 avalanche photodiode detectors were arranged to cover the frontal and temporal cortex in both hemispheres, and their orientation is pictured in (Zhou et al.\nWe determined differences in task-related brain activation as measured by fNIRS task-related changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO). HbO levels were measured during three time points for each condition (congruent and incongruent, Fig.\nIntra-incongruence ΔHbO was the difference in intra-InCg HbO between the incongruent and congruent conditions. This was the difference in brain activation between the incongruent condition, which required IC, and the congruent condition, which did not require IC. Higher values indicate higher brain activation during trials which require IC. Post-incongruence ΔHbO was the difference in post-InCg HbO between the incongruent and congruent conditions. This was the difference in brain activation following completion of the incongruent versus congruent conditions.\nAs described in (Zhou et al.\nFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy, spatial representation of channels.

The order of the three tests varied based on family preference and scheduling needs, with MRI generally collected last. NIH toolbox assessments were administered in a quiet playroom. fNIRS data were acquired during the go/no-go task in a sound-treated booth.\nFirst, we log-transformed flanker and go/no-go mean RT to address general linear model violations of normality as assessed using the GVLMA package in R (Pena and Slate\nTo address our 3 focal hypotheses, we conducted a series of general linear models in R, with log(age) and sex and their interactions included, as sex differences in brain-behavior relationships may be contingent on age, which is not addressed using simple correlations (DeCasien et al.\nSpecific analyses to address Hypotheses 2–4, following adjustments to improve model fit, are as follows: To assess hypothesis 2, we examined associations between ΔHbO and mean RT to evaluate how ΔHbO during the parts of the task requiring IC related to RTs on that task. Separate models were conducted for intra-incongruence and post-incongruence ΔHbO as well as both flanker and go/no-go tasks.\nFor hypothesis 3, we examined associations between R1 and mean RT values to evaluate the relationship between myelination and task performance. Again, separate models were conducted for both the flanker and go/no-go tasks.\nHypothesis 4 asked whether myelin content was related to task-related brain activation. We examined whether R1 was associated with intra-incongruence or post-incongruence ΔHbO in any of the predefined ROIs.\nLastly, in a more exploratory analysis building on analyses 2–4, only in regions where intra-incongruent or post-incongruent ΔHbO and R1 were associated with go/no-go scores, we examined whether R1 and ΔHbO uniquely or synergistically related to IC go/no-go task performance.\nThere were no significant correlations between sex and log(age), flanker RT, or go/no-go RT (all\nScatter plots of log(age) in days and average R1 in selected regions in 1/milliseconds (1/ms).

While preliminary and not withstanding multiple comparisons corrections, these associations aligned with our prediction that more myelination would be associated with faster processing speed (Scantlebury et al.\nThe positive relationship between SLF and ACR myelination and higher task-related activation did not withstand multiple comparisons corrections. Nonetheless, this relationship aligned with prior research suggesting a positive relationship between myelination and brain activation during cognitive tasks (Fornari et al.\nThere was preliminary evidence for an interaction between fornix myelination and frontal task-related brain activation during the go/no-go task, such that participants with higher myelination in the fornix showed a stronger positive association between frontal brain activation and task performance. Similar to previous research (Fornari et al.\nThis is the first study to our knowledge to combine myelin-sensitive quantitative relaxometry with temporally sensitive fNIRS functional activation data to understand the relationship between neural pathways associated with IC in the developing brain. Previous researchers have conducted similar analyses using dMRI metrics; however, dMRI is less specific to myelination than relaxometry based approaches (O’Muircheartaigh et al.\nThis work spans the ages of four to ten years; therefore, we do not have a large group of children representing any one age. However, this also allowed us to observe how the relationship between myelination and brain activation differs between young children and children nearing adolescence. Additionally, our go/no-go task may not have been challenging enough to accurately assess IC ability across our age range (Petersen et al.\nOne limitation of fNIRS is that it is only able to capture cortical activity and with poorer temporal resolution than other methods such as EEG, thus lacking information about deeper structures with high temporal specificity. Localization of this methodology is therefore poorer in comparison to MRI data; to combat this issue, we averaged activity across groups of optodes rather than analyzing individual optodes (Rahman et al.\nIn this work, we investigated the role of brain myelination in brain activation patterns observed during IC tasks, within a developmentally diverse cohort of children. Lower frontal brain activation and higher myelin content in the fornix, right uncinate fasciculus, and right superior fronto-occipital fasciculus were associated with faster IC reaction times. Myelin across white matter regions was related to higher brain activation, and higher myelin content in the fornix was related to a stronger positive relationship between brain activation and IC, suggesting a possible role of myelin in facilitating cognitive-load related increases in brain activation. Overall, significance level notably varied across models following multiple comparisons corrections, and power was limited by our sample size. Nonetheless, this work lays a foundation for leveraging multimodal imaging techniques to study relationships between brain myelination, activation, and inhibitory control across stages of child development. Future studies should focus on further elucidating these myelin–brain activation relationships across development with larger longitudinal samples.\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n\nSupplementary Material 1\n\nSupplementary Material 2", "content_for_embedding": "Inhibitory control (IC) is the ability to manage and suppress behaviors, emotions, and actions to achieve behavioral or cognitive goals (Diamond\nInsights from functional (fMRI), structural, and diffusion (dMRI) imaging studies have contributed to the current understanding of brain regions and networks involved in IC development and expression. fMRI studies in children and adults demonstrate increased activation with age during IC tasks in the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, orbitofrontal gyrus, lingual gyrus, and anterior cingulate gyrus (Cohen et al.\nStructural MRI studies have further implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyri, anterior cingulate cortex, basal ganglia, subthalamic nucleus, hippocampus, and fornix in IC (Benear et al.\nAs the aforementioned studies have demonstrated numerous brain regions involved in IC, it is likely that the development of IC requires a large-scale network with no single dominant brain region (Kang et al.\nIC development has been studied using a range of experimental paradigms, including the go/no-go, stop-signal, flanker, Stroop, and antisaccade tasks (Friedman and Robbins\nIn this study, we leverage a multi-modal approach to understanding the dynamic interplay between brain structure, activation, and behavior across sensitive periods of childhood. We evaluate how myelination across early to middle childhood relates to task-related functional brain activation and how these structural and functional neuroimaging features correlate with neurobehavioral assessments of IC. We evaluate associations between myelination as measured by quantitative relaxometry (R1) acquired using the MPnRAGE technique (Kecskemeti et al.\nOur hypotheses were as follows: (1) Similar to previous work, we anticipate age-related and sex-related differences in R1, task-related fNIRS oxygenated hemoglobin changes, and IC performance (Cope et al.\nThis study included behavioral, MRI and fNIRS data collected from 51 children, aged 4–11 years old. Children were recruited from Waisman Center recruitment registries and via mass email distributed to university employees and students. Children underwent fNIRS, MRI, and behavioral testing on the same day. Inclusion criteria were lack of contraindications to MRI scanning, lack of limitations due to physical health, typical development, and English as primary language. Exclusion criteria included diagnosis of psychiatric or neurologic illness, developmental disorders, inability to undergo MRI scanning, or mothers with medical conditions or significant illness during pregnancy. Participants with incomplete MRI acquisition or fNIRS acquisition were excluded from the study, resulting in a sample of 28 children (14 females) between 4 and 10 years of age (mean = 6.8 years, SD = 1.9 years). Demographics are included in Table\nSample demographic characteristics\nData acquisition and processing methods are described in the ensuing paragraphs; the behavioral and fNIRS data acquisition methods are also described in (Zhou et al.\nChildren completed a go/no-go task in a sound-treated booth, seated 1.5 m from a computer monitor. Images were presented at the center, right, or left side of the monitor. Sounds were presented at a comfortable level from three loudspeakers (Tannoy Reveal 402) located in front of (0° azimuth), on the right (40° azimuth), or to the left (320° azimuth) of the child.\nThere were two types of trials administered during the go/no-go task:\nAt the beginning of the task, a dog image was shown at the center of the monitor, followed by a “bark” sound played by the center speaker after a 0.35 s delay. The dog then disappeared over a duration of 2.35 s. Children were trained to respond within 2 s after the onset of the sound and before the disappearance of the dog by pressing a one-button computer mouse when seeing a dog and hearing a “bark”. Between trials, a red balloon appeared on the left or right side of the monitor for 0.6s, to indicate the location for the ensuing images and sounds. After the balloon cue, a dog image was shown and a “bark” played from the balloon-indicated location – this trial was known as a “congruent” trial as the sound and image corresponded to the same animal and were in the same location as previously indicated by the red balloon.\nThere were two types of incongruent trials. For type 1 incongruent trials, the child might see a dog image but hear a “meow” sound, or vice versa. For type 2 incongruent trials, the balloon clue was on the incorrect side as the subsequent animal image/noise combination. Children were trained not to respond to incongruent sounds and images. Type 2 incongruent trials were introduced to add extra interference between informative cues and subsequent events. We did not distinguish the two types of incongruent trials in the data analyses, as they both were aimed to require IC through differential activation or suppression of motor responses depending on task requirements.\n“Go” events refer to congruent sounds and images, and “NoGo” events refer to incongruent sounds and images. Response to a “Go” event and lack of response to a “NoGo” event were met with a smiley face appearing on the monitor for 0.6s.\nChildren were trained on the rules of the task at their own pace before data collection. Once the experimenter was confident that the child was familiar with the rules, the child was taken to the fNIRS booth for another practice session, consisting of three congruent blocks and two incongruent blocks, at the same pace as the actual testing, but with no fNIRS data recorded. Throughout learning, practicing, and testing, the ratio of congruent trials to incongruent trials was approximately 2.5:1.\nThe overall block design consisted of two conditions. A congruent block (20.7 s) consisted of three congruent trials, while an incongruent block (20.7 s) consisted of one congruent trial, followed by two incongruent trials. The order of the type of incongruent trials was randomized across blocks. In the same block, the same dog image was presented, but across blocks, four different dog images and four different cat images were used to minimize boredom effects. After the onset of each block, there was a 12-s baseline where children were seeing four different and irrelevant cartoon pictures. The congruent condition was the grand mean average of all 8 congruent blocks, while the incongruent condition was the grand mean average of all 8 incongruent blocks. Blocks were administered across two 5-minute periods of 8 blocks each. See Fig.\nTrial design for congruent (Cg) and incongruent (InCg) conditions, along with calculation of Intra-incongruence ΔHbO and post-incongruence ΔHbO from HbO measured at three time points (pre-InCg, intra-InCg, and post-InCg) during Cg and InCg conditions. For each condition, the pre-InCg HbO measurement was the average HbO from 0 to 10.7 s following stimulus onset, the intra-InCg HbO measurement was the average HbO from 10.7 to 20.7 s following stimulus onset, and the post-InCg HbO measurement was after stimulus offset, and was the average HbO from 20.7 to 30 s following stimulus onset. Intra-incongruence ΔHbO was calculated by subtracting intra-InCg HbO between the and Cg and InCg conditions, and post-InCg ΔHbO was calculated by subtracting post-Incg HbO between the InCg and Cg conditions\nThe difference in mean RT between the incongruent and congruent conditions was calculated for all participants for the go/no-go task, in order to determine the effect of IC (required by the incongruent trials) on reaction times (Zhou et al.\nParticipants underwent a modified version of the flanker task as part of the NIH toolbox cognition battery, which is further described in (Zelazo et al.\nBoth scaled score and mean RT across all trials were calculated from the flanker assessment, but analyses were nonsignificant with scaled score, so only mean RT (flanker mean RT) are included in the current analyses. The test administration did not have separate incongruent and congruent trials as in the go/no-go task, so flanker mean RT was calculated as the overall mean RT of the task.\nfNIRS data were collected in a sound-treated booth via a continuous-wave NIRScout system (NIRx, Medical Technologies, LLC). The 16 light sources and 16 avalanche photodiode detectors were arranged to cover the frontal and temporal cortex in both hemispheres, and their orientation is pictured in (Zhou et al.\nWe determined differences in task-related brain activation as measured by fNIRS task-related changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO). HbO levels were measured during three time points for each condition (congruent and incongruent, Fig.\nIntra-incongruence ΔHbO was the difference in intra-InCg HbO between the incongruent and congruent conditions. This was the difference in brain activation between the incongruent condition, which required IC, and the congruent condition, which did not require IC. Higher values indicate higher brain activation during trials which require IC. Post-incongruence ΔHbO was the difference in post-InCg HbO between the incongruent and congruent conditions. This was the difference in brain activation following completion of the incongruent versus congruent conditions.\nAs described in (Zhou et al.\nFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy, spatial representation of channels.

Whole-brain structural imaging was performed using a 3D T1-weighted MPnRAGE sequence with 1 mm isotropic resolution and an inversion-recovery magnetization preparation and three-dimensional radial\nR1 was used to quantify myelination within selected white matter regions across the brain. A multi-pass fitting procedure was used to estimate parametric maps of T1 relaxation times and denoised using total variation minimization (Kecskemeti and Alexander\nWhite matter ROIs were limited to regions thought to be involved in IC functions, including the genu of the corpus callosum (GCC), body of the corpus callosum (BCC), splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC), fornix (F), right and left anterior corona radiata (r/lACR), right and left superior corona radiata (r/lSCR), right and left posterior corona radiata (r/lSCR), right and left cingulate gyrus (r/lCG), right and left cingulum (hippocampal aspect, r/lCH, right and left fornix segments (rF/lF), right and left superior longitudinal fasciculus (rSLF/lSLF), right and left superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (r/lSFOF), right and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (r/lIFOF), and right and left uncinate fasciculus (r/lUF).\nChildren were tested with the NIH toolbox assessments, fNIRS go/no-go task, and MRI in separate sessions on the same day. The order of the three tests varied based on family preference and scheduling needs, with MRI generally collected last. NIH toolbox assessments were administered in a quiet playroom. fNIRS data were acquired during the go/no-go task in a sound-treated booth.\nFirst, we log-transformed flanker and go/no-go mean RT to address general linear model violations of normality as assessed using the GVLMA package in R (Pena and Slate\nTo address our 3 focal hypotheses, we conducted a series of general linear models in R, with log(age) and sex and their interactions included, as sex differences in brain-behavior relationships may be contingent on age, which is not addressed using simple correlations (DeCasien et al.\nSpecific analyses to address Hypotheses 2–4, following adjustments to improve model fit, are as follows: To assess hypothesis 2, we examined associations between ΔHbO and mean RT to evaluate how ΔHbO during the parts of the task requiring IC related to RTs on that task. Separate models were conducted for intra-incongruence and post-incongruence ΔHbO as well as both flanker and go/no-go tasks.\nFor hypothesis 3, we examined associations between R1 and mean RT values to evaluate the relationship between myelination and task performance. Again, separate models were conducted for both the flanker and go/no-go tasks.\nHypothesis 4 asked whether myelin content was related to task-related brain activation. We examined whether R1 was associated with intra-incongruence or post-incongruence ΔHbO in any of the predefined ROIs.\nLastly, in a more exploratory analysis building on analyses 2–4, only in regions where intra-incongruent or post-incongruent ΔHbO and R1 were associated with go/no-go scores, we examined whether R1 and ΔHbO uniquely or synergistically related to IC go/no-go task performance.\nThere were no significant correlations between sex and log(age), flanker RT, or go/no-go RT (all\nScatter plots of log(age) in days and average R1 in selected regions in 1/milliseconds (1/ms). Pearson correlation r values and corresponding p values are included for each selected region. Regions include: the genu of the corpus callosum (GCC), body of the corpus callosum (BCC), splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC), fornix (F), right anterior corona radiata (rACR), and left anterior corona radiata (rACR)\n\nTask-related change in fNIRS brain activation in the right frontopolar and left frontopolar region was associated with go/no-go mean RT. Specifically, intra-incongruence ΔHbO in the rFP (\nRelationships between intra-incongruence or post-incongruence ΔHbO and go/no-go mean RT.

We explore relationships between myelin content (R1), task-related brain activation (fNIRS ΔHbO), and measures of IC performance in a developmentally diverse cohort.\nRelations between myelination and IC measures, age, and sex revealed trajectories similar to previous work, with measures of myelin increasing logarithmically with age across the investigated epoch of childhood (Fornari et al.\nTask-related brain activation was not significantly associated with age in any of the ROIs identified for the fNIRS measures.

The reasons for generating an IVT library have been described extensively\nBriefly, to generate the IVT library, we start with Poly(A)-selected total RNA and synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcription and strand-switching. These steps are adapted from the ONT PCR-cDNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-PCS109), not for sequencing cDNA but to obtain high-quality double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as the template for in vitro transcription. The dsDNA is then transcribed into RNA using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (E2040S).

In such cases, do not add RCS (RNA Calibration Strand) to the RTA reaction as the RCS is optional according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

It is strongly recommended to install Conda and perform all analyses within dedicated Conda environments.\nTo facilitate the use of the protocol by people without an extensive computational background we also provide a quick guide on how to install miniconda3, create a conda environment, and install necessary software in it.\nInstall Miniconda using the following commands:\n#1. pull miniconda3 from anaconda.com\nwget --quiet https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n#2. check hash key of package\nsha256sum Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n#3. install miniconda3\nbash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /work/directory/<YOUR DIR>/SOFTWARE/miniconda3\n#4. source miniconda3 (if miniconda3 is active your terminal will show: (base) [<USER>@<NODE> <CURRENT DIR>])\nsource /<YOUR DIR>/miniconda3/bin/activate\nInstall minimap and samtools in a conda environment using the following commands:\n#required packages: samtools (v1.3.1) using htslib (v1.3.1)| minimap2 (v2.24)\n#1. create secondary environment for alignment\nconda create -n align2.24\n#2. activate|switch to secondary environment\nconda activate align2.24\n#3. install required packages\nconda install -c bioconda samtools\nconda install -c bioconda minimap2\n#4. return to (base)\nconda deactivate\nAll FAST5 files were output from MinKNOW onto the local hard drive and exported to the Northeastern University Discovery Cluster using the following command:\nscp <filename> <username>@xfer.discovery.neu.edu:/scratch/<username>\nBasecalling was performed on an NVIDIA A100 GPU using Guppy v6.4.2, and the rna_r9.4.1_70bps_hac_prom model with the following command:\n/<PATH TO GUPPY FOLDER>/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecaller -i /<YOUR FAST5 FOLDER>/ -s /<OUTPUT FOLDER>/ -c /<PATH TO GUPPY FOLDER>/ont-guppy/data/rna_r9.4.1_70bps_hac_prom.cfg -x cuda:all:100% -r --u_substitution\n/<PATH TO GUPPY FOLDER>/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecaller -i /<YOUR FAST5 FOLDER>/ -s /<OUTPUT FOLDER>/ -c /<PATH TO GUPPY FOLDER>/ont-guppy/data/rna_r9.4.1_70bps_hac_prom.cfg -x cuda:all:100% -r --u_substitution --resume\nWith the following commands, we provide one example of Dorado usage with Modified basecalling enabled for pseudouridine (--modified-bases pseU tag), and how to convert the raw unaligned bam file to FASTQ format retaining the base modification annotations (-TMM,ML,MM,Ml tags).\n#basecalling\n/<PATH TO DORADO FOLDER>/bin/dorado basecaller /<PATH TO DORADO MODELS FOLDER>/rna004_130bps_hac@v5.1.0 /<PATH TO YOUR POD5 FOLDER> --modified-bases pseU --emit-moves > /<OUTPUT FOLDER>/\n#unaligned bam to FASTQ conversion\nsamtools fastq -@ 64 -TMM,ML,MM,Ml /<PATH TO DORADO’S OUTPUT RAW_BAM FOLDER>/ > /<OUTPUT FASTQ>/\nThe FASTQ files were then merged into one file using the following command:\ncat /<YOUR FASTQ FOLDER>/∗.fastq > merged.fastq\nAlignment was performed on the merged FASTQ file using minimap 2.24.\n#1.source your conda environment\nsource /<YOUR DIR>/miniconda3/bin/activate\n#2.activate the environment in which minimap2 and samtools are installed\nconda activate align2.24\n$REFGENOME=/<PATH TO REFERENGE .fasta GENOME>/\n$MERGEDFQ=/PATH TO MERGED .fq/\n$SAM_UNF=/<PATH TO OUTPUT UNFILTERED SAM>/\n$SAM=/<PATH TO OUTPUT SAM>/\n$BAM=/<PATH TO OUTPUT BAM FILE>/\n#3.run alignment steps\nminimap2 -t 32 -ax splice -uf -k 14 $REFGENOME $MERGEDFQ | samtools sort -o $SAM_UNF -T reads.tmp\nsamtools view -h -F 4 -F 256 -F 2048 $SAM_UNF > $SAM\nsamtools view -S -b $SAM > $BAM\nsamtools index $BAM\n\nIn this section, we describe the steps for detecting pseudouridine sites transcriptome-wide. The pseudouridine detection is performed with Mod-\nMod-p ID is divided in five scripts. The description of key functions of each script is described below.\nStep1_PileUp.R script reads aligned and indexed sequencing data from BAM files corresponding to both direct RNA and IVT samples. The script generates distinct pileup summaries for both the sample and IVT, which include counts of nucleotide occurrences at each positions.\nStep2_Merge_replicate_pileups.R script reads the pileup files generated from the previous step, each corresponding to a different replicate and IVT, and combines the pileup data across replicates in one single merged file. In this way, each position detected in the sequencing data includes the summaries from all the replicates and the IVT.\nStep3_add_kmer.R annotates each candidate psi site with their corresponding k-mer sequence (k=5). As psi sites are modified uridine (U) sites, the code filters the dataset to retain only sites where the reference base in the genome is a T, which corresponds to U in RNA. For each site, the script uses the reference genome to extract the 5-mer sequence centered around the site.\nStep4_IVT_Kmer_Analysis.R reads the file containing the U positions and associated k-mers and calculates the frequency of each unique k-mer across the IVT. This allows to establish a baseline k-mer distribution in the IVT sample and find over/underrepresented k-mers in the unmodified RNA. This file is used as a lookup table in the next step, as it provides the expected basecalling error (U-to-C mismatch) for each specific sequence context.\nStep5_Add_pvalues.R calculates the p-values for each U position to quantify the likelihood of observed modification being statistically significant. The p-value is calculated by comparing the U-to-C mismatch of the direct sample to the IVT control. This step produces the final Merged_with_P_vals.csv file, which contains the pileup information, the k-mers and the p-values for each U site found across replicates in the sample and IVT libraries.\nMove all the .bam and corresponding indexed .bam files (.bai) obtained from the preprocessing step into one folder.\nClone or download the ZIP folder at\nUnzip the folder and open the PsiNanopore-main/Pvalue-Pipeline folder.\nOpen Step1_PileUp.R script.\nFollow the instructions found in the INSTRUCTIONS_Pvalue-pipeline.pdf document to modify the relevant pieces of code:\nWrite short names for your libraries (if you have replicates, use numbers to distinguish them, i.e., DRS1, DRS2) in the “replicate.name” field of the meta.data.df variable.\nProvide the names of the bam files moved to the same folder at step 42 following the same order as the “replicate.name” field.\nProvide the path of the reference genome fasta file in hg38.fa variable.

We usually name this IVT_kmer_Analysis.csv.\nCreate a folder named finalized_pileup inside the init_gene_pileup folder.\nProvide the path of the finalized_pileup folder in the merged.Uonly.Pileup.out.dir variable and include the name of the file in which to store the results.

We usually call this file Merged_with_P_vals.csv and save it under the finalized_pileup folder created at step 48c.\nRun the script.\n\nIn this section, we describe how to perform differential analysis on the untreated and RA-differentiated libraries described in Fanari et al., where we applied Mod-p ID to untreated and RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. This allowed us to determine the U-to-C mismatch, read coverage and p-values at each U position (T in the genomic reference) using the IVT library as a control to establish the expected background in the unmodified RNA. We then applied a series of filtering steps to define high-confidence modification sites. The filtering steps, described in the original paper and in the next steps of this protocol, took into consideration occupancy levels (U-to-C %mm >10 in the sample and U-to-C %mm <10 in the IVT;\nIVT filtration criteria to select modified sites in DRS libraries can be visualized with IGV\n(A) IGV screenshot shows a valid psi-site with a U-to-C %mm <10 in the IVT library, as shown by the clean (gray) bands.\n(B) IGV screenshot shows an example of a candidate psi-site we exclude as the U-to-C %mm >10 in the IVT library, as shown by a colored band.\nAll the code described in this section can be found at the following link:\nLoad the Merged_with_P_vals.csv file in Rstudio.\nDRS<-read.csv(“path_to_Merged_with_P_vals.csv file”)\nFilter the Merged_with_P_vals.csv file.\nFilter and keep only significant psi-sites p<0.001.

You may reference previously published techniques, such as those described in Fanari et al., or experimentally validate sites in your specific cell line by knocking down known PUS enzymes and observing a reduction in mismatch errors at modified positions.\nPerform the differential analysis.\nCalculate the U-to-C mismatch difference between the two conditions.\nSH_filter_sigma2$mm.DiffminusUndiff<-SH_filter_sigma2$mm.Diff-SH_filter_sigma2$mm.Undiff\nCalculate the confidence interval (CI) for the differential U-to-C mismatch.

For your sample RNA sequencing (DRS) libraries, starting with 500 ng of poly(A)-selected RNA routinely yields sufficient sequencing output for robust downstream analysis.\nIn terms of computational analysis, successful pipeline execution should result in a table of statistically significant ψ-sites. These are derived by comparing mismatch patterns between DRS and IVT datasets. The final CSV file used in this pipeline is outputted by Step5_Add_pvalues.R. Although the previous steps produce output CSV tables, these are used by the Mod-p ID pipeline and we don’t use them in the next filtration steps.\nThe CSV file contains: the k-mer centered at each uridine site detected in each direct replicate and the IVT library; the read coverage (number of T and C nucleotides and the total number of reads detected at each position) for each uridine site detected in each direct replicate and the IVT; the U-to-C mismatch percentage calculated for each uridine site detected in each direct replicate and IVT; the p-value calculated for each uridine site detected in each direct replicate and the IVT.\nIn IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) plots, true positive psi-sites are typically characterized by elevated U-to-C mismatches in the DRS sample and negligible mismatches in the IVT sample, which lacks modifications. The IGV traces can be visualized using the same aligned and indexed BAM files used as input by Step1_PileUp.R in Mod-p ID. We use IGV traces to manually inspect positions and ensure that the IVT traces have negligible mismatch to the genomic reference.\nTo minimize false positives, we apply a stringent filter: we retain only those sites where the U-to-C mismatch in the IVT library is <10%. This threshold helps ensure that retained sites are not sequence variants or artifacts due to problematic k-mers. Importantly, this allows the inclusion of lower-coverage sites, as the low IVT mismatch gives confidence in their validity. A typical output includes several hundred high-confidence psi-sites per library, depending on coverage and cell type.\nThis protocol, while robust and reproducible, presents several limitations that users should be aware of. Nanopore-based detection of RNA modifications, including pseudouridine, is inherently noisy. The Mod-\nThis method detects the presence/absence and relative occupancy differences of ψ-sites but does not yield precise stoichiometry. For researchers interested in quantifying the fraction of molecules modified at a site, we recommend using synthetic RNA strands and dedicated quantification tools like ModQuant.\nResults may be affected by differences in ONT chemistries (e.g., RNA002 vs. RNA004) and platforms (e.g., MinION vs PromethION), especially in terms of read depth and coverage. Users must account for these differences when comparing datasets.\nThe accuracy of detection relies heavily on having a matched IVT library. If an IVT control for the same cell type is unavailable, results may suffer in accuracy. Public IVT datasets can be used, but users should interpret findings cautiously if there are sequence or expression-level mismatches.\nDifficulty isolating only the aqueous phase during RNA extraction, leading to contamination from the interphase.\nConsider using Phasemaker Tubes to simplify phase separation and reduce contamination.

The replicate’s names chosen at step 45.a.i. need to be the same and used as suffixes in all necessary variables with the same spelling specified at 45.a.i. point of the Mod-p ID protocol.\nThe files created by Mod-p ID contain the same values copy-pasted in multiple columns or only zeroes in a column.\n\nThe names of two different replicates were misspelled in one of the variables. Therefore, the same values were copied in two different columns. Check for misspellings.\nThe name of one variable was misspelled, and therefore, the script could not find any non-zero values in the previous files when parsing them. Check for misspellings.\nIn general, when this happens, search the oldest file in which the error starts to appear and trace the specific script (Step 1/2/3/4/5) that generated the file with the wrong column. Search for misspellings in the specific Step.\nThe final step Step5_Add_pvalues.R produced an error at the end, and I don’t see a Merged_with_P_vals.csv file in the finalized_pileup folder.\nThe final line of the Step5_Add_pvalues.R script needs to be modified to include the output Merged_with_P_vals.csv file path.

The dsDNA is then transcribed into RNA using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (E2040S). The resulting unmodified RNA is cleaned up using the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (T2040S) and subsequently prepared for nanopore sequencing using the standard ONT Direct RNA library preparation kit.\nBefore starting the experiment.\nClean the bench with ethanol and RNaseZap.\nThaw VN Primer (VNP) (SQK-PCS109), Strand Switching Primer (SSP) (SQK-PCS109), dNTPs, and 5X RT buffer on ice.\nPerform the first strand, reverse transcription (RT), and strand-switching.\nIn a 0.2 mL PCR tube, prepare 100 ng of Poly(A)-selected RNA in 9 μL nuclease-free water.\nAdd 1 μL VNP (2 μM) and 1 μL dNTPs (10 μM) to the RNA, then gently flick the tube to mix and briefly spin down the sample on a benchtop centrifuge.\nIncubate at 65°C for 5 min and snap cool on ice for 5 min.\nIn a 1.5 mL DNA LoBind Eppendorf tube, prepare the strand-switching buffer by mixing the following reagents:\nAdd 8 μL of strand-switching buffer to the snap-cooled mRNA, then gently flick the tube to mix and briefly spin down the sample on a benchtop centrifuge.\nIncubate the reaction at 42°C for 2 min.\nAdd 1 μL of Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase, 1 × 10,000 units (200 U/μL) for a final total volume of 20 μL, then gently flick the tube to mix and briefly spin down the sample on a benchtop centrifuge.\nIncubate the sample using the following thermocycler protocol:\nPerform PCR amplification.\nPrepare 2 reactions in separate 0.2 mL PCR tubes at 25°C.\nAdd 5 μL reverse-transcribed RNA sample to a 0.2 mL PCR tube and add the following reagents:\nGently flick the tube to mix and briefly spin down the sample on a benchtop centrifuge.\nAmplify the RT product using the following cycling conditions:\nAdd 1 μL of NEB Exonuclease I directly to each PCR tube, then gently flick the tube to mix and briefly spin down the sample on a benchtop centrifuge.\nIncubate the reaction at 37°C for 15 min, followed by 80°C for 15 min for heat inactivation.\nCleanup the PCR product:\nPool the two reactions together in a clean 1.5 mL DNA LoBind Eppendorf tube.\nVortex the Sera-Mag beads and add 250 μL to the PCR product.\nGently mix by pipetting and incubate at ambient temperature for 10 min.\nBriefly spin down the mixture, then place the tube in a magnetic rack for 5 min to magnetically separate the beads.\nAspirate the supernatant to waste.\nWith the tube in the magnetic rack, gently add 1 mL of 70% ethanol.

If you have insufficient material—either for the IVT control or your Poly(A)-selected sample—you may increase the volume of RNA used in the RTA (Reverse Transcription Adapter) reaction to a maximum of 15 μL by following the table below. In such cases, do not add RCS (RNA Calibration Strand) to the RTA reaction as the RCS is optional according to the manufacturer’s protocol. This allows to replace the RCS volume with more RNA.\nDirect RNA sequencing library preparation is performed on the previously extracted and Poly(A) selected RNA following the\nThe updated ONT Direct RNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-R004) protocol for the new chemistry can be found here:\nAdjust the RTA reaction mix if needed:\nAdjust the reverse transcription mix as follows:\nBy eliminating nuclease-free water from the reverse transcription mix, you maintain a consistent final reaction volume of 38 μL (28 μL RTA + 10 μL RT mix). This approach allows you to accommodate a higher input RNA volume while preserving reaction efficiency. We successfully used this approach in the past.\n\nIn this section, we describe steps for analyzing DRS data. Processing of raw ONT sequencing data involves the use of several software tools, including the Guppy basecaller and the Minimap2 aligner. It is strongly recommended to install Conda and perform all analyses within dedicated Conda environments.\nTo facilitate the use of the protocol by people without an extensive computational background we also provide a quick guide on how to install miniconda3, create a conda environment, and install necessary software in it.\nInstall Miniconda using the following commands:\n#1. pull miniconda3 from anaconda.com\nwget --quiet https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n#2. check hash key of package\nsha256sum Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n#3. install miniconda3\nbash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /work/directory/<YOUR DIR>/SOFTWARE/miniconda3\n#4. source miniconda3 (if miniconda3 is active your terminal will show: (base) [<USER>@<NODE> <CURRENT DIR>])\nsource /<YOUR DIR>/miniconda3/bin/activate\nInstall minimap and samtools in a conda environment using the following commands:\n#required packages: samtools (v1.3.1) using htslib (v1.3.1)| minimap2 (v2.24)\n#1. create secondary environment for alignment\nconda create -n align2.24\n#2. activate|switch to secondary environment\nconda activate align2.24\n#3. install required packages\nconda install -c bioconda samtools\nconda install -c bioconda minimap2\n#4. return to (base)\nconda deactivate\nAll FAST5 files were output from MinKNOW onto the local hard drive and exported to the Northeastern University Discovery Cluster using the following command:\nscp <filename> <username>@xfer.discovery.neu.edu:/scratch/<username>\nBasecalling was performed on an NVIDIA A100 GPU using Guppy v6.4.2, and the rna_r9.4.1_70bps_hac_prom model with the following command:\n/<PATH TO GUPPY FOLDER>/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecaller -i /<YOUR FAST5 FOLDER>/ -s /<OUTPUT FOLDER>/ -c /<PATH TO GUPPY FOLDER>/ont-guppy/data/rna_r9.4.1_70bps_hac_prom.cfg -x cuda:all:100% -r --u_substitution\n/<PATH TO GUPPY FOLDER>/ont-guppy/bin/guppy_basecaller -i /<YOUR FAST5 FOLDER>/ -s /<OUTPUT FOLDER>/ -c /<PATH TO GUPPY FOLDER>/ont-guppy/data/rna_r9.4.1_70bps_hac_prom.cfg -x cuda:all:100% -r --u_substitution --resume\nWith the following commands, we provide one example of Dorado usage with Modified basecalling enabled for pseudouridine (--modified-bases pseU tag), and how to convert the raw unaligned bam file to FASTQ format retaining the base modification annotations (-TMM,ML,MM,Ml tags).\n#basecalling\n/<PATH TO DORADO FOLDER>/bin/dorado basecaller /<PATH TO DORADO MODELS FOLDER>/rna004_130bps_hac@v5.1.0 /<PATH TO YOUR POD5 FOLDER> --modified-bases pseU --emit-moves > /<OUTPUT FOLDER>/\n#unaligned bam to FASTQ conversion\nsamtools fastq -@ 64 -TMM,ML,MM,Ml /<PATH TO DORADO’S OUTPUT RAW_BAM FOLDER>/ > /<OUTPUT FASTQ>/\nThe FASTQ files were then merged into one file using the following command:\ncat /<YOUR FASTQ FOLDER>/∗.fastq > merged.fastq\nAlignment was performed on the merged FASTQ file using minimap 2.24.\n#1.source your conda environment\nsource /<YOUR DIR>/miniconda3/bin/activate\n#2.activate the environment in which minimap2 and samtools are installed\nconda activate align2.24\n$REFGENOME=/<PATH TO REFERENGE .fasta GENOME>/\n$MERGEDFQ=/PATH TO MERGED .fq/\n$SAM_UNF=/<PATH TO OUTPUT UNFILTERED SAM>/\n$SAM=/<PATH TO OUTPUT SAM>/\n$BAM=/<PATH TO OUTPUT BAM FILE>/\n#3.run alignment steps\nminimap2 -t 32 -ax splice -uf -k 14 $REFGENOME $MERGEDFQ | samtools sort -o $SAM_UNF -T reads.tmp\nsamtools view -h -F 4 -F 256 -F 2048 $SAM_UNF > $SAM\nsamtools view -S -b $SAM > $BAM\nsamtools index $BAM\n\nIn this section, we describe the steps for detecting pseudouridine sites transcriptome-wide. The pseudouridine detection is performed with Mod-\nMod-p ID is divided in five scripts. The description of key functions of each script is described below.\nStep1_PileUp.R script reads aligned and indexed sequencing data from BAM files corresponding to both direct RNA and IVT samples. The script generates distinct pileup summaries for both the sample and IVT, which include counts of nucleotide occurrences at each positions.\nStep2_Merge_replicate_pileups.R script reads the pileup files generated from the previous step, each corresponding to a different replicate and IVT, and combines the pileup data across replicates in one single merged file. In this way, each position detected in the sequencing data includes the summaries from all the replicates and the IVT.\nStep3_add_kmer.R annotates each candidate psi site with their corresponding k-mer sequence (k=5). As psi sites are modified uridine (U) sites, the code filters the dataset to retain only sites where the reference base in the genome is a T, which corresponds to U in RNA. For each site, the script uses the reference genome to extract the 5-mer sequence centered around the site.\nStep4_IVT_Kmer_Analysis.R reads the file containing the U positions and associated k-mers and calculates the frequency of each unique k-mer across the IVT. This allows to establish a baseline k-mer distribution in the IVT sample and find over/underrepresented k-mers in the unmodified RNA. This file is used as a lookup table in the next step, as it provides the expected basecalling error (U-to-C mismatch) for each specific sequence context.\nStep5_Add_pvalues.R calculates the p-values for each U position to quantify the likelihood of observed modification being statistically significant. The p-value is calculated by comparing the U-to-C mismatch of the direct sample to the IVT control. This step produces the final Merged_with_P_vals.csv file, which contains the pileup information, the k-mers and the p-values for each U site found across replicates in the sample and IVT libraries.\nMove all the .bam and corresponding indexed .bam files (.bai) obtained from the preprocessing step into one folder.\nClone or download the ZIP folder at\nUnzip the folder and open the PsiNanopore-main/Pvalue-Pipeline folder.\nOpen Step1_PileUp.R script.\nFollow the instructions found in the INSTRUCTIONS_Pvalue-pipeline.pdf document to modify the relevant pieces of code:\nWrite short names for your libraries (if you have replicates, use numbers to distinguish them, i.e., DRS1, DRS2) in the “replicate.name” field of the meta.data.df variable.\nProvide the names of the bam files moved to the same folder at step 42 following the same order as the “replicate.name” field.\nProvide the path of the reference genome fasta file in hg38.fa variable.

We usually name this IVT_kmer_Analysis.csv.\nCreate a folder named finalized_pileup inside the init_gene_pileup folder.\nProvide the path of the finalized_pileup folder in the merged.Uonly.Pileup.out.dir variable and include the name of the file in which to store the results.

We usually call this file Merged_with_P_vals.csv and save it under the finalized_pileup folder created at step 48c.\nRun the script.\n\nIn this section, we describe how to perform differential analysis on the untreated and RA-differentiated libraries described in Fanari et al., where we applied Mod-p ID to untreated and RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. This allowed us to determine the U-to-C mismatch, read coverage and p-values at each U position (T in the genomic reference) using the IVT library as a control to establish the expected background in the unmodified RNA. We then applied a series of filtering steps to define high-confidence modification sites. The filtering steps, described in the original paper and in the next steps of this protocol, took into consideration occupancy levels (U-to-C %mm >10 in the sample and U-to-C %mm <10 in the IVT;\nIVT filtration criteria to select modified sites in DRS libraries can be visualized with IGV\n(A) IGV screenshot shows a valid psi-site with a U-to-C %mm <10 in the IVT library, as shown by the clean (gray) bands.\n(B) IGV screenshot shows an example of a candidate psi-site we exclude as the U-to-C %mm >10 in the IVT library, as shown by a colored band.\nAll the code described in this section can be found at the following link:\nLoad the Merged_with_P_vals.csv file in Rstudio.\nDRS<-read.csv(“path_to_Merged_with_P_vals.csv file”)\nFilter the Merged_with_P_vals.csv file.\nFilter and keep only significant psi-sites p<0.001.

For your sample RNA sequencing (DRS) libraries, starting with 500 ng of poly(A)-selected RNA routinely yields sufficient sequencing output for robust downstream analysis.\nIn terms of computational analysis, successful pipeline execution should result in a table of statistically significant ψ-sites. These are derived by comparing mismatch patterns between DRS and IVT datasets. The final CSV file used in this pipeline is outputted by Step5_Add_pvalues.R. Although the previous steps produce output CSV tables, these are used by the Mod-p ID pipeline and we don’t use them in the next filtration steps.\nThe CSV file contains: the k-mer centered at each uridine site detected in each direct replicate and the IVT library; the read coverage (number of T and C nucleotides and the total number of reads detected at each position) for each uridine site detected in each direct replicate and the IVT; the U-to-C mismatch percentage calculated for each uridine site detected in each direct replicate and IVT; the p-value calculated for each uridine site detected in each direct replicate and the IVT.\nIn IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) plots, true positive psi-sites are typically characterized by elevated U-to-C mismatches in the DRS sample and negligible mismatches in the IVT sample, which lacks modifications. The IGV traces can be visualized using the same aligned and indexed BAM files used as input by Step1_PileUp.R in Mod-p ID. We use IGV traces to manually inspect positions and ensure that the IVT traces have negligible mismatch to the genomic reference.\nTo minimize false positives, we apply a stringent filter: we retain only those sites where the U-to-C mismatch in the IVT library is <10%. This threshold helps ensure that retained sites are not sequence variants or artifacts due to problematic k-mers. Importantly, this allows the inclusion of lower-coverage sites, as the low IVT mismatch gives confidence in their validity. A typical output includes several hundred high-confidence psi-sites per library, depending on coverage and cell type.\nThis protocol, while robust and reproducible, presents several limitations that users should be aware of. Nanopore-based detection of RNA modifications, including pseudouridine, is inherently noisy. The Mod-\nThis method detects the presence/absence and relative occupancy differences of ψ-sites but does not yield precise stoichiometry. For researchers interested in quantifying the fraction of molecules modified at a site, we recommend using synthetic RNA strands and dedicated quantification tools like ModQuant.\nResults may be affected by differences in ONT chemistries (e.g., RNA002 vs. RNA004) and platforms (e.g., MinION vs PromethION), especially in terms of read depth and coverage. Users must account for these differences when comparing datasets.\nThe accuracy of detection relies heavily on having a matched IVT library. If an IVT control for the same cell type is unavailable, results may suffer in accuracy. Public IVT datasets can be used, but users should interpret findings cautiously if there are sequence or expression-level mismatches.\nDifficulty isolating only the aqueous phase during RNA extraction, leading to contamination from the interphase.\nConsider using Phasemaker Tubes to simplify phase separation and reduce contamination. Detailed usage instructions are available here:\nWhen running a step of Mod-\n\nIf an error occurs at the beginning of one of the steps, check if you created all the folders needed to run the script and ensure the spellings are correct and match the names provided in the script.\nAll the input/output/working folders are:\nIf the code stops without issues with the folders, check the spelling of bam files and folder names.\nIf the code stops without issues with folder creation/bam files, check the reference fasta and gff3 files.\nThis type of error could also be generated by misspelling the replicate’s names. The replicate’s names chosen at step 45.a.i. need to be the same and used as suffixes in all necessary variables with the same spelling specified at 45.a.i. point of the Mod-p ID protocol.\nThe files created by Mod-p ID contain the same values copy-pasted in multiple columns or only zeroes in a column.\n\nThe names of two different replicates were misspelled in one of the variables. Therefore, the same values were copied in two different columns. Check for misspellings.\nThe name of one variable was misspelled, and therefore, the script could not find any non-zero values in the previous files when parsing them. Check for misspellings.\nIn general, when this happens, search the oldest file in which the error starts to appear and trace the specific script (Step 1/2/3/4/5) that generated the file with the wrong column.
