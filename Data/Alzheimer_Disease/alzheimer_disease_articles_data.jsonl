Under SI conditions, mice exhibited both emotional disturbances and social cognitive impairments, with these effects being most pronounced in APP/PS1 mice. Intranasal OXT intervention effectively counteracted the accelerated AD progression induced by SI, a process associated with dynamic modulation of the OXT system, which may explain the observed behavioral and pathological changes. Our study elucidates the multifaceted impact of SI on AD‐vulnerable individuals, providing potential diagnostic insights. Importantly, our findings indicate that OXT may have both protective and restorative effects on central and peripheral systems in socially isolated AD model mice, providing a rationale for future translational research.\nThe significance of social interaction is underscored by studies identifying SI and loneliness as risk factors for adverse health outcomes and increased mortality [\nSI accelerates Aβ accumulation in the PFC. Positron emission tomography imaging studies have demonstrated a significant correlation between Aβ burden and feelings of loneliness [\nOXT plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD, particularly in regulating social interaction and emotional balance in neurodegenerative diseases. In our experiment, SI conditions did not significantly affect the number of OXT neurons in APP/PS1 mice, likely due to the distinct physiological responses of different neuron types to environmental and pathological factors. Studies on AD patients suggest that reduced activation, rather than loss, of OXT neurons may occur in AD brains [\nThere is an urgent need for cost‐effective, low‐side‐effect interventions to prevent the onset and progression of\nFollowing intranasal OXT intervention, OXTR expression was significantly downregulated. This discovery suggests that OXT exerts regulatory effects on the OXT system, potentially mediating immunomodulatory effects on the organism. Furthermore, the suppression of abnormal microglial proliferation in the PFC brain region further supports this hypothesis. Previous studies have shown that intravenous injection of OXT, which specifically binds to pathologically upregulated OXTR, can reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines and alleviate AD pathological damage by blocking the ERK/p38 MAPK and COX‐2/iNOS NF‐κB signaling pathways [\nOXT can reduce the production of pro‐inflammatory factors, mitigate oxidative stress responses, and protect intestinal barrier integrity [\nThe regulation of emotional and social behaviors by OXT may represent an effective strategy for delaying AD progression. Future research should further explore the effects of different OXT administration methods and dosages to optimize intervention protocols. Neuropsychiatric disorders, as early warning indicators, play a critical role in the onset and progression of AD. Our findings not only reveal the detrimental effects of SI on AD but also provide novel insights into early intervention strategies.

Under SI conditions, mice exhibited both emotional disturbances and social cognitive impairments, with these effects being most pronounced in APP/PS1 mice. Intranasal OXT intervention effectively counteracted the accelerated AD progression induced by SI, a process associated with dynamic modulation of the OXT system, which may explain the observed behavioral and pathological changes. Our study elucidates the multifaceted impact of SI on AD‐vulnerable individuals, providing potential diagnostic insights. Importantly, our findings indicate that OXT may have both protective and restorative effects on central and peripheral systems in socially isolated AD model mice, providing a rationale for future translational research.\nThe significance of social interaction is underscored by studies identifying SI and loneliness as risk factors for adverse health outcomes and increased mortality [\nSI accelerates Aβ accumulation in the PFC.

In our experiment, SI conditions did not significantly affect the number of OXT neurons in APP/PS1 mice, likely due to the distinct physiological responses of different neuron types to environmental and pathological factors. Studies on AD patients suggest that reduced activation, rather than loss, of OXT neurons may occur in AD brains [\nThere is an urgent need for cost‐effective, low‐side‐effect interventions to prevent the onset and progression of\nFollowing intranasal OXT intervention, OXTR expression was significantly downregulated. This discovery suggests that OXT exerts regulatory effects on the OXT system, potentially mediating immunomodulatory effects on the organism. Furthermore, the suppression of abnormal microglial proliferation in the PFC brain region further supports this hypothesis. Previous studies have shown that intravenous injection of OXT, which specifically binds to pathologically upregulated OXTR, can reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines and alleviate AD pathological damage by blocking the ERK/p38 MAPK and COX‐2/iNOS NF‐κB signaling pathways [\nOXT can reduce the production of pro‐inflammatory factors, mitigate oxidative stress responses, and protect intestinal barrier integrity [\nThe regulation of emotional and social behaviors by OXT may represent an effective strategy for delaying AD progression. Future research should further explore the effects of different OXT administration methods and dosages to optimize intervention protocols. Neuropsychiatric disorders, as early warning indicators, play a critical role in the onset and progression of AD. Our findings not only reveal the detrimental effects of SI on AD but also provide novel insights into early intervention strategies. These results further expand the therapeutic potential of OXT, highlighting its significance in treating related disorders.\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committees of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nData S1.", "topic": "Alzheimer_Disease"}

Notably, PART patients show a higher degree of tau hyperphosphorylation in the entorhinal cortex (EC) than AD, yet the molecular mechanisms driving Aβ‐independent tau hyperphosphorylation in PART remain poorly understood. Herein, through transcriptomic profiling of postmortem EC tissues and in vitro and in vivo functional validation, the present study identifies protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) as a critical driver of tau hyperphosphorylation. Mechanistically, PRMT3‐mediated tau hyperphosphorylation is dependent on asymmetric dimethylation of histone H4 at arginine 3 (H4R3me2a), which upregulates miR‐448. Elevated miR‐448 specifically targets and suppresses IGF1R, leading to downstream GSK3β activation and subsequent tau hyperphosphorylation through PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling.

The results showed that the miR‐448 mimic significantly increased tau phosphorylation, while the miR‐448 inhibitor led to a marked reduction in tau phosphorylation (Figure\nBased on the experimental findings, we propose that the PRMT3/H4R3me2a/miR‐448/IGF1R/PI3K/AKT/GSK3β axis plays a pivotal role in regulating tau phosphorylation. Although this signaling pathway is extensive and may raise concerns about specificity—given that PRMT3 methylates substrates beyond H4R3, miR‐448 targets multiple genes, and IGF1R could influence tau phosphorylation through alternative pathways—our results underscore its specificity and functional relevance. To validate the pathway's specificity, we first treated Neuro2a and SH‐SY5Y cells with SGC707, that broadly impacts asymmetric dimethylation of all PRMT3 substrates. On this background, transfection of the miR‐448 mimic significantly attenuated SGC707's protective effect against tau hyperphosphorylation (Figure\nTo further explore whether PRMT3 inhibition has potential for treating tau hyperphosphorylation and the resulting neuronal dysfunction, we used PRMT3 specific inhibitor SGC707 to treat in vitro tauopathy cell models induced by okadaic acid (OA). XY‐1, a close analogue of SGC707 that is completely inactive against PRMT3, was used as a negative control. After induction by OA, SH‐SY5Y cells exhibited tau hyperphosphorylation at S202/T205, T181, S404, and S396 residues.

Mice injected with SGC707 entered the novel arm more frequently and spent more time in the novel arm during the Y‐maze test (Figure\nThe tauopathies represent a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the aberrant aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. This group includes primary tauopathies, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick disease, frontotemporal dementia, and PART, as well as secondary tauopathies, including AD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\nGiven the complexity of the human brain, studying tau pathology based on human brain tissue provides essential insights. However, the rarity of primary tauopathies, such as CBD, PSP, and Pick disease, presents substantial challenges in obtaining sufficient brain samples for research. Although AD is the most extensively studied tauopathy, its classification as a secondary tauopathy complicates efforts to clarify the independent mechanisms of tau hyperphosphorylation due to significant interactions with coexisting pathologies, particularly Aβ.\nDisease duration is a key variable in studying molecular mechanisms based on human samples. Both PART and AD are slow‐progressing diseases, with pathological and molecular changes likely occurring early and persisting for years. Given the challenges in accurately determining the specific disease duration for donors, we used Braak staging and ADNC scores as proxies to assess pathological severity. This approach helps reduce the confounding effects potentially arising from disease duration mismatches. Our study focuses on the mechanism underlying the regulation of tau phosphorylation level. By selecting samples free from other neurological conditions, with comparable neuropathological changes, and rigorously matching variables such as age and sex in the experimental design, we effectively minimized the impact of confounding factors.\nIn the present study, we focused on the EC region of PART patients, as it is the first brain region where tau hyperphosphorylation appears.\nH4R3me2a is one of the key modifications catalyzed by PRMT3, which is generally considered a mark associated with transcriptional activation.\nTranscriptional and epigenetic factors are key regulators of microRNA expression. For instance, PRMT5 represses the transcription of miR‐99 family by symmetrical dimethylation of histone H4R3 (H4R3me2s).\nPost‐translational modifications (PTMs) are key regulators of tau behavior and function, encompassing phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, glycation, nitration, polyamination, and SUMOylation.\nIn PS19 mice, we observed marked gliosis and elevated levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, hallmark indicators of neuroinflammation,\nHowever, there were limitations in our study. In this study, postmortem interval (PMI) was not prioritized as a criterion for the inclusion of human brain tissue samples. This decision was based on our previous study, which utilized the same EC transcriptomic dataset as the current study and demonstrated, through PCA, that PMI contributed minimally to transcriptomic variation.\nIn summary, we identified PRMT3 as a critical driver of tau hyperphosphorylation in PART. This study elucidates a new epigenetic mechanism in which PRMT3 directly mediates the asymmetric dimethylation of H4R3 (H4R3me2a) at the promoter of MIR448, leading to increased miR‐448 expression. Elevated miR‐448 suppresses the expression of its target gene IGF1R, resulting in the dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway, ultimately driving GSK3β activation and tau hyperphosphorylation. Notably, inhibition of PRMT3 with SGC707 significantly reduced tau pathology and restored neuronal function both in vitro and in vivo (\nThe mechanistic scheme of PRMT3 facilitates tau hyperphosphorylation in PART.

Elevated miR‐448 suppresses the expression of its target gene IGF1R, resulting in the dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway, ultimately driving GSK3β activation and tau hyperphosphorylation. Notably, inhibition of PRMT3 with SGC707 significantly reduced tau pathology and restored neuronal function both in vitro and in vivo (\nThe mechanistic scheme of PRMT3 facilitates tau hyperphosphorylation in PART.

As of February 2025, brexpiprazole for this indication is approved only in a limited number of countries, that is, the United States, Canada, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, and Japan. Brexpiprazole is an antipsychotic that acts as a partial agonist at serotonin 5‐hydroxytryptamine\n\n\n\n\nBrexpiprazole has demonstrated efficacy and safety in a pivotal phase 2/3 study (randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 10‐week treatment with brexpiprazole 1 or 2 mg/day),\nThe Cohen–Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the primary endpoint in the pivotal study in Japan, is a clinically validated scale that quantifies the frequency of 29 agitated behaviors during a period of 2 weeks\nThe purpose of these exploratory analyses was, using NPI and NPI‐NH, to evaluate BPSD symptoms in brexpiprazole‐treated patients with AAD and its impact on caregiver distress, which will provide useful data for better understanding of patient symptoms and caregiver distress.\nThe detailed methodology has previously been reported.\nThis study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (\nNPI and NPI‐NH were used to evaluate the 12 domains of BPSD by ratings of a caregiver. The 12 domains were as follows: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behavior, sleep and nighttime behavior disorders, and appetite and eating disorders. Each domain was scored by a 4 point scale of frequency (1: rarely, 2: sometimes, 3: often, 4: very often) multiplied by a 3 point scale of severity (1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe). NPI and NPI‐NH also included questions to evaluate how much distress each symptom caused a caregiver. Each domain was scored by a 6 point scale of caregiver distress and occupational disruptiveness, respectively (0: not at all, 1: minimally, 2: mildly, 3: moderately, 4: severely, 5: very severely or extremely). NPI was used for patients at home, whereas NPI‐NH was used for patients in a hospital or care facility. Hereafter, NPI and NPI‐NH were combined into and referred to as NPI. The areas of patient symptoms and caregiver distress/disruptiveness were distinguished with or without “‐Distress”; that is, NPI and NPI‐Distress, respectively. A decrease of score means an improvement of patient symptoms or a reduction of caregiver distress. These scores were assessed at baseline, Week 4, and Week 10. It should be noted that each domain of the NPI individual scores and NPI‐Distress individual scores was 12 points and 5 points at a maximum, respectively, and that the maximum scores of NPI total score and NPI‐Distress total score were 144 points (12 points × 12 domains) and 60 points (5 points × 12 domains), respectively. These settings mean that room for improvement was smaller in the NPI‐Distress score than in the NPI score.\nAccording to the overview of the 2020 patient survey by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the average length of hospitalization of patients with Alzheimer's disease was 273 days.\nThe analyses of NPI and NPI‐Distress were performed by mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM), based on the assumption of missing at random, using an observed cases dataset.

NPI and NPI‐Distress were completed by investigators, based on information from caregivers (to minimize the influences caused by different caregivers, the protocol defined the requirements for setting a primary caregiver, such as available at least 4 days/week and 4 hours/day for patient observation, etc.). In both of NPI and NPI‐Distress scores, the individual scores at baseline vary from < 1.0 to > 7.0. In the case of lower scores, it is unknown whether brexpiprazole had no efficacy or if there was no room for improvement. As the endpoints of NPI and NPI‐Distress were exploratory ones, statistical analyses were conducted in a non‐confirmatory manner and the results were presented descriptively. For the missing mechanism, we hypothesized missing at random, but if this hypothesis was not valid, the results could be biased. Among various background factors, such as age, sex, medical care category (inpatient or outpatient [home or care facility]), prior use of antipsychotics, and so on, there may be factors that influence efficacy results as confounders. For NPI and NPI‐Distress, changes in the total and individual scores from baseline were evaluated up to Week 10, and thus the results over a longer period are unknown. The recurrence of symptoms and its impact on caregiver distress after the cessation of brexpiprazole treatment also remain unknown. This study was conducted in Japanese patients, and therefore caution is necessary when extrapolating the results to other races.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that brexpiprazole treatment for AAD is beneficial to improve patient BPSD and to reduce caregiver distress.\nYu Nakamura has received speakers’ honoraria, manuscript fee, research support, or scholarship donation from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd., Viatris Pharmaceutical K.K., Eisai Co., Ltd., Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Teikoku Pharmaceutical K.K., Kowa Company Ltd., Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Towa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., MSD K.K., Biogen Japan Ltd., Daiichi Sankyo Company Ltd, and EA Pharma Co., Ltd.

According to the Alzheimer's Association\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the options for\nIn recent years, multiple blood‐based biomarkers (BBMs) have become available as promising and accessible alternatives for detecting AD pathology.\nTo address this gap, the Alzheimer's Association has convened a panel of clinical and subject‐matter experts, along with guideline methodologists with expertise in the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This collaborative effort has resulted in two complementary manuscripts: the present CPG, which provides formal recommendations, and a separate systematic review that presents the underlying evidence base.\nThe guideline was developed in accordance with the AGREE II Reporting Checklist\nThe chairs of the guideline panel were selected by the leadership of the Alzheimer's Association. The panel was composed of 11 members: clinical neurologists (S.Pal., M.S.‐C., S.S., D.G.), geriatricians (H.W., H.O.), nurse practitioner (L.A.), physician assistant (M.P.), and subject‐matter experts, some with clinical expertise (C.T., H.Z., T.K.). Panelists were of diverse geographic distribution and years of clinical experience; six were based in North America, four in Europe, and two held dual affiliations in both regions. To ensure the integrity of the guideline development process, the panel elected to replace one of the co‐chairs when a change in their employment status introduced a potential conflict of interest that would have been challenging to mitigate (see the Acknowledgments section).\nThree guideline methodologists (L.A.K., S.Pah., M.P.T.) oversaw all methodological aspects of the guideline development, including collaboration on the development and execution of a search strategy with a medical librarian (M.B.M.), and two (S.Pah., L.A.K.) oversaw the identification and synthesis of scientific evidence and the evidence‐to‐decision (EtD) process for the clinical question. The Alzheimer's Association's staff, who also served as subject‐matter experts (R.M.E., S.M., S.Pah., M.P.T.), oversaw all administrative and logistical aspects related to the guideline panel, including the managment of conflicts of interest.\nThis guideline's primary target audience includes specialists involved in the diagnostic evaluation of cognitive impairment in specialized care settings. A specialist in this context is defined as a healthcare provider, typically, but not exclusively, in neurology, psychiatry, or geriatrics, who spends at least 25% of their clinical practice time caring for adults with cognitive impairment or dementia. Not all clinicians in these fields are dementia specialists, and providers in other areas of practice may identify as a specialist based on their specific knowledge and training. Specialists are proficient in assessing, diagnosing and treating cognitive disorders, understanding and interpreting the results of brain imaging, CSF, and BBM tests, and clearly communicating the results of the aforementioned tests and their implications to patients and families.\nThis guideline is intended to inform clinical decision‐making, support the development of standards of care, guide laboratory practices, and assist clinicians in selecting appropriate BBM tests for individual patients. In addition, it may help inform the use of BBMs and their incorporation in clinical trial outcomes or decisions in clinical trials with adaptive design.\nThe secondary target audience includes individuals affected by MCI or dementia, their caregivers, policy‐makers involved in dementia care and healthcare decision‐making, and laboratory medicine specialists involved in using BBMs.\nThe panel identified two key clinical questions that warrant recommendation in this first iteration of the guideline:\nShould a BBM test be incorporated as a triaging test to determine the presence or absence of AD pathology in the diagnostic workup of individuals with cognitive impairment (including those with MCI or dementia) presenting for specialized care for memory disorders?\nShould a BBM test serve as a substitute for CSF analysis or amyloid PET as a confirmatory test to determine the presence or absence of AD pathology in the diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia) presenting for specialized care for memory disorders?\nA triaging test refers to a test in which a negative result rules out AD pathology with high probability, whereas a positive result should be confirmed using another method, such as CSF AD biomarkers or amyloid PET.\nA confirmatory test refers to a test for which a negative result rules out AD pathology, and a positive test confirms AD pathology with a high probability.\nInput on these questions was gathered during the 2024 Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), where experts in the field provided insights to inform the development of this guideline.\nThis guideline is not intended to serve as a comprehensive clinical pathway or appropriate use recommendations for the broader diagnostic workup or treatment decision‐making in individuals with MCI or dementia. It does not address the use of BBMs for screening purposes, use in non‐specialty settings, or use in people with no cognitive concerns or only subjective memory impairment.\nThe population and setting for this guideline include individuals with objective cognitive impairment (i.e., MCI or dementia) presenting to specialized care settings due to cognitive complaints. Objective cognitive impairment requires objective evidence of cognitive deficits detected by cognitive assessment tools and/or medical examination and provider assessment. It does not include subjective cognitive decline, in which the patient perceives changes in memory or other cognitive domains but performs as expected on cognitive testing, and a trained provider does not detect notable deficits (e.g., aphasia, disinhibition, executive dysfunction) in assessment.\nThe panel developed recommendations for BBM testing only in individuals with objective cognitive impairment who have already completed a comprehensive clinical workup. This guideline does not extend to cognitively unimpaired individuals, given the current lack of clinical relevance for BBM use in this population. The panel made the a priori decision not to use data for cognitively impaired and unimpaired populations combined to inform recommendations to minimize indirectness and because test performance could appear more favorable in populations with a bimodal distribution of brain amyloid (i.e., individuals with very low [cognitively unimpaired] or very high [AD‐like dementia] brain amyloid levels).\nThis work focuses on specialized care settings, which include practices where a memory disorder specialist (defined in Section\nThe panel determined that primary care and specialized care settings merit separate CPG processes for four main reasons. First, among patients presenting with cognitive impairment, we expect a different prevalence of AD pathology in primary care versus specialized care settings. Different population prevalence means that the same test will have different negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV), which could alter panel recommendations. Second, pretest probability must be considered in setting acceptable thresholds for sensitivity and specificity, and evidence suggests that pretest probability for AD pathology is more accurate when determined in specialist than in non‐specialist settings.\nThe panel was mindful that many BBM tests measuring the same analyte (e.g., p‐tau217) utilize different technology or utilize different antibodies and can achieve different performance characteristics. Therefore, for this guideline, a BBM test is defined as the combination of a BBM (analyte) and the technology used to measure it (e.g., specific immunoassay or mass spectrometry method). For this initial iteration of the guideline, the panel identified plasma assays for phosphorylated‐tau (p‐tau) and Aβ, measuring the following analytes: p‐tau217, the ratio of p‐tau217 to non‐p‐tau217 ×100 (expressed as a percentage of p‐tau217 [%p‐tau217]), p‐tau181, p‐tau231, and Aβ42/Aβ40. To ensure the systematic review was both feasible and clinically relevant, we focused on a limited number of BBMs rather than attempting a broad meta‐analysis across all possible available BBM tests. The panel thus prioritized BBMs most commonly used as indicators of brain amyloid, excluding markers like glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL). We also chose to analyze tests that measure single analytes rather than ratios, unless the ratio included a reference value of the same protein type (i.e., Aβ42/Aβ40). Based on available evidence and head‐to‐head comparison data, including Round Robin results,\nDespite analyzing the specific assays/analytes in the systematic review, the panel opted for a brand‐agnostic, blinded, performance‐based approach for the guideline's recommendations. This approach ensures the guideline's credibility, durability, and actionability. It protects the guideline from perceived bias, reduces misalignment with recent advances, and provides clinicians with meaningful direction. By linking the CPG to our systematic review, we will be able to ensure ongoing relevance without requiring frequent changes to the recommendations themselves.\nThe authors acknowledge that several BBM tests on the market have no published data meeting the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the systematic review; we encourage the manufacturers of these tests to publish evidence on the diagnostic test accuracy of their tests in peer‐reviewed journals.\nThis guideline has been informed by a corresponding systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy, published separately; please refer to that publication for a more detailed description of the systematic review methodology.\nBriefly, the following databases were searched from 2019 through November 3, 2024: PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Methodologists conducted study selection, data extraction, risk of bias, and certainty assessments, and statisticians performed data analysis. Details regarding the literature search strategy can be found in the\nRaw data were sought, including the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), sensitivity (Sn), and specificity (Sp), at the Youden index cutoff. Data were sourced from (1) published studies, (2) author‐provided information when missing from studies, and (3) Sn and Sp associated with the Youden index derived from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using WebPlotDigitizer\nMeta‐analyses of diagnostic test accuracy were conducted for each BBM test to calculate pooled Sn and Sp. The main meta‐analysis examined single cutoffs based on Youden's index. Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the data based on reported versus missing data: (1) reported data only using any cutoff for the index test, (2) reported data using any cutoff for the index test plus data derived from curves at Youden's index when data was missing, (3) fixing Sp cutoff at 75% for triaging, and (4) fixing Sn cutoff at 90% for confirmatory testing.\nThe guideline panel assessed the certainty of the supporting evidence and formulated the recommendations according to the GRADE approach.\nThe panel decided not to make recommendations for or against specific tests; this decision reflects several considerations, including variability in how tests are developed, validated, and implemented across laboratories. Furthermore, manufacturers and laboratories do not typically rely on meta‐analyses to determine test cutoffs for abnormality, and some are even recommending two cutoff approaches. These inconsistencies further support the panel's position that ranking or endorsing specific tests is premature at this time. Instead, test accuracy data and accuracy judgments reported in this guideline are meant to serve as a resource for clinicians implementing the recommendations to aid them in choosing which test(s) to order.\nThe panel aligned clinical thresholds for acceptable accuracy of BBM tests based on what clinicians in real‐world settings would find acceptable and used recent expert opinion as a starting point for that discussion.\nA given patient's pretest probability for AD pathology will vary according to clinical presentation, age, and known risk factors.\nBecause Youden's index cutoff is not always an optimal combination of Sn and Sp, we supplemented with analyses of fixed sensitivity at 90% and fixed specificity at 75% when data were available.\nThe EtD framework was used to translate evidence summaries into practice recommendations.\nDefinitions for interpreting the certainty of the evidence and implementing strong versus conditional recommendations\nNon‐systematic literature searches, along with panel opinion and experience, were used to inform the research evidence for EtD factors as needed.\nMethodologists worked with health economists to summarize published evidence on the cost and cost‐effectiveness of implementing BBMs in specialized care settings. Publicly available sources were used to compare the prices of commercially available BBM tests. A non‐systematic literature review was conducted to identify peer‐reviewed studies assessing the cost‐effectiveness of BBM tests in the diagnostic workup of suspected AD.\nInput from the Association National Early‐Stage Advisory Group (ESAG) made up of patients with early‐stage AD, internal and external collaborative parties, and feedback from a public comment period also informed the final recommendations.\nA draft version of the recommendations was made publicly available, and all feedback submitted during the public comment period (May 12 to May 23) was reviewed by the methods team and the panel. Comments that fell within the scope of the guideline questions and were supported by the available evidence were considered for incorporation into the final guidance. To promote transparency and acknowledge collaborative party contributions, all de‐identified comments, where possible, will be made publicly accessible on the Alzheimer's Association Website\nThis guideline is intended to serve as a regularly updated document and the associated systematic review will be regularly updated as new evidence emerges through the MAGICapp platform\nThese recommendations are designed to support clinicians, patients, caregivers, policy‐makers, and healthcare decision‐makers in making evidence‐informed decisions, specifically regarding which BBM test(s) to use and whether it/they should be used as a triaging or confirmatory test for AD pathology in specialized care settings. The recommendations are not meant to restrict, limit, delay, or deny clinical use, insurance coverage, or patient access to biomarker testing when deemed appropriate by a qualified healthcare provider. Furthermore, these recommendations do not substitute for clinical judgment nor encompass all possible considerations in the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation of AD. We advise clinicians to exercise discretion and adapt their approach based on individual patient circumstances and emerging evidence.\nThe panel formulated two recommendations and one good practice statement for the use of BBM tests in the diagnostic workup of patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized care. These conditional recommendations favor the use of BBM tests and offer acceptable minimum diagnostic test accuracy for triaging and confirmatory tests (Table\nRecommendations and remarks for the use of BBM tests in patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized care\nShould a BBM test be incorporated as a\n\nIn patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized memory‐care, the panel suggests\n\n\nShould a BBM test serve as a substitute for CSF analysis or amyloid PET as a\n\nIn patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized memory‐care, the panel suggests using a\n\n\nPlease see the associated systematic review\n\nWhen shared decision‐making discussions with the patient finds that there would be low utility in knowing whether AD pathology is present. The utility of a test depends partly on patient preferences and can be related to diagnostic or prognostic value, or if the test result informs a treatment decision. Some patients may only wish to know whether AD pathology is present if that knowledge informs treatment, but other patients may find utility regardless of treatment options.\nPatients with obvious modifiable or temporary conditions that are likely to account for the patient's cognitive impairment.\nPatients with limited life expectancy, as the clinical significance and prognosis of AD pathology are not well‐defined in these populations.\nPatients with a history of conditions that can affect the brain and that may impact levels of a given BBM in ways that have not been well‐studied (e.g., neurocysticercosis, HIV, history of chemotherapy or radiation, chronic traumatic encephalopathy).\nPatients with medical conditions that may affect the levels of a given BBM (e.g., acute brain injury, severe chronic kidney disease, ALS).\nPatients taking certain medications that may impact levels of a given BBM (e.g., neprilysin inhibitors, drugs that disrupt the blood‐brain barrier).\nAbbreviation: AD, Alzheimer's disease; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; BBM, blood‐based biomarker; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; PET, positron emission tomography.\nForty‐nine\nList of assay/analyte combinations studied in the systematic review.\nWashU\nAmyloid MS\nPrecivity\nUniversity of Gothenburg (UGOT)\nSimoa, Quanterix 4plexE\nSimoa, Quanterix single plexes\nSimoa, Quanterix Neuro 3‐plex A kit\nLumipulse\nElecsys\nHISCL, Sysmex\nLilly assay, Meso Scale Discovery (MSD)\nS‐PLEX, MSD\nSimoa, Quanterix p‐tau‐181 Advantage Kit\nSimoa, Quanterix 4plexE\nSimoa, Quanterix UGOT\nLumipulse\nSimoa, ADx Neurosciences\nElecsys, Roche\nWashU\nIP‐MS Precivity\nLilly assay, MSD\nS‐PLEX, MSD\nSimoa, Quanterix Janssen\nSimoa, ALZpath\nElecsys prototype, Roche (N‐terminal)\nElecsys prototype, Roche (mid‐domain)\nLumipulse\nWashU\nPrecivity\nDiscontinued.

The mean sample size across studies was 560 participants (range: 70 to 2244). Mean age across studies ranged from 62.6 to 85.9 years, and the percentage of males ranged from 33.8% to 60%. Across the 32 studies that evaluated and reported apolipoprotein E (\nThe panel used the GRADE EtD framework for diagnostic test accuracy studies to systematically assess and transparently document the factors influencing the recommendation, including the diagnostic test accuracy, certainty of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, values and preferences, resources required, cost‐effectiveness, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. The completed EtD form (Table\nThe panel decided to use a brand‐agnostic approach to formulating recommendations due to the evolving nature of the field, but did synthesize evidence on the diagnostic test accuracy of the selected tests versus selected reference standards in an associated systematic review.\nDiagnostic test accuracy estimates across tests showed a high degree of variability. Notably, some tests did meet or exceed the panel's established thresholds, meaning a single cut‐point achieved the thresholds of 90% Sn and 75% Sp for triaging or 90% Sn and Sp for confirmatory testing. Across all 31 tests, pooled Sn ranged from 49.31% to 91.41%, and Sp ranged from 61.54% to 96.72%.\nIt is important to note that the panel evaluated only single cut‐point performance. Tests offering two‐cutoff approaches were not assessed due to limited peer‐reviewed evidence available. Summary of findings for all evaluated tests are reported in Table\nThe certainty of the evidence for test accuracy across all tests ranged from moderate to very low, and for tests meeting the panel's predetermined thresholds for accuracy, certainty ranged from low to very low. Most tests were rated down due to serious issues of risk of bias, largely due to not using prespecified thresholds and/or not reporting whether index test results were interpreted without knowledge of reference test results and vice versa. Inconsistency and imprecision varied across tests for both Sn and Sp. Publication bias was not detected for any of the tests.\nThe panel judged the desirable effects of using a BBM test to be large. Compared to current reference standards such as PET or CSF, BBM tests are minimally invasive and can significantly reduce the physical discomfort and anxiety often associated with lumbar puncture or PET imaging procedures. Additionally, blood testing may help streamline the diagnostic process, allowing for more timely identification of underlying AD pathology. This can lead to earlier clinical diagnosis, reduce delays between symptom onset and treatment initiation, and minimize the need for repeated consultations and referrals, thereby decreasing the burden on patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system.\nWhen used appropriately, the panel judged the undesirable effects of BBM tests to be small; however, undesirable effects could be more significant if not used by trained personnel. A key concern is the potential for over testing and increased system burden. The relatively low cost and high accessibility of blood tests may encourage widespread use in settings that are not adequately prepared to implement and interpret the BBM result or provide appropriate follow‐up care and access or referral to specialty services. A poorly structured diagnostic infrastructure could lead to inappropriate testing where a person with a low pretest probability of having AD pathology receives a positive result after a blood test which could almost equally be a FP case as opposed to a true case. FP could cause significant harm if a patient is then started on therapy based on erroneous test results. Similarly, FNs could cause delays in confirmatory testing and treatment.\nVariability in test performance across platforms and manufacturers is another major concern. Not all BBM tests have been validated to the same standard, yet patients and clinicians may assume these tests are interchangeable. This may be especially problematic with direct‐to‐consumer (DTC) tests, which can lead to confusion, misinterpretation, or unwarranted anxiety among patients. Moreover, there is a risk that clinicians may begin to over‐rely on BBM results, using them as a diagnostic shortcut in place of comprehensive clinical and cognitive evaluations. This may contribute to underdiagnosis of treatable, co‐occurring, or non‐AD conditions, particularly in patients with complex or atypical presentations. Inappropriate interpretation of BBM results can also lead to premature or inaccurate diagnostic labeling, potentially harming patient trust and clinical decision‐making.\nWhen a BBM test with acceptable accuracy is used by a trained specialist, the panel judged the desirable effects to be large and undesirable effects to be small to moderate; hence, the balance of effects probably favors the use of BBM tests over CSF, PET scan, or no testing. Overall, BBMs represent a scalable, patient‐friendly option that can enhance diagnostic pathways and expand access to timely care when implemented thoughtfully.\nThe panel agreed that there is possibly important uncertainty or variability in how much people value BBM testing for AD diagnosis due to the highly personal and emotional nature of the decision. While many appreciate the appeal of a minimally invasive test and the opportunity for early diagnosis, others may experience psychological distress, financial burden, or ethical concerns, especially if results are inconclusive or misinterpreted. Preferences also vary based on whether individuals want to know if they have AD, highlighting the need for shared decision‐making and compassionate, transparent communication. This variability in values underscores the importance of individualized approaches to BBM testing.\nThe panel judged savings to be moderate for BBMs compared to PET scans or CSF analysis, primarily due to their lower direct costs and simpler administration. BBMs generally cost significantly less, often 70% to 90% lower than PET imaging, though their exact price varies by country and healthcare setting. In places like the United States, savings are offset by inconsistent reimbursement and potential out‐of‐pocket expenses. When used as a triaging tool followed by confirmatory testing, overall costs may rise, but if BBM tests are able to replace more expensive confirmatory tests, it may yield moderate savings.\nThe panel could not make a judgment about the cost‐effectiveness of BBMs due to a lack of sufficient data on this topic, significant variability by region and payer system.\nThe panel agreed that equity is probably increased with the use of BBMs because they are more affordable, less invasive, and easier to implement than reference tests like PET scans or lumbar punctures. In low‐ and middle‐income countries, where access to specialized equipment and trained personnel is limited, BBMs offer a more feasible diagnostic option, expanding access to early detection and care. Even in high‐income countries, BBMs may increase diagnostic reach among older adults and underserved populations who face barriers to traditional testing. While resource strain and pricing could pose challenges, the overall potential for broader, more equitable access supports a likely improvement in health equity.\nThe panel judged BBMs to be probably acceptable to key collaborative parties because commercially available tests that meet accuracy standards are generally well‐received by patients, clinicians, and health systems. Clinicians may have lower confidence in negative BBM results in patients with a typical clinical presentation of AD syndrome and consider further assessment. However, viewing BBMs as part of a comprehensive diagnostic approach rather than a standalone test helps maintain trust and appropriate use. This balanced perspective supports broad acceptance across collaborative parties.\nThe feasibility of implementing BBMs was judged to vary depending on several factors. While blood collection and storage may be more practical than other modalities, implementation still requires adherence to proper sample handling and storage protocols.\nGuidelines provide a framework for clinicians to make decisions based on evidence, which reduces variability and promotes standardization of care. Laboratory directors can take advantage of this guideline when selecting tests based on standard validation results that align with the needs of the clinicians. Additionally, guidelines can help payers with evaluation of medical necessity to establish reimbursement policies. Our recommendations do not account for proprietary business decisions, such as a company's intent to pursue regulatory approval for a research‐use‐only (RUO) assay.\nThe medical literature regarding BBMs is rapidly evolving, and many different biomarkers and assays are in different stages of development. Assays for the same biomarker frequently use different methods, resulting in varying performance characteristics, and therefore must be evaluated as separate tests. Even for tests that are already clinically available, only a handful of peer‐reviewed published studies met our inclusion criteria. As a result, the existing evidence base is early and somewhat fragile, with the evidence for all tests rated as either “low” or “very low” certainty. When certainty is poor, it is possible that a future study could sway the pooled point estimates to a degree that would impact whether it meets the panel's recommended thresholds for acceptable diagnostic test accuracy. The panel considered the implications of declining to issue a recommendation for any test at this time, deferring until such time that more data emerge and confidence improves. Ultimately, we decided that patients would benefit from a set of “conditional recommendations with low certainty” with an accompanying systematic review of the most accurate and promising tests in the current field. Without this resource, providers may either select BBMs that are less promising than other available BBM options or refer patients for more invasive and expensive testing, when our expert opinion, based on the evidence reviewed here, is that harm could be reduced by the thoughtful use of BBMs in many instances.\nMost studies informing the associated systematic review used single‐batch plasma analyses, which do not reflect real‐world clinical settings where samples are processed on a rolling basis, for example, daily or weekly. In clinical practice, even small assay imprecision and bias can affect interpretation, particularly when applying fixed diagnostic cutoffs. Therefore, clinical laboratories need to evaluate and monitor the coefficient of variation (CV) of biomarker assays to ensure consistent performance and help minimize the risk of misclassification due to analytical variability. This is especially important for biomarkers with small fold changes between AD pathology‐positive and ‐negative individuals, such as Aβ42/40, which are more susceptible to assay imprecision in routine use. Recommendations for such biomarkers should therefore be interpreted with extra caution, since the systematic review did not account for such aspects.\nAt the time of our analysis, the vast majority of peer‐reviewed evidence for individual BBMs presented Sn and Sp based on a single cut‐point. However, because many plasma tests fall short of the accuracy required to confidently rule in or rule out the presence of brain amyloid with a single cut‐point, the field is rapidly moving toward alternate testing paradigms. One promising paradigm is the two‐cutoff approach, where values below a certain cut‐point rule out brain amyloid and values above a certain cut‐point rule in brain amyloid, while values in the middle require further testing with PET imaging or CSF AD biomarkers. The panel will consider this approach in future guideline updates as additional evidence emerges, with careful consideration of the evidence regarding the size of the indeterminate zone. As other groups have noted, a poorly performing assay could create a very large indeterminate zone using two cutoffs that achieve prespecified Sn or Sp targets.\nTo meet the practical needs of clinical users implementing the recommendations found in this guideline, the Alzheimer's Association is also co‐creating distilled and easy‐to‐use clinical tools. These tools will be made available on a dedicated webpage in the future, as they are currently under development.\nIt is important to note that currently, there is a lack of widespread accessibility and reimbursement for many BBM tests, underscoring the need for the development of reimbursement frameworks that enable patients to benefit from emerging diagnostic technologies. The panel urges all collaborative parties to work actively toward ensuring equitable access to BBMs globally, as without deliberate efforts, this promising advancement could paradoxically widen existing disparities among countries, socioeconomic groups, and other vulnerable populations.\nEighty‐four studies were excluded from the evidence base as they combined cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, limiting interpretation for the target population. Additionally, some studies did not provide sufficient diagnostic accuracy data (e.g., TP, TN, FP, and FN) to be included in quantitative analyses. These limitations highlight gaps in the current literature and underscore the need for standardized reporting and stratified analyses in future research.\nIn addition to providing data on populations separated by cognitive status (cognitively impaired vs. unimpaired), we encourage researchers and industry partners to publish detailed and comprehensive data from their studies, including number of TP, TN, FP, FN, cutoff values used and method for determining cutoff (e.g., Youden's index or fixed Sn or Sp), data for multiple cutoffs (if applicable), detailed ROC curves, and methodological details about the conduct of the studies that inform their quality and risk of bias (e.g., random or consecutive sampling; BBM test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard).\nWhile prices for some commercially available BBM tests have been reported, further research is needed to evaluate their relative cost and cost‐effectiveness in various settings. The cost burden of BBM testing can vary by perspective, that is, healthcare systems or payers may face different relative costs than patients, depending on insurance coverage policies. Additionally, indirect costs, such as those related to diagnostic delays or additional testing triggered by BBM results, remain poorly understood. Evidence comparing the cost‐effectiveness across BBM tests is severely limited. To address these gaps and inform healthcare policy and clinical implementation decisions, formal modeling analyses are needed to project the long‐term economic and clinical consequences of BBM testing strategies, including potential downstream costs and savings.\nThis CPG is grounded in a systematic review of the peer‐reviewed literature and developed using the GRADE approach. The use of GRADE ensures a transparent, structured, and evidence‐based process for evaluating the certainty of evidence and formulating recommendations. This methodology strengthens the credibility and reproducibility of the guideline and allows for explicit linkage between evidence and recommendations. The panel acknowledges the inherent limitations in the published literature available to inform these recommendations and has made efforts to transparently describe where data gaps or uncertainties remain.\nIn contrast, regulatory submissions are typically informed by data provided by industry sponsors and submitted to regulatory agencies in the context of product approval or licensure. These data, while often robust, are generally not peer‐reviewed or publicly available at the time of regulatory decision‐making. As a result, some tests that may have received regulatory approval or clearance at the time of this publication may not have been included in the systematic review or the panel's EtD process required for this guideline if peer‐reviewed data were not available or accessible.\nTo enhance the clinical relevance and applicability of the guideline, the panel was intentionally multidisciplinary and diverse in composition. It included experts from a broad range of specialties (e.g., neurology, geriatrics, nursing), as well as methodologists with expertise in guideline development and evidence synthesis. Panelists represented a variety of geographic regions, countries, gender, and years of clinical experience to promote inclusive perspectives and reduce potential biases. This diversity enriched the deliberative process and ensured that the recommendations are applicable across a wide range of clinical contexts and patient populations.\nThe panel acknowledged that the prevalence of brain amyloid in people with cognitive impairment has varied across populations where it has been studied, and there are many other clinical populations where amyloid testing with gold standard tests (PET or lumbar puncture or\nAt this stage, the panel has only considered individual biomarkers (including ratios that use a reference peptide as the denominator) rather than combinations of multiple biomarkers. The panel deliberately chose to focus on individual biomarkers initially to evaluate combinations in subsequent phases. The panel is aware that combinations of biomarkers, such as the p‐tau217/Aβ42 ratio or a fixed combination of Aβ42/Aβ40 and a p‐tau217 ratio, are being commercialized and provided to clinicians.\nBecause new BBM tests are continually becoming available to clinicians, the panel decided not to limit eligibility criteria to tests that were commercially available at the time of this review. As a result, the evidence base includes tests that may currently be commercially and not commercially available, including those that are clinically available, or for research use only.\nLastly, several studies have been published since our latest literature search update in November 2024. These newer studies were not included in the current analysis but will be considered for inclusion in future iterations of this guideline as part of ongoing efforts to ensure recommendations reflect the most up‐to‐date evidence.\nThe key recommendations in this CPG are that for the detection of amyloid pathology in patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting to specialized care settings: (1) BBM tests with ≥90% sensitivity and ≥ 75% specificity can be used as a triaging test and (2) BBM tests with ≥90% sensitivity and specificity can serve as a substitute for amyloid PET imaging or CSF AD biomarker testing.\nThe panel cautions users of this guideline that there is significant variability in diagnostic test accuracy, and many commercially available BBM tests do not meet these thresholds, especially using a single cutoff. Additionally, these tests do not serve as a substitute for comprehensive clinical evaluation by a healthcare professional and should be used only as part of a full diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment presenting to specialized care settings, and with careful consideration of pretest probability of AD pathology.\nDr. Palmqvist receives grant funding for research related to AD from Avid and ki elements through the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (paid to his institution) and in the past 36 months he has received consultancy/speaker fees from BioArtic, Biogen, Eisai, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Roche.

This collaborative effort has resulted in two complementary manuscripts: the present CPG, which provides formal recommendations, and a separate systematic review that presents the underlying evidence base.\nThe guideline was developed in accordance with the AGREE II Reporting Checklist\nThe chairs of the guideline panel were selected by the leadership of the Alzheimer's Association. The panel was composed of 11 members: clinical neurologists (S.Pal., M.S.‐C., S.S., D.G.), geriatricians (H.W., H.O.), nurse practitioner (L.A.), physician assistant (M.P.), and subject‐matter experts, some with clinical expertise (C.T., H.Z., T.K.). Panelists were of diverse geographic distribution and years of clinical experience; six were based in North America, four in Europe, and two held dual affiliations in both regions. To ensure the integrity of the guideline development process, the panel elected to replace one of the co‐chairs when a change in their employment status introduced a potential conflict of interest that would have been challenging to mitigate (see the Acknowledgments section).\nThree guideline methodologists (L.A.K., S.Pah., M.P.T.) oversaw all methodological aspects of the guideline development, including collaboration on the development and execution of a search strategy with a medical librarian (M.B.M.), and two (S.Pah., L.A.K.) oversaw the identification and synthesis of scientific evidence and the evidence‐to‐decision (EtD) process for the clinical question. The Alzheimer's Association's staff, who also served as subject‐matter experts (R.M.E., S.M., S.Pah., M.P.T.), oversaw all administrative and logistical aspects related to the guideline panel, including the managment of conflicts of interest.\nThis guideline's primary target audience includes specialists involved in the diagnostic evaluation of cognitive impairment in specialized care settings. A specialist in this context is defined as a healthcare provider, typically, but not exclusively, in neurology, psychiatry, or geriatrics, who spends at least 25% of their clinical practice time caring for adults with cognitive impairment or dementia. Not all clinicians in these fields are dementia specialists, and providers in other areas of practice may identify as a specialist based on their specific knowledge and training. Specialists are proficient in assessing, diagnosing and treating cognitive disorders, understanding and interpreting the results of brain imaging, CSF, and BBM tests, and clearly communicating the results of the aforementioned tests and their implications to patients and families.\nThis guideline is intended to inform clinical decision‐making, support the development of standards of care, guide laboratory practices, and assist clinicians in selecting appropriate BBM tests for individual patients. In addition, it may help inform the use of BBMs and their incorporation in clinical trial outcomes or decisions in clinical trials with adaptive design.\nThe secondary target audience includes individuals affected by MCI or dementia, their caregivers, policy‐makers involved in dementia care and healthcare decision‐making, and laboratory medicine specialists involved in using BBMs.\nThe panel identified two key clinical questions that warrant recommendation in this first iteration of the guideline:\nShould a BBM test be incorporated as a triaging test to determine the presence or absence of AD pathology in the diagnostic workup of individuals with cognitive impairment (including those with MCI or dementia) presenting for specialized care for memory disorders?\nShould a BBM test serve as a substitute for CSF analysis or amyloid PET as a confirmatory test to determine the presence or absence of AD pathology in the diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia) presenting for specialized care for memory disorders?\nA triaging test refers to a test in which a negative result rules out AD pathology with high probability, whereas a positive result should be confirmed using another method, such as CSF AD biomarkers or amyloid PET.\nA confirmatory test refers to a test for which a negative result rules out AD pathology, and a positive test confirms AD pathology with a high probability.\nInput on these questions was gathered during the 2024 Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), where experts in the field provided insights to inform the development of this guideline.\nThis guideline is not intended to serve as a comprehensive clinical pathway or appropriate use recommendations for the broader diagnostic workup or treatment decision‐making in individuals with MCI or dementia. It does not address the use of BBMs for screening purposes, use in non‐specialty settings, or use in people with no cognitive concerns or only subjective memory impairment.\nThe population and setting for this guideline include individuals with objective cognitive impairment (i.e., MCI or dementia) presenting to specialized care settings due to cognitive complaints. Objective cognitive impairment requires objective evidence of cognitive deficits detected by cognitive assessment tools and/or medical examination and provider assessment. It does not include subjective cognitive decline, in which the patient perceives changes in memory or other cognitive domains but performs as expected on cognitive testing, and a trained provider does not detect notable deficits (e.g., aphasia, disinhibition, executive dysfunction) in assessment.\nThe panel developed recommendations for BBM testing only in individuals with objective cognitive impairment who have already completed a comprehensive clinical workup. This guideline does not extend to cognitively unimpaired individuals, given the current lack of clinical relevance for BBM use in this population. The panel made the a priori decision not to use data for cognitively impaired and unimpaired populations combined to inform recommendations to minimize indirectness and because test performance could appear more favorable in populations with a bimodal distribution of brain amyloid (i.e., individuals with very low [cognitively unimpaired] or very high [AD‐like dementia] brain amyloid levels).\nThis work focuses on specialized care settings, which include practices where a memory disorder specialist (defined in Section\nThe panel determined that primary care and specialized care settings merit separate CPG processes for four main reasons. First, among patients presenting with cognitive impairment, we expect a different prevalence of AD pathology in primary care versus specialized care settings. Different population prevalence means that the same test will have different negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV), which could alter panel recommendations. Second, pretest probability must be considered in setting acceptable thresholds for sensitivity and specificity, and evidence suggests that pretest probability for AD pathology is more accurate when determined in specialist than in non‐specialist settings.\nThe panel was mindful that many BBM tests measuring the same analyte (e.g., p‐tau217) utilize different technology or utilize different antibodies and can achieve different performance characteristics. Therefore, for this guideline, a BBM test is defined as the combination of a BBM (analyte) and the technology used to measure it (e.g., specific immunoassay or mass spectrometry method). For this initial iteration of the guideline, the panel identified plasma assays for phosphorylated‐tau (p‐tau) and Aβ, measuring the following analytes: p‐tau217, the ratio of p‐tau217 to non‐p‐tau217 ×100 (expressed as a percentage of p‐tau217 [%p‐tau217]), p‐tau181, p‐tau231, and Aβ42/Aβ40. To ensure the systematic review was both feasible and clinically relevant, we focused on a limited number of BBMs rather than attempting a broad meta‐analysis across all possible available BBM tests. The panel thus prioritized BBMs most commonly used as indicators of brain amyloid, excluding markers like glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL). We also chose to analyze tests that measure single analytes rather than ratios, unless the ratio included a reference value of the same protein type (i.e., Aβ42/Aβ40). Based on available evidence and head‐to‐head comparison data, including Round Robin results,\nDespite analyzing the specific assays/analytes in the systematic review, the panel opted for a brand‐agnostic, blinded, performance‐based approach for the guideline's recommendations. This approach ensures the guideline's credibility, durability, and actionability. It protects the guideline from perceived bias, reduces misalignment with recent advances, and provides clinicians with meaningful direction. By linking the CPG to our systematic review, we will be able to ensure ongoing relevance without requiring frequent changes to the recommendations themselves.\nThe authors acknowledge that several BBM tests on the market have no published data meeting the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the systematic review; we encourage the manufacturers of these tests to publish evidence on the diagnostic test accuracy of their tests in peer‐reviewed journals.\nThis guideline has been informed by a corresponding systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy, published separately; please refer to that publication for a more detailed description of the systematic review methodology.\nBriefly, the following databases were searched from 2019 through November 3, 2024: PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Methodologists conducted study selection, data extraction, risk of bias, and certainty assessments, and statisticians performed data analysis. Details regarding the literature search strategy can be found in the\nRaw data were sought, including the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), sensitivity (Sn), and specificity (Sp), at the Youden index cutoff. Data were sourced from (1) published studies, (2) author‐provided information when missing from studies, and (3) Sn and Sp associated with the Youden index derived from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using WebPlotDigitizer\nMeta‐analyses of diagnostic test accuracy were conducted for each BBM test to calculate pooled Sn and Sp. The main meta‐analysis examined single cutoffs based on Youden's index. Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the data based on reported versus missing data: (1) reported data only using any cutoff for the index test, (2) reported data using any cutoff for the index test plus data derived from curves at Youden's index when data was missing, (3) fixing Sp cutoff at 75% for triaging, and (4) fixing Sn cutoff at 90% for confirmatory testing.\nThe guideline panel assessed the certainty of the supporting evidence and formulated the recommendations according to the GRADE approach.\nThe panel decided not to make recommendations for or against specific tests; this decision reflects several considerations, including variability in how tests are developed, validated, and implemented across laboratories. Furthermore, manufacturers and laboratories do not typically rely on meta‐analyses to determine test cutoffs for abnormality, and some are even recommending two cutoff approaches. These inconsistencies further support the panel's position that ranking or endorsing specific tests is premature at this time. Instead, test accuracy data and accuracy judgments reported in this guideline are meant to serve as a resource for clinicians implementing the recommendations to aid them in choosing which test(s) to order.\nThe panel aligned clinical thresholds for acceptable accuracy of BBM tests based on what clinicians in real‐world settings would find acceptable and used recent expert opinion as a starting point for that discussion.\nA given patient's pretest probability for AD pathology will vary according to clinical presentation, age, and known risk factors.\nBecause Youden's index cutoff is not always an optimal combination of Sn and Sp, we supplemented with analyses of fixed sensitivity at 90% and fixed specificity at 75% when data were available.\nThe EtD framework was used to translate evidence summaries into practice recommendations.\nDefinitions for interpreting the certainty of the evidence and implementing strong versus conditional recommendations\nNon‐systematic literature searches, along with panel opinion and experience, were used to inform the research evidence for EtD factors as needed.\nMethodologists worked with health economists to summarize published evidence on the cost and cost‐effectiveness of implementing BBMs in specialized care settings. Publicly available sources were used to compare the prices of commercially available BBM tests. A non‐systematic literature review was conducted to identify peer‐reviewed studies assessing the cost‐effectiveness of BBM tests in the diagnostic workup of suspected AD.\nInput from the Association National Early‐Stage Advisory Group (ESAG) made up of patients with early‐stage AD, internal and external collaborative parties, and feedback from a public comment period also informed the final recommendations.\nA draft version of the recommendations was made publicly available, and all feedback submitted during the public comment period (May 12 to May 23) was reviewed by the methods team and the panel. Comments that fell within the scope of the guideline questions and were supported by the available evidence were considered for incorporation into the final guidance. To promote transparency and acknowledge collaborative party contributions, all de‐identified comments, where possible, will be made publicly accessible on the Alzheimer's Association Website\nThis guideline is intended to serve as a regularly updated document and the associated systematic review will be regularly updated as new evidence emerges through the MAGICapp platform\nThese recommendations are designed to support clinicians, patients, caregivers, policy‐makers, and healthcare decision‐makers in making evidence‐informed decisions, specifically regarding which BBM test(s) to use and whether it/they should be used as a triaging or confirmatory test for AD pathology in specialized care settings. The recommendations are not meant to restrict, limit, delay, or deny clinical use, insurance coverage, or patient access to biomarker testing when deemed appropriate by a qualified healthcare provider. Furthermore, these recommendations do not substitute for clinical judgment nor encompass all possible considerations in the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation of AD. We advise clinicians to exercise discretion and adapt their approach based on individual patient circumstances and emerging evidence.\nThe panel formulated two recommendations and one good practice statement for the use of BBM tests in the diagnostic workup of patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized care. These conditional recommendations favor the use of BBM tests and offer acceptable minimum diagnostic test accuracy for triaging and confirmatory tests (Table\nRecommendations and remarks for the use of BBM tests in patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized care\nShould a BBM test be incorporated as a\n\nIn patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized memory‐care, the panel suggests\n\n\nShould a BBM test serve as a substitute for CSF analysis or amyloid PET as a\n\nIn patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting for specialized memory‐care, the panel suggests using a\n\n\nPlease see the associated systematic review\n\nWhen shared decision‐making discussions with the patient finds that there would be low utility in knowing whether AD pathology is present. The utility of a test depends partly on patient preferences and can be related to diagnostic or prognostic value, or if the test result informs a treatment decision. Some patients may only wish to know whether AD pathology is present if that knowledge informs treatment, but other patients may find utility regardless of treatment options.\nPatients with obvious modifiable or temporary conditions that are likely to account for the patient's cognitive impairment.\nPatients with limited life expectancy, as the clinical significance and prognosis of AD pathology are not well‐defined in these populations.\nPatients with a history of conditions that can affect the brain and that may impact levels of a given BBM in ways that have not been well‐studied (e.g., neurocysticercosis, HIV, history of chemotherapy or radiation, chronic traumatic encephalopathy).\nPatients with medical conditions that may affect the levels of a given BBM (e.g., acute brain injury, severe chronic kidney disease, ALS).\nPatients taking certain medications that may impact levels of a given BBM (e.g., neprilysin inhibitors, drugs that disrupt the blood‐brain barrier).\nAbbreviation: AD, Alzheimer's disease; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; BBM, blood‐based biomarker; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; PET, positron emission tomography.\nForty‐nine\nList of assay/analyte combinations studied in the systematic review.\nWashU\nAmyloid MS\nPrecivity\nUniversity of Gothenburg (UGOT)\nSimoa, Quanterix 4plexE\nSimoa, Quanterix single plexes\nSimoa, Quanterix Neuro 3‐plex A kit\nLumipulse\nElecsys\nHISCL, Sysmex\nLilly assay, Meso Scale Discovery (MSD)\nS‐PLEX, MSD\nSimoa, Quanterix p‐tau‐181 Advantage Kit\nSimoa, Quanterix 4plexE\nSimoa, Quanterix UGOT\nLumipulse\nSimoa, ADx Neurosciences\nElecsys, Roche\nWashU\nIP‐MS Precivity\nLilly assay, MSD\nS‐PLEX, MSD\nSimoa, Quanterix Janssen\nSimoa, ALZpath\nElecsys prototype, Roche (N‐terminal)\nElecsys prototype, Roche (mid‐domain)\nLumipulse\nWashU\nPrecivity\nDiscontinued.

The mean sample size across studies was 560 participants (range: 70 to 2244). Mean age across studies ranged from 62.6 to 85.9 years, and the percentage of males ranged from 33.8% to 60%. Across the 32 studies that evaluated and reported apolipoprotein E (\nThe panel used the GRADE EtD framework for diagnostic test accuracy studies to systematically assess and transparently document the factors influencing the recommendation, including the diagnostic test accuracy, certainty of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, values and preferences, resources required, cost‐effectiveness, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. The completed EtD form (Table\nThe panel decided to use a brand‐agnostic approach to formulating recommendations due to the evolving nature of the field, but did synthesize evidence on the diagnostic test accuracy of the selected tests versus selected reference standards in an associated systematic review.\nDiagnostic test accuracy estimates across tests showed a high degree of variability. Notably, some tests did meet or exceed the panel's established thresholds, meaning a single cut‐point achieved the thresholds of 90% Sn and 75% Sp for triaging or 90% Sn and Sp for confirmatory testing. Across all 31 tests, pooled Sn ranged from 49.31% to 91.41%, and Sp ranged from 61.54% to 96.72%.\nIt is important to note that the panel evaluated only single cut‐point performance. Tests offering two‐cutoff approaches were not assessed due to limited peer‐reviewed evidence available. Summary of findings for all evaluated tests are reported in Table\nThe certainty of the evidence for test accuracy across all tests ranged from moderate to very low, and for tests meeting the panel's predetermined thresholds for accuracy, certainty ranged from low to very low. Most tests were rated down due to serious issues of risk of bias, largely due to not using prespecified thresholds and/or not reporting whether index test results were interpreted without knowledge of reference test results and vice versa. Inconsistency and imprecision varied across tests for both Sn and Sp. Publication bias was not detected for any of the tests.\nThe panel judged the desirable effects of using a BBM test to be large. Compared to current reference standards such as PET or CSF, BBM tests are minimally invasive and can significantly reduce the physical discomfort and anxiety often associated with lumbar puncture or PET imaging procedures. Additionally, blood testing may help streamline the diagnostic process, allowing for more timely identification of underlying AD pathology. This can lead to earlier clinical diagnosis, reduce delays between symptom onset and treatment initiation, and minimize the need for repeated consultations and referrals, thereby decreasing the burden on patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system.\nWhen used appropriately, the panel judged the undesirable effects of BBM tests to be small; however, undesirable effects could be more significant if not used by trained personnel. A key concern is the potential for over testing and increased system burden. The relatively low cost and high accessibility of blood tests may encourage widespread use in settings that are not adequately prepared to implement and interpret the BBM result or provide appropriate follow‐up care and access or referral to specialty services. A poorly structured diagnostic infrastructure could lead to inappropriate testing where a person with a low pretest probability of having AD pathology receives a positive result after a blood test which could almost equally be a FP case as opposed to a true case. FP could cause significant harm if a patient is then started on therapy based on erroneous test results. Similarly, FNs could cause delays in confirmatory testing and treatment.\nVariability in test performance across platforms and manufacturers is another major concern. Not all BBM tests have been validated to the same standard, yet patients and clinicians may assume these tests are interchangeable. This may be especially problematic with direct‐to‐consumer (DTC) tests, which can lead to confusion, misinterpretation, or unwarranted anxiety among patients. Moreover, there is a risk that clinicians may begin to over‐rely on BBM results, using them as a diagnostic shortcut in place of comprehensive clinical and cognitive evaluations. This may contribute to underdiagnosis of treatable, co‐occurring, or non‐AD conditions, particularly in patients with complex or atypical presentations. Inappropriate interpretation of BBM results can also lead to premature or inaccurate diagnostic labeling, potentially harming patient trust and clinical decision‐making.\nWhen a BBM test with acceptable accuracy is used by a trained specialist, the panel judged the desirable effects to be large and undesirable effects to be small to moderate; hence, the balance of effects probably favors the use of BBM tests over CSF, PET scan, or no testing. Overall, BBMs represent a scalable, patient‐friendly option that can enhance diagnostic pathways and expand access to timely care when implemented thoughtfully.\nThe panel agreed that there is possibly important uncertainty or variability in how much people value BBM testing for AD diagnosis due to the highly personal and emotional nature of the decision. While many appreciate the appeal of a minimally invasive test and the opportunity for early diagnosis, others may experience psychological distress, financial burden, or ethical concerns, especially if results are inconclusive or misinterpreted. Preferences also vary based on whether individuals want to know if they have AD, highlighting the need for shared decision‐making and compassionate, transparent communication. This variability in values underscores the importance of individualized approaches to BBM testing.\nThe panel judged savings to be moderate for BBMs compared to PET scans or CSF analysis, primarily due to their lower direct costs and simpler administration. BBMs generally cost significantly less, often 70% to 90% lower than PET imaging, though their exact price varies by country and healthcare setting. In places like the United States, savings are offset by inconsistent reimbursement and potential out‐of‐pocket expenses. When used as a triaging tool followed by confirmatory testing, overall costs may rise, but if BBM tests are able to replace more expensive confirmatory tests, it may yield moderate savings.\nThe panel could not make a judgment about the cost‐effectiveness of BBMs due to a lack of sufficient data on this topic, significant variability by region and payer system.\nThe panel agreed that equity is probably increased with the use of BBMs because they are more affordable, less invasive, and easier to implement than reference tests like PET scans or lumbar punctures. In low‐ and middle‐income countries, where access to specialized equipment and trained personnel is limited, BBMs offer a more feasible diagnostic option, expanding access to early detection and care. Even in high‐income countries, BBMs may increase diagnostic reach among older adults and underserved populations who face barriers to traditional testing. While resource strain and pricing could pose challenges, the overall potential for broader, more equitable access supports a likely improvement in health equity.\nThe panel judged BBMs to be probably acceptable to key collaborative parties because commercially available tests that meet accuracy standards are generally well‐received by patients, clinicians, and health systems. Clinicians may have lower confidence in negative BBM results in patients with a typical clinical presentation of AD syndrome and consider further assessment. However, viewing BBMs as part of a comprehensive diagnostic approach rather than a standalone test helps maintain trust and appropriate use. This balanced perspective supports broad acceptance across collaborative parties.\nThe feasibility of implementing BBMs was judged to vary depending on several factors. While blood collection and storage may be more practical than other modalities, implementation still requires adherence to proper sample handling and storage protocols.\nGuidelines provide a framework for clinicians to make decisions based on evidence, which reduces variability and promotes standardization of care. Laboratory directors can take advantage of this guideline when selecting tests based on standard validation results that align with the needs of the clinicians. Additionally, guidelines can help payers with evaluation of medical necessity to establish reimbursement policies. Our recommendations do not account for proprietary business decisions, such as a company's intent to pursue regulatory approval for a research‐use‐only (RUO) assay.\nThe medical literature regarding BBMs is rapidly evolving, and many different biomarkers and assays are in different stages of development. Assays for the same biomarker frequently use different methods, resulting in varying performance characteristics, and therefore must be evaluated as separate tests. Even for tests that are already clinically available, only a handful of peer‐reviewed published studies met our inclusion criteria. As a result, the existing evidence base is early and somewhat fragile, with the evidence for all tests rated as either “low” or “very low” certainty. When certainty is poor, it is possible that a future study could sway the pooled point estimates to a degree that would impact whether it meets the panel's recommended thresholds for acceptable diagnostic test accuracy. The panel considered the implications of declining to issue a recommendation for any test at this time, deferring until such time that more data emerge and confidence improves. Ultimately, we decided that patients would benefit from a set of “conditional recommendations with low certainty” with an accompanying systematic review of the most accurate and promising tests in the current field. Without this resource, providers may either select BBMs that are less promising than other available BBM options or refer patients for more invasive and expensive testing, when our expert opinion, based on the evidence reviewed here, is that harm could be reduced by the thoughtful use of BBMs in many instances.\nMost studies informing the associated systematic review used single‐batch plasma analyses, which do not reflect real‐world clinical settings where samples are processed on a rolling basis, for example, daily or weekly. In clinical practice, even small assay imprecision and bias can affect interpretation, particularly when applying fixed diagnostic cutoffs. Therefore, clinical laboratories need to evaluate and monitor the coefficient of variation (CV) of biomarker assays to ensure consistent performance and help minimize the risk of misclassification due to analytical variability. This is especially important for biomarkers with small fold changes between AD pathology‐positive and ‐negative individuals, such as Aβ42/40, which are more susceptible to assay imprecision in routine use. Recommendations for such biomarkers should therefore be interpreted with extra caution, since the systematic review did not account for such aspects.\nAt the time of our analysis, the vast majority of peer‐reviewed evidence for individual BBMs presented Sn and Sp based on a single cut‐point. However, because many plasma tests fall short of the accuracy required to confidently rule in or rule out the presence of brain amyloid with a single cut‐point, the field is rapidly moving toward alternate testing paradigms. One promising paradigm is the two‐cutoff approach, where values below a certain cut‐point rule out brain amyloid and values above a certain cut‐point rule in brain amyloid, while values in the middle require further testing with PET imaging or CSF AD biomarkers. The panel will consider this approach in future guideline updates as additional evidence emerges, with careful consideration of the evidence regarding the size of the indeterminate zone. As other groups have noted, a poorly performing assay could create a very large indeterminate zone using two cutoffs that achieve prespecified Sn or Sp targets.\nTo meet the practical needs of clinical users implementing the recommendations found in this guideline, the Alzheimer's Association is also co‐creating distilled and easy‐to‐use clinical tools. These tools will be made available on a dedicated webpage in the future, as they are currently under development.\nIt is important to note that currently, there is a lack of widespread accessibility and reimbursement for many BBM tests, underscoring the need for the development of reimbursement frameworks that enable patients to benefit from emerging diagnostic technologies. The panel urges all collaborative parties to work actively toward ensuring equitable access to BBMs globally, as without deliberate efforts, this promising advancement could paradoxically widen existing disparities among countries, socioeconomic groups, and other vulnerable populations.\nEighty‐four studies were excluded from the evidence base as they combined cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, limiting interpretation for the target population. Additionally, some studies did not provide sufficient diagnostic accuracy data (e.g., TP, TN, FP, and FN) to be included in quantitative analyses. These limitations highlight gaps in the current literature and underscore the need for standardized reporting and stratified analyses in future research.\nIn addition to providing data on populations separated by cognitive status (cognitively impaired vs. unimpaired), we encourage researchers and industry partners to publish detailed and comprehensive data from their studies, including number of TP, TN, FP, FN, cutoff values used and method for determining cutoff (e.g., Youden's index or fixed Sn or Sp), data for multiple cutoffs (if applicable), detailed ROC curves, and methodological details about the conduct of the studies that inform their quality and risk of bias (e.g., random or consecutive sampling; BBM test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard).\nWhile prices for some commercially available BBM tests have been reported, further research is needed to evaluate their relative cost and cost‐effectiveness in various settings. The cost burden of BBM testing can vary by perspective, that is, healthcare systems or payers may face different relative costs than patients, depending on insurance coverage policies. Additionally, indirect costs, such as those related to diagnostic delays or additional testing triggered by BBM results, remain poorly understood. Evidence comparing the cost‐effectiveness across BBM tests is severely limited. To address these gaps and inform healthcare policy and clinical implementation decisions, formal modeling analyses are needed to project the long‐term economic and clinical consequences of BBM testing strategies, including potential downstream costs and savings.\nThis CPG is grounded in a systematic review of the peer‐reviewed literature and developed using the GRADE approach. The use of GRADE ensures a transparent, structured, and evidence‐based process for evaluating the certainty of evidence and formulating recommendations. This methodology strengthens the credibility and reproducibility of the guideline and allows for explicit linkage between evidence and recommendations. The panel acknowledges the inherent limitations in the published literature available to inform these recommendations and has made efforts to transparently describe where data gaps or uncertainties remain.\nIn contrast, regulatory submissions are typically informed by data provided by industry sponsors and submitted to regulatory agencies in the context of product approval or licensure. These data, while often robust, are generally not peer‐reviewed or publicly available at the time of regulatory decision‐making. As a result, some tests that may have received regulatory approval or clearance at the time of this publication may not have been included in the systematic review or the panel's EtD process required for this guideline if peer‐reviewed data were not available or accessible.\nTo enhance the clinical relevance and applicability of the guideline, the panel was intentionally multidisciplinary and diverse in composition. It included experts from a broad range of specialties (e.g., neurology, geriatrics, nursing), as well as methodologists with expertise in guideline development and evidence synthesis. Panelists represented a variety of geographic regions, countries, gender, and years of clinical experience to promote inclusive perspectives and reduce potential biases. This diversity enriched the deliberative process and ensured that the recommendations are applicable across a wide range of clinical contexts and patient populations.\nThe panel acknowledged that the prevalence of brain amyloid in people with cognitive impairment has varied across populations where it has been studied, and there are many other clinical populations where amyloid testing with gold standard tests (PET or lumbar puncture or\nAt this stage, the panel has only considered individual biomarkers (including ratios that use a reference peptide as the denominator) rather than combinations of multiple biomarkers. The panel deliberately chose to focus on individual biomarkers initially to evaluate combinations in subsequent phases. The panel is aware that combinations of biomarkers, such as the p‐tau217/Aβ42 ratio or a fixed combination of Aβ42/Aβ40 and a p‐tau217 ratio, are being commercialized and provided to clinicians.\nBecause new BBM tests are continually becoming available to clinicians, the panel decided not to limit eligibility criteria to tests that were commercially available at the time of this review. As a result, the evidence base includes tests that may currently be commercially and not commercially available, including those that are clinically available, or for research use only.\nLastly, several studies have been published since our latest literature search update in November 2024. These newer studies were not included in the current analysis but will be considered for inclusion in future iterations of this guideline as part of ongoing efforts to ensure recommendations reflect the most up‐to‐date evidence.\nThe key recommendations in this CPG are that for the detection of amyloid pathology in patients with objective cognitive impairment presenting to specialized care settings: (1) BBM tests with ≥90% sensitivity and ≥ 75% specificity can be used as a triaging test and (2) BBM tests with ≥90% sensitivity and specificity can serve as a substitute for amyloid PET imaging or CSF AD biomarker testing.\nThe panel cautions users of this guideline that there is significant variability in diagnostic test accuracy, and many commercially available BBM tests do not meet these thresholds, especially using a single cutoff. Additionally, these tests do not serve as a substitute for comprehensive clinical evaluation by a healthcare professional and should be used only as part of a full diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment presenting to specialized care settings, and with careful consideration of pretest probability of AD pathology.\nDr. Palmqvist receives grant funding for research related to AD from Avid and ki elements through the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (paid to his institution) and in the past 36 months he has received consultancy/speaker fees from BioArtic, Biogen, Eisai, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Roche.

The current review describes that these vulnerable circuits express magnified calcium signaling needed for higher cognition and memory, but that heightened calcium signaling becomes toxic when dysregulated by age and inflammation.

The novelty and contributions of this work are 2‐fold: (1) we found the QTM velocity patterns across the AD continuum; (2) we identified the brain arterial pathways that supplied blood to the earliest altered regions. The results show that reduced perfusion velocity occurs first mainly in the MCAFR and MCATL regions, supplied by the MCA, before spreading to other regions. Group comparisons of QTM velocity and sliding‐window GCA demonstrated that MCATL exhibits reduced QTM velocity in the early stages, and its change drives QTM velocity reductions in several other regions, including ACAL, LLSR, MCAFL, MCATR, MCAOR, MCAIL, MCIIR, PCATL, PCATR, PCAOR, and ACTPR. Additionally, our results reveal that QTM velocity in both the MCAFR and MCATL regions is significantly associated with overall cognition (MMSE), immediate recall score, TMT‐A, TMT‐B, and VFT.\nThe MCATL, supplied by the MCA, includes the superior and middle temporal lobes (MTL), hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala. The MTL is a critical region for early tau pathology in AD,\nGiven that vascular injury is an early precursor to reduced cerebral perfusion in AD, we divided the cerebrum into 26 regions (13 per hemisphere) based on cerebral arterial territories.\nIn this study, we constructed pseudo‐time series of QTM velocity based on cognition scores to explore the relationship between QTM velocity changes in various brain regions during AD progression. Cognition partially reflects AD progression, but there are discrepancies between AD pathology and cognition measures.\nFor sliding‐window analysis, the window length is a critical parameter. A shorter window length provides higher temporal resolution across AD progression, but obtaining accurate GCA coefficients becomes challenging due to limited time points within shorter windows. A previous study demonstrated that sliding window lengths of 30, 50, or 70 yield highly consistent results.\nThere is no association between QTM velocity and the ALPS index in the NC, MCI, or AD groups, but a weak correlation was observed in the whole cohort. This suggests that blood perfusion velocity might be partially driven by ISF diffusivity overall, although there may be a complex interplay between them within each diagnostic group. Glymphatic function has been proposed to explain brain clearance deficits in AD. The DTI‐based ALPS index is an effective marker of ISF dynamics, potentially related to glymphatic function.\nTraditional arterial input function (AIF)‐based CBF quantification assumes a single global AIF for all voxels within the imaging volume, which can introduce errors and violate the principle of local mass conservation.\nBrain perfusion is closely linked to neuronal activity through neurovascular coupling, ensuring the delivery of oxygen and nutrients based on metabolic demands. However, systemic factors, including blood pressure, vascular health, and the autoregulatory capacity of blood vessels, also play significant roles. In the early stages of AD, a mismatch between brain perfusion and blood velocity may indicate compensatory mechanisms within CBF regulation, particularly involving neurovascular coupling.\nSeveral limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, the sample sizes across diagnostic groups are unbalanced, with relatively small sample sizes in the NC and AD groups. A large‐scale prospective study, including participants with subjective cognitive decline, is needed to further explore the Granger causality of blood flow velocity changes. Second, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data were not available, and thus the association between QTM velocity, brain clearance, and Aβ deposition could not be examined. Third, GCA was applied to a cognitive score–ordered cross‐sectional dataset and does not support temporal inference. Moreover, the MMSE and RAVLT were coarse, non‐linear, and potentially noisy and thus could not completely capture AD pathology, which might not fully satisfy the condition of using GCA. Fourth, although we have done the numerical validation in simulated microvasculature of the kidney,\nIn this study, we found that reduced cerebral QTM velocity initially appears in the occipital and temporal regions supplied by the MCA and PCA. By combining QTM and GCA, we showed that the reduced QTM velocity in the MCATL derives regional QTM velocity reductions during the early stage of AD, indicating its potential as an early biomarker for AD diagnosis. There was a weak association between QTM velocity and the ALPS index in the whole cohort, suggesting that blood perfusion velocity may partially drive the ISF dynamics and glymphatic activities.\nY.W. owns equity of Medimagemetric LLC.

The novelty and contributions of this work are 2‐fold: (1) we found the QTM velocity patterns across the AD continuum; (2) we identified the brain arterial pathways that supplied blood to the earliest altered regions. The results show that reduced perfusion velocity occurs first mainly in the MCAFR and MCATL regions, supplied by the MCA, before spreading to other regions. Group comparisons of QTM velocity and sliding‐window GCA demonstrated that MCATL exhibits reduced QTM velocity in the early stages, and its change drives QTM velocity reductions in several other regions, including ACAL, LLSR, MCAFL, MCATR, MCAOR, MCAIL, MCIIR, PCATL, PCATR, PCAOR, and ACTPR. Additionally, our results reveal that QTM velocity in both the MCAFR and MCATL regions is significantly associated with overall cognition (MMSE), immediate recall score, TMT‐A, TMT‐B, and VFT.\nThe MCATL, supplied by the MCA, includes the superior and middle temporal lobes (MTL), hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala. The MTL is a critical region for early tau pathology in AD,\nGiven that vascular injury is an early precursor to reduced cerebral perfusion in AD, we divided the cerebrum into 26 regions (13 per hemisphere) based on cerebral arterial territories.\nIn this study, we constructed pseudo‐time series of QTM velocity based on cognition scores to explore the relationship between QTM velocity changes in various brain regions during AD progression. Cognition partially reflects AD progression, but there are discrepancies between AD pathology and cognition measures.\nFor sliding‐window analysis, the window length is a critical parameter. A shorter window length provides higher temporal resolution across AD progression, but obtaining accurate GCA coefficients becomes challenging due to limited time points within shorter windows. A previous study demonstrated that sliding window lengths of 30, 50, or 70 yield highly consistent results.\nThere is no association between QTM velocity and the ALPS index in the NC, MCI, or AD groups, but a weak correlation was observed in the whole cohort. This suggests that blood perfusion velocity might be partially driven by ISF diffusivity overall, although there may be a complex interplay between them within each diagnostic group. Glymphatic function has been proposed to explain brain clearance deficits in AD. The DTI‐based ALPS index is an effective marker of ISF dynamics, potentially related to glymphatic function.\nTraditional arterial input function (AIF)‐based CBF quantification assumes a single global AIF for all voxels within the imaging volume, which can introduce errors and violate the principle of local mass conservation.\nBrain perfusion is closely linked to neuronal activity through neurovascular coupling, ensuring the delivery of oxygen and nutrients based on metabolic demands. However, systemic factors, including blood pressure, vascular health, and the autoregulatory capacity of blood vessels, also play significant roles. In the early stages of AD, a mismatch between brain perfusion and blood velocity may indicate compensatory mechanisms within CBF regulation, particularly involving neurovascular coupling.\nSeveral limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, the sample sizes across diagnostic groups are unbalanced, with relatively small sample sizes in the NC and AD groups. A large‐scale prospective study, including participants with subjective cognitive decline, is needed to further explore the Granger causality of blood flow velocity changes. Second, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data were not available, and thus the association between QTM velocity, brain clearance, and Aβ deposition could not be examined. Third, GCA was applied to a cognitive score–ordered cross‐sectional dataset and does not support temporal inference. Moreover, the MMSE and RAVLT were coarse, non‐linear, and potentially noisy and thus could not completely capture AD pathology, which might not fully satisfy the condition of using GCA. Fourth, although we have done the numerical validation in simulated microvasculature of the kidney,\nIn this study, we found that reduced cerebral QTM velocity initially appears in the occipital and temporal regions supplied by the MCA and PCA. By combining QTM and GCA, we showed that the reduced QTM velocity in the MCATL derives regional QTM velocity reductions during the early stage of AD, indicating its potential as an early biomarker for AD diagnosis. There was a weak association between QTM velocity and the ALPS index in the whole cohort, suggesting that blood perfusion velocity may partially drive the ISF dynamics and glymphatic activities.\nY.W. owns equity of Medimagemetric LLC.

First, polyimide (poly(pyromellitic dianhydride-co-4,4′-oxydianiline)amic acid solution) was spin coated on copper sheets at 1000 rpm for 120 s (HD MicroSystems). Then, they are baked in a nitrogen oven at 150°C to yield a 2-μm-thick polyimide layer coated on thick copper sheets. Subsequently, PDMS was spin coated on a glass slide at 1000 rpm for 120 s and cured in an oven at 80°C as a temporary substrate. To improve bonding, copper slides coated with polyimide and glass slides coated with PDMS were activated with ultraviolet light for 3 min. The polyimide-coated side of the copper sheet was then attached to the PDMS-coated glass slide. The bilayer copper/polyimide film was laser etched respectively (SAMLight; frequency, 40 kHz; pulse length, 10 ns).\nOn two separate glass slides, polymethylmethacrylate and silica gel were successively spin coated as a sacrificial layer for 60 s and cured at 80°C for 30 min at room temperature. Matrix arrays of piezoelectric ceramics (Del Piezo Specialties) were then bonded to the bond pads by curing the conductive epoxy at room temperature for 30 min at 50°C to avoid high temperature–induced depolarization of the piezoelectric ceramics. The wire on the layer was bonded to a flat flexible cable using solder paste (melting point, 138°C) and spin coated with a 50-μm-thick Ecoflex layer at 1000 rpm for 30 s and cured at room temperature for 3 hours. Laser ablation was used to create vertical interconnect accesses through the Ecoflex layers to expose the bonding pads in the layer stretchable electrode. Subsequently, the aforementioned piece of glass should be bonded to the piezoelectric ceramics on another piece of glass using conductive epoxy resin, after which the bond should be cured. Last, the gaps between the two glass sheets were filled with PDMS, which was cured at room temperature subsequently and removed off the glass to obtain the ultrasound patch.\nWe simulated the diverging and focused ultrasound beams in water using finite element simulation.

The C57BL/6 mice with no genetic modification were selected as WT mice, which were treated with nothing (group 1). As a comparison, the FAD mice were randomly divided into two experimental groups (\nAt the endpoint, the mice were euthanized and transcranial perfused with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Major organs, including the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and brain, were sectioned, and kept in PFA for 24 hours. H&E and Nissl staining were performed on paraffin-embedded sections in accordance with the standard protocols. For immunofluorescence staining, the sections were incubated for 12 hours at 4°C in rabbit anti-Iba-1 (1:500, Abcam), rabbit anti-CD206 (1:200, Hua bio), and mouse anti-CD86 (1:100, Abcam). Then, sections were incubated with the Alexa 555 goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) or Alexa 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG. Subsequently, the nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 15 min. Last, the sections were visualized and analyzed using a digital slide scanner (Pannoramic MIDI, 3DHistech Ltd), and the corresponding positive stained areas were counted and analyzed using the ImageJ software.\nThe pool was divided into four invisible quadrants; a 10-cm platform was fixed to 1 cm beneath the surface of water. During the test, several patterns/signs (a cross, a circle, a triangle, and a square designed using a construction paper) were used as clues for mice. A small amount of titanium dioxide was added to make the water opaque, and the inner wall of the pool was pasted with white paper. The temperature of the pool was maintained at 18.0°C by adding ice cubes. During the first 5 days, the animals were tested four times daily from four different positions around the border of the maze, and they were allowed to swim for 60 s to find the platform, on which they were allowed to stay for 10 s. On the sixth day, the mice were tested for memory retention in a probe trial with the platform removed, and each of the mice was allowed to swim 60 s from two starting points far away from the platform. The automatic video tracking system overhead was used to record the tracks of the mice (from the starting point to the platform), and the differences in latency and swimming speed, among others, were analyzed (\nThe RNA levels of main genes in hippocampal tissue were determined by qRT-PCR. First, the RNA was isolated from wound tissue samples using the extraction solution kit. The RNA quantity and quality were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000/2000c spectrophotometer at 260-nm/280-nm wavelengths. Next, the complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN). Gene expression was performed using a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). TaqMan Array Plates for mouse hippocampus tissue gene expression were used where a library of genes was screened. The cDNAs synthesized in the previous step were then added to each plate and followed by quantitative analysis using a Bio-Rad PCR system (CFX Connect). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was used as the endogenous control.

Laser ablation was used to create vertical interconnect accesses through the Ecoflex layers to expose the bonding pads in the layer stretchable electrode. Subsequently, the aforementioned piece of glass should be bonded to the piezoelectric ceramics on another piece of glass using conductive epoxy resin, after which the bond should be cured. Last, the gaps between the two glass sheets were filled with PDMS, which was cured at room temperature subsequently and removed off the glass to obtain the ultrasound patch.\nWe simulated the diverging and focused ultrasound beams in water using finite element simulation. The medium was set as uniform with a sound speed of 1540 m/s and a density of 1000 kg/m\nThe Aβ\nBecause it emits enhanced fluorescence (λ\nTo assess in vitro biocompatibility, L929 (C3H/An, Fibroblast, rrid: CVCL_0462) and N2a cells were dispensed into 96-well plates at a final concentration of 1 × 10\nAll animal experiments in this study were carried out in accordance with guidelines that are evaluated and approved by the ethics committee of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China (approval numbers: IACUC-202400001 and PN-202500048). The C57BL/6 mice and FAD (APP/PS1, male, 5 months old, RRID: MMRRC_034829-JAX) mice were purchased from the Guangdong Provincial Medical Laboratory Animal Center (Guangzhou, China). The C57BL/6 mice with no genetic modification were selected as WT mice, which were treated with nothing (group 1). As a comparison, the FAD mice were randomly divided into two experimental groups (\nAt the endpoint, the mice were euthanized and transcranial perfused with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Major organs, including the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and brain, were sectioned, and kept in PFA for 24 hours. H&E and Nissl staining were performed on paraffin-embedded sections in accordance with the standard protocols. For immunofluorescence staining, the sections were incubated for 12 hours at 4°C in rabbit anti-Iba-1 (1:500, Abcam), rabbit anti-CD206 (1:200, Hua bio), and mouse anti-CD86 (1:100, Abcam). Then, sections were incubated with the Alexa 555 goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) or Alexa 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG. Subsequently, the nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 15 min. Last, the sections were visualized and analyzed using a digital slide scanner (Pannoramic MIDI, 3DHistech Ltd), and the corresponding positive stained areas were counted and analyzed using the ImageJ software.\nThe pool was divided into four invisible quadrants; a 10-cm platform was fixed to 1 cm beneath the surface of water. During the test, several patterns/signs (a cross, a circle, a triangle, and a square designed using a construction paper) were used as clues for mice. A small amount of titanium dioxide was added to make the water opaque, and the inner wall of the pool was pasted with white paper. The temperature of the pool was maintained at 18.0°C by adding ice cubes. During the first 5 days, the animals were tested four times daily from four different positions around the border of the maze, and they were allowed to swim for 60 s to find the platform, on which they were allowed to stay for 10 s. On the sixth day, the mice were tested for memory retention in a probe trial with the platform removed, and each of the mice was allowed to swim 60 s from two starting points far away from the platform. The automatic video tracking system overhead was used to record the tracks of the mice (from the starting point to the platform), and the differences in latency and swimming speed, among others, were analyzed (\nThe RNA levels of main genes in hippocampal tissue were determined by qRT-PCR. First, the RNA was isolated from wound tissue samples using the extraction solution kit. The RNA quantity and quality were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000/2000c spectrophotometer at 260-nm/280-nm wavelengths. Next, the complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN). Gene expression was performed using a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). TaqMan Array Plates for mouse hippocampus tissue gene expression were used where a library of genes was screened. The cDNAs synthesized in the previous step were then added to each plate and followed by quantitative analysis using a Bio-Rad PCR system (CFX Connect). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was used as the endogenous control. The sequence of primers such as Trem2, Cx3cr1, and GAPDH genes is as follows: Trem2 genes, AAGCGGAATGGGAGCACAG (forward) and CTCGGAGACTCTGACACTGGTAG (reverse); Cx3cr1 genes, CAGTTGTGACATGAAGAGGGACC (forward) and GCAAAGGCGTAGATAAAGGGG (reverse); and GAPDH genes, CCTCGTCCCGTAGACAAAATG (forward) and TGAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTCGT (reverse).\nAll statistical data were expressed as mean ± SD.

Our findings reveal exacerbated synaptic and neuronal loss in low-Aβ or high-glia areas, indicating the diverse roles of glial cell states in shaping the local immune response in AD.\nThe human brain tissues were obtained through the ROSMAP (Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project) cohort studies at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL.

Clinicopathological information of the donor, including postmortem time, age, and sex, is recorded (Supplementary Table 1). Neuropathological diagnosis of the Aβ deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and other pathologies is provided (Supplementary Table 1). We selected 13 individuals clinically diagnosed as AD with high pathology and 8 controls with no cognitive impairment (NCI) and no or very little pathology. All individuals are female and matched for age. We chose all female individuals because there were insufficient males in the ROSMAP cohort matching our selection criteria (e.g. RIN > 5, age-matched, minimal freezing artifacts in frozen DLPFC). Frozen brain blocks of the right-hemisphere DLPFC from 21 individuals were cut (~ 1 cm\nFrozen brain blocks were embedded in OCT and cryosectioned coronally to a thickness of 10 μm using a Leica CM1950 cryostat set at −17C. Sectioning was done in sets of three (middle section for ST and two adjacent sections for IF), with 10–50 μm between each set. Sections were attached to Visium slides and stored at −80C in a slide mailer for up to one week before proceeding with spatial transcriptomics. ST-adjacent sections were attached to pre-labeled Leica superfrost plus slides and stored at −80C in slide mailers for up to two weeks before proceeding with immunohistochemistry.\nSpatial Transcriptomics was performed according to the Visium Spatial Gene Expression User Guide (10X Genomics;\nWe first attempted to perform IHC staining on the ST section, following 10X Genomics recommendations. However, due to the modified protocol required to preserve RNA integrity (i.e., methanol instead of PFA fixation, no antigen retrieval, shorter blocking, and antibody incubations), we were unable to obtain adequate staining quality. We decided instead to perform IHC on two ST-adjacent sections. Cryosectioned tissue on Leica super-frost slides was transferred from −80C to the lab on dry ice and quickly thawed for 1 min on a heat block at 37 C, then immediately transferred to a slide-mailer filled with PFA pre-equilibrated to 4 C and fixed at 4 C for 20 min. Slides were washed twice with DPBS before performing antigen retrieval for 10 min @ 95 C in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Following antigen retrieval, slides were washed three times with DPBS, a hydrophobic barrier was drawn surrounding the tissue (two sections per slide), and then sections were blocked for 1 h at RT in blocking buffer (DPBS containing 5% normal goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, and Human TruStain FcX (Fc blocker)). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies to detect Aβ (4G8), GFAP, and IBA1 (diluted in blocking buffer). The next day, the primary antibody solution was removed, and sections were washed three times with DPBS (5 min per wash). Sections were then incubated for 1.5 h at RT in the dark with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 for Aβ, Alexa Fluor 790 for GFAP, and Alexa Fluor 594 for IBA1) diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer. The secondary antibody solution was removed, and sections were washed four times with DPBS (5 min per wash), then incubated with DAPI to stain nuclei and Trueblack (according to the manufacturer’s instructions) to quench tissue autofluorescence. Slides were coverslipped and imaged on the ThermoFisher CellInsight CX7 LZR High Content Analysis Platform (HCA; 100 16-bit images per section).\nH&E images were acquired from ST sections with an Eclipse Ti2-E microscope (Nikon) at 20 × magnification in 9 × 9 tile tiff files with 10% overlap and were stitched into a single image per section with Adobe Photoshop (23.4.2 release). We note that some patches not covered by tissue could not be stitched, but tissue-covered areas were unaffected. To verify this, we confirmed alignment of spot coordinates to the H&E image. Fluorescent Aβ, GFAP, IBA1, and DAPI images were acquired from the two adjacent sections with the ThermoFisher HCA at 20 × magnification in 10 × 10 tile 16-bit tiff files. Background and shading correction were performed with the ImageJ plugin BaSiC [\nDue to the non-uniform intensity background across tiles and bright areas arising from artifacts such as tissue wrinkles and tears, we applied standard image processing techniques for further background correction and artifact removal. Using a structural element with a size well above that of amyloid plaques, microglia, and astrocytes, for each IF image, we performed grayscale opening and closing to extract large bright artifacts and local background inhomogeneity, which we regressed out from the image. With the artifact-corrected IHC images, we quantified the amount of amyloid, microglia, and astrocytes by averaging the intensity of pixels within each spot of the ST sections. We excluded spots near tissue borders overlapping with bright artifacts from our analysis.\nFFPE cortical sections were pre-heated for 60 min at 60 C in a dry oven and then rehydrated using a series of xylene and ethanol dilutions before rehydrating in DI water. Sections were then used for performing antigen retrieval for 20 min in boiling 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Following antigen retrieval, sections were washed with DPBS, incubated in 0.02N HCl for 20 min for peroxide blocking, washed with DPBS, and blocked for 1 h at RT in TNB blocking buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.5% Akoya blocking reagent; prepared as per manufacturer's instructions). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies diluted in the TNB blocking buffer to detect combinations of Aβ (4G8; 1:1000), GFAP (1:1500), IBA1 (1:200), cleaved Caspase-3 (1:250), NeuN (1:100), SYP (1:500) and/or CD68 (1:100). The following day, primary antibody solution was removed from sections, washed three times with TNT wash buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) (5 min per wash) and incubated for 1 h at RT in the dark with species-appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 568, Alexa Fluor 647, Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 790) diluted 1:1000 in DPBS. For cleaved Caspase-3 staining, the antibody was detected with a Mouse IgM-HRP secondary, incubated for 1 h at RT, followed by a 5 min incubation with tyramide Cy5. After secondary antibody incubation, sections were washed three times with TNT wash buffer (5 min per wash), then incubated with Trueblack for 1 min to quench tissue autofluorescence. Slides were washed two times with DPBS (5 min per wash), incubated with Hoechst 34580 (1:2000 in DPBS) for staining nuclei, mounted using Prolong antifade mountant and coverslipped. Slides were dried overnight at RT and imaged on the ThermoFisher HCA (200–300 16-bit images per section).\nIHC stained slides were imaged on the ThermoFisher HCA at 20x. 24 fields per section were selected to profile the thickness of the cortex from the meninges to the white matter for each subject. Images were processed using the compartmental analysis module in the HCA software. After background correction, 4G8 staining was used to identify plaque-like objects with the following parameters: objectarea > 20 μm, smoothing = 2. The 4G8-based objects were used as a mask to generate a region of interest (ROI) for the GFAP and IBA1 channels that encompassed both the object area and an extension from the edge of each object up to 25 μm without overlap. Calculated metrics, including the average ROI intensity for each channel, object size, and object shape, and counts were exported from the software. The data was filtered for an average 4G8 intensity > 2000. To adjust for technical differences in staining intensities between slides, the intensity data was scaled and centered for each case, and these resulting z-scores were used for subsequent plots. To classify plaques, an investigator blinded to the HCA measurements manually scored all 4G8-based objects as diffuse, compact, or dense core plaques (or as a staining artifact or vessel Aβ, both of which were excluded) yielding a final sample size of n = 722 plaques from n = 9 cases. For target intensity measurements, either the compartmental or colocalization analysis modules of the CellInsight system were used to define secondary objects and extract the average intensity and counts within each ROI. The top 25% of 4G8-based objects based on the scaled average 4G8 intensity was defined as high Aβ and the lower 75% as low Aβ. Objects with an ROI scoring in the top 25% for either scaled GFAP or scaled IBA1 average intensities were defined as glia-high and the remaining objects as glia-low. For NeuN (n = 10)/SYP(n = 9) (Fig.\nSequencing data were pre-processed with Space Ranger pipeline (10 × Genomics), which mapped the barcodes against the human genome (Gencode 27), generated FASTQ files, and generated a count matrix for each section. The individual files were then merged in a Seurat object (Seurat v4.2.0) and were processed in R. We calculated per-spot quality metrics and spots with low-measured genes (< 500) were removed. The Seurat::SCTransform function was used to normalize and scale the UMI counts based on regularized negative binomial regression. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the top 3000 variable genes.

Upon inspection of the qPlot (Supplementary Fig.\nWe performed co-expression network analysis using all spots and sections of the ST data.

Cells were co-cultured for 72 h prior to treatment with 50ug/ml oligomeric-Aβ or vehicle. After 24 h, both adherent and suspension cell fractions were collected, washed with PBS, and dissociated with accutase. Cells were washed in wash buffer [PBS, 2% BSA, 0.2U/μl RNAse inhibitor] and centrifuged at 300xg for 5 min at 4 °C, then filtered through 70 Flowmi strainers. Cells were counted using trypan blue on a Countess II (Invitrogen).\nWe prepared separate libraries from both the adherent and suspension cell fractions using 10X Genomics 3’ single-cell gene expression assays v3 and sequenced them on a NovaSeq 6000 to a depth of 50 k reads/cell.

We used GFAP and IBA1 because studies show that increased expression of GFAP [\nTo investigate the effects of Aβ plaques, we first stratified the 258,986 ST spots into three groups: no, low, and high Aβ, based on the average fluorescence intensity of Aβ in the corresponding 55-μm-diameter area from the two adjacent IHC stained sections (Fig.\nStratification of tissue microdomains by adjacent-section IHC intensities.\nTo examine the transcriptomic effects of Aβ, we first summed the expression values of all gray matter spots within a brain section for each stratified spot group (Fig.\nDifferential effects of low vs. high Aβ on the local transcriptome.\nGSEA on the low versus high Aβ contrasts shows reduced synaptic functions (Fig.\nFurthermore, we performed GSEA with specific genesets relevant to plaque-glia niches (Fig.\nAt the gene level, we detected lower expression of neuronal (\nTo examine differential Aβ effects on intercellular communications, we used NICHES [\nAβ plaques influence intercellular communication.\nTo test whether plaque-surrounding glia influences the local transcriptome within plaque-glia niches, we contrasted the glia-high versus glia-low gray matter spots with and without stratification by Aβ intensity (Fig.\nDifferential effects of glia abundance on the local transcriptome.\nTo assess the independent effects of astrocytes or microglia, we stratified and labeled spots based on the intensities of A-beta, GFAP and IBA1. For example, HHL denotes high A-beta, high GFAP, and low IBA1, respectively. We examined four contrasts: HHL vs. HLL, HLH vs. HLL, LHL vs. LLL, and LLH vs. LLL. After retaining brain sections with at least 50 spots for pseudobulk analysis, the number of available individuals per group was limited: 1 (HHL), 6 (HLH), 5 (HLL), 5 (LHL), 11 (LLH), and 15 (LLL). Due to these limited sample sizes, we detected minimal DEGs, except for LHL vs. LLL contrast, which revealed 133 DEGs. (Supplementary Table 9).\nDepending on the Aβ conditions, we detected different gene expression changes and geneset enrichment. Under the low Aβ condition, expression of genes related to lysosome/autophagy (\nIn addition to gene ontology (GO), we further applied GSEA with gene signatures of PIG [\nWe then set out to validate the synaptic and neuronal loss in the high-glia spots. To this end, we stained FFPE sections from 10 AD individuals with Aβ, GFAP, and IBA1 and synaptophysin (SYP) to label synapses or NeuN to label neuronal nuclei (Fig.\nWe again applied NICHES to estimate differences in microenvironments centering around each ST spot. We first contrasted glia-high versus glia-low to identify differentially expressed LRs under low Aβ, high Aβ, and combined conditions (Supplementary Table 8). We observed a positive correlation (R = 0.41) between the low Aβ and high Aβ conditions. The expression of LRs related to synaptic pathways (\nPlaque-surrounding reactive glia modifies intercellular communication.\nStudies have shown that Aβ plaques are potential reservoirs of oligomeric Aβ, often forming a\"halo\"around Aβ plaques [\nAβ oligomer treatment of co-cultured iMGL partially recapitulates ST glia response to Aβ plaques.\nWe acquired scRNA-seq data from 13,740 cells under the Aβ untreated and treated conditions. After standard data processing and filtering, we applied unsupervised clustering on the first 15 principal components to group the cells (Supplementary Fig. 10 C). We identified 5 major cell clusters that we annotated based on classical markers as iMGLs, astrocytes, neurons, cycling neuroglial progenitors, and other progenitors (Fig.\nWe then further divided the Aβ-treated iMGLs into 4 subclusters (iMGL1-4; Fig.\nWhile Aβ plaques and reactive glia have long been known to be associated with neurodegeneration, their interaction effects on local transcriptomes have not been extensively studied using ST. Here, we report paired ST-IHC measurements across 78 samples from 21 ROSMAP individuals. This large sample size enables statistical inference of Aβ and glial effects that are not merely observed in a limited sample size. By coupling ST readouts with IHC features of Aβ plaques and glial cells, we identify genes, pathways, and cell communication differences associated with distinct plaque-glia niches, shedding light on the cellular and molecular environments of plaque-related neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that low-Aβ areas, enriched for diffuse plaques, are more neurotoxic than high-Aβ areas and an increased abundance of reactive glia in plaque-glia niches exacerbates neurodegeneration. The glial response genes we identified by ST are enriched for multiple MG states identified by snRNA-seq of human AD brains. Importantly, exposure of co-cultured iMLCs to Aβ oligomers recapitulates the ST glial transcriptional response, as well as the reported MG states in human AD brains.\nBy contrasting low Aβ and high Aβ spots, we detected transcriptomic changes indicative of increased synaptic degeneration in the low Aβ spots. First, our DEG and GSEA analysis identified genes and functional pathways related to synaptic degeneration. Second, our NICHES analysis reveals more drastic LR differences related to neuronal and synaptic degeneration in the low Aβ spots. Third, our IHC validation experiment shows increased cleaved caspase-3 puncta co-localized with NeuN + nuclei and total nuclei near low Aβ plaques compared to high Aβ plaques. Thus, all our results point toward more detrimental effects in low Aβ spots. It is possible that we detected increased apoptosis and neuronal degeneration signatures in low Aβ spots because vulnerable neurons near high Aβ spots have already undergone cell death. This is consistent with our finding that the number of NeuN + nuclei is lower surrounding high Aβ plaques after normalizing by plaque area (Fig.\nThis observation is also concordant with a recent label-free vibrational imaging study showing that early-stage plaques consist mainly of toxic Aβ oligomers and protofibrils, whereas late-stage plaques primarily contain Aβ fibrils [\nAnother interesting observation gleaned from contrasting low Aβ and high Aβ spots is that surrounding glial cells influence the local transcriptome. For example, we detected an upregulation of ECM pathways in the glia-low condition and an upregulation of immune and apoptotic pathways in the glia-high condition (Fig.\nTo examine the effect of surrounding glia in the local plaque-glia niches, we contrasted glia-high versus glia-low spots in the low Aβ and high Aβ conditions. Our analysis indicates that the surrounding glia may mount a robust inflammatory response and exacerbate neurodegeneration, especially in the low Aβ spots. Our IHC validation experiments further validated this result, showing reduced neuronal/synaptic and increased inflammation marker expressions near glia-high plaques compared with glia-low plaques (Fig.\nFurthermore, our GSEA analysis shows that the ST glial response is enriched for signatures of reported mouse gene modules of plaque-induced genes (PIG), oligodendrocyte (OLIG) response, disease-associated microglia (DAM), and disease-associated astrocytes (DAA), as well as different microglia (MG) states identified in human AD brains, indicating that multiple glial cell states arise around plaques and contribute to local immune response. Among all the enriched MG states, MG3 is the most enriched in the ST glial response. This MG state has been shown to resemble mouse DAM and expresses inflammatory genes enriched for cytokine production, antigen presentation, and microglial activation [\nThe iPSC-derived microglia have been shown to recapitulate disease microglia states upon exposure to AD-related stimuli and master regulators [\nOur study demonstrates how advanced ST technology can be effectively combined with classical histology to address questions that neither approach can answer alone. This integrated workflow and computational framework offer a novel and accessible method for investigating pathological heterogeneity in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. By coupling ST data with traditional Aβ IHC staining, we provide new insights into the brain’s cellular and spatial context, linking the abundance of plaques and nearby reactive glia to neuronal vulnerability, synaptic degeneration, and inflammatory responses. Our study also highlights the power of integrating ST, snRNA-seq, and human cell models to decipher the sequential events and cell states in plaque-glia niches, indicating that diverse microglial activation states arise around Aβ plaques and that microglial response to toxic Aβ oligomers initiates glial activation. Overall, our research lays the groundwork for future pathology genomics, opening new avenues for addressing pathological heterogeneity in neurodegenerative diseases. Future studies with increased sample size and diversity, high-resolution spatial profiling platforms, the ability to work with fixed/archived tissues, and co-detection of proteins on the same section will address many technical challenges we encountered and enable finer delineation of cell-type-specific responses to distinct pathologies.\nThere were several limitations of this study. First, our ST samples were collected from aged female individuals (mean age of 92). Therefore, whether our results can generalize to younger age groups or males remains to be determined. Second, because Aβ spots primarily came from AD cases, we were underpowered to assess the intersection of AD status with the detected transcriptional signatures in plaque-glia niches. Third, as the Visium platform is at ~ 55-μm resolution and both astrocytes and microglia accompanied most plaque-containing spots, we were also underpowered to analyze astrocyte- and microglia-specific transcriptional responses in plaque niches. Fourth, due to frequent freezing artifacts of postmortem frozen tissue and the large size of this dataset (258,986 spots), we could not definitively categorize some of the plaques as the diffuse, compact, or dense core; thus, we used no, low and high Aβ to group the ST spots instead. Fifth, because of the relatively low resolution of the Visium platform and the limitation to choosing three proteins for IHC, we focused on extracellular Aβ pathology and surrounding glia to investigate the Aβ-glia niches. Future studies will investigate molecular responses to intracellular pathologies, such as neurofibrillary tangles, using high-resolution ST platforms. Finally, although our Aβ-treated microglia-like cells recapitulate major immune pathways and map partially to ex vivo microglial states, cultured microglia are known to diverge transcriptionally from in vivo microglia due to the absence of brain-specific environmental cues [\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary file1 (XLSX 149 KB)\nSupplementary file2 (XLSX 754 KB)\nSupplementary file3 (XLSX 610 KB)\nSupplementary file4 (XLSX 17 KB)\nSupplementary file5 (XLSX 18 KB)\nSupplementary file6 (XLSX 99 KB)\nSupplementary file7 (XLSX 40 KB)\nSupplementary file8 (XLSX 1665 KB)\nSupplementary file9 (CSV 57 KB)\nSupplementary file10 (XLSX 3431 KB)\nSupplementary file11 (XLSX 2087 KB)\nSupplementary file12 (XLSX 3568 KB)\nSupplementary file13 (XLSX 6085 KB)\nSupplementary file14 (DOCX 6.62 MB)", "content_for_embedding": "A defining pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques.

We chose all female individuals because there were insufficient males in the ROSMAP cohort matching our selection criteria (e.g. RIN > 5, age-matched, minimal freezing artifacts in frozen DLPFC). Frozen brain blocks of the right-hemisphere DLPFC from 21 individuals were cut (~ 1 cm\nFrozen brain blocks were embedded in OCT and cryosectioned coronally to a thickness of 10 μm using a Leica CM1950 cryostat set at −17C. Sectioning was done in sets of three (middle section for ST and two adjacent sections for IF), with 10–50 μm between each set. Sections were attached to Visium slides and stored at −80C in a slide mailer for up to one week before proceeding with spatial transcriptomics. ST-adjacent sections were attached to pre-labeled Leica superfrost plus slides and stored at −80C in slide mailers for up to two weeks before proceeding with immunohistochemistry.\nSpatial Transcriptomics was performed according to the Visium Spatial Gene Expression User Guide (10X Genomics;\nWe first attempted to perform IHC staining on the ST section, following 10X Genomics recommendations. However, due to the modified protocol required to preserve RNA integrity (i.e., methanol instead of PFA fixation, no antigen retrieval, shorter blocking, and antibody incubations), we were unable to obtain adequate staining quality. We decided instead to perform IHC on two ST-adjacent sections. Cryosectioned tissue on Leica super-frost slides was transferred from −80C to the lab on dry ice and quickly thawed for 1 min on a heat block at 37 C, then immediately transferred to a slide-mailer filled with PFA pre-equilibrated to 4 C and fixed at 4 C for 20 min. Slides were washed twice with DPBS before performing antigen retrieval for 10 min @ 95 C in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Following antigen retrieval, slides were washed three times with DPBS, a hydrophobic barrier was drawn surrounding the tissue (two sections per slide), and then sections were blocked for 1 h at RT in blocking buffer (DPBS containing 5% normal goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, and Human TruStain FcX (Fc blocker)). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies to detect Aβ (4G8), GFAP, and IBA1 (diluted in blocking buffer). The next day, the primary antibody solution was removed, and sections were washed three times with DPBS (5 min per wash). Sections were then incubated for 1.5 h at RT in the dark with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 for Aβ, Alexa Fluor 790 for GFAP, and Alexa Fluor 594 for IBA1) diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer. The secondary antibody solution was removed, and sections were washed four times with DPBS (5 min per wash), then incubated with DAPI to stain nuclei and Trueblack (according to the manufacturer’s instructions) to quench tissue autofluorescence. Slides were coverslipped and imaged on the ThermoFisher CellInsight CX7 LZR High Content Analysis Platform (HCA; 100 16-bit images per section).\nH&E images were acquired from ST sections with an Eclipse Ti2-E microscope (Nikon) at 20 × magnification in 9 × 9 tile tiff files with 10% overlap and were stitched into a single image per section with Adobe Photoshop (23.4.2 release). We note that some patches not covered by tissue could not be stitched, but tissue-covered areas were unaffected. To verify this, we confirmed alignment of spot coordinates to the H&E image. Fluorescent Aβ, GFAP, IBA1, and DAPI images were acquired from the two adjacent sections with the ThermoFisher HCA at 20 × magnification in 10 × 10 tile 16-bit tiff files. Background and shading correction were performed with the ImageJ plugin BaSiC [\nDue to the non-uniform intensity background across tiles and bright areas arising from artifacts such as tissue wrinkles and tears, we applied standard image processing techniques for further background correction and artifact removal. Using a structural element with a size well above that of amyloid plaques, microglia, and astrocytes, for each IF image, we performed grayscale opening and closing to extract large bright artifacts and local background inhomogeneity, which we regressed out from the image. With the artifact-corrected IHC images, we quantified the amount of amyloid, microglia, and astrocytes by averaging the intensity of pixels within each spot of the ST sections. We excluded spots near tissue borders overlapping with bright artifacts from our analysis.\nFFPE cortical sections were pre-heated for 60 min at 60 C in a dry oven and then rehydrated using a series of xylene and ethanol dilutions before rehydrating in DI water. Sections were then used for performing antigen retrieval for 20 min in boiling 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Following antigen retrieval, sections were washed with DPBS, incubated in 0.02N HCl for 20 min for peroxide blocking, washed with DPBS, and blocked for 1 h at RT in TNB blocking buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.5% Akoya blocking reagent; prepared as per manufacturer's instructions). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies diluted in the TNB blocking buffer to detect combinations of Aβ (4G8; 1:1000), GFAP (1:1500), IBA1 (1:200), cleaved Caspase-3 (1:250), NeuN (1:100), SYP (1:500) and/or CD68 (1:100). The following day, primary antibody solution was removed from sections, washed three times with TNT wash buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) (5 min per wash) and incubated for 1 h at RT in the dark with species-appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 568, Alexa Fluor 647, Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 790) diluted 1:1000 in DPBS. For cleaved Caspase-3 staining, the antibody was detected with a Mouse IgM-HRP secondary, incubated for 1 h at RT, followed by a 5 min incubation with tyramide Cy5. After secondary antibody incubation, sections were washed three times with TNT wash buffer (5 min per wash), then incubated with Trueblack for 1 min to quench tissue autofluorescence. Slides were washed two times with DPBS (5 min per wash), incubated with Hoechst 34580 (1:2000 in DPBS) for staining nuclei, mounted using Prolong antifade mountant and coverslipped. Slides were dried overnight at RT and imaged on the ThermoFisher HCA (200–300 16-bit images per section).\nIHC stained slides were imaged on the ThermoFisher HCA at 20x. 24 fields per section were selected to profile the thickness of the cortex from the meninges to the white matter for each subject. Images were processed using the compartmental analysis module in the HCA software. After background correction, 4G8 staining was used to identify plaque-like objects with the following parameters: objectarea > 20 μm, smoothing = 2. The 4G8-based objects were used as a mask to generate a region of interest (ROI) for the GFAP and IBA1 channels that encompassed both the object area and an extension from the edge of each object up to 25 μm without overlap. Calculated metrics, including the average ROI intensity for each channel, object size, and object shape, and counts were exported from the software. The data was filtered for an average 4G8 intensity > 2000. To adjust for technical differences in staining intensities between slides, the intensity data was scaled and centered for each case, and these resulting z-scores were used for subsequent plots. To classify plaques, an investigator blinded to the HCA measurements manually scored all 4G8-based objects as diffuse, compact, or dense core plaques (or as a staining artifact or vessel Aβ, both of which were excluded) yielding a final sample size of n = 722 plaques from n = 9 cases. For target intensity measurements, either the compartmental or colocalization analysis modules of the CellInsight system were used to define secondary objects and extract the average intensity and counts within each ROI. The top 25% of 4G8-based objects based on the scaled average 4G8 intensity was defined as high Aβ and the lower 75% as low Aβ. Objects with an ROI scoring in the top 25% for either scaled GFAP or scaled IBA1 average intensities were defined as glia-high and the remaining objects as glia-low. For NeuN (n = 10)/SYP(n = 9) (Fig.\nSequencing data were pre-processed with Space Ranger pipeline (10 × Genomics), which mapped the barcodes against the human genome (Gencode 27), generated FASTQ files, and generated a count matrix for each section. The individual files were then merged in a Seurat object (Seurat v4.2.0) and were processed in R. We calculated per-spot quality metrics and spots with low-measured genes (< 500) were removed. The Seurat::SCTransform function was used to normalize and scale the UMI counts based on regularized negative binomial regression. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the top 3000 variable genes. Using the top 50 PCs (Supplementary Fig.\nBenchmarking of data integration methods was performed using the\nDownsampling to 16 sections was performed using Seurat::Subset on the full dataset. Seurat pipeline was run as described above, resulting in 10 clusters that were manually annotated based on their similarity to those generated from the full dataset. BayesSpace was run with standard settings after merging all 16 sections into a single object (but with sections made spatially isolated from each other). Upon inspection of the qPlot (Supplementary Fig.\nWe performed co-expression network analysis using all spots and sections of the ST data. We created a pseudo-bulk gene expression matrix by summing the counts by donor. The lowly expressed genes were removed, and we kept genes with at least 1 CPM (counts per million) in all samples.

We only kept expressed genes with counts per million (CPM) > 1 in at least 80% of the brain sections. With the pseudobulk estimates, we estimated the library sizes of the brain sections using the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) of edgeR [\nFor interpretation, we applied GSEA [\nThe abundance of specific brain cell types was estimated for each ST spot using cell2location [\nLocal microenvironment interactions were estimated from ST data using NICHES (Niche Interactions and Communication Heterogeneity in Extracellular Signaling v1.0.0) [\nTwo iPSC lines (AICS-0090–391 purchased from the Coriell Institute and BR28 [\nTo generate iMGL, we followed previously published protocols [\nTo generate astrocyte/neuron cultures, we first differentiated BR28 iPSCs into neural progenitors (NPCs). iPSCs were dissociated with accutase and replated to Matrigel-coated plates at 2.5 × 10\nAmyloid-beta (Aβ\nDay 38 iMGL were collected and replated onto day 68 astrocyte/neuron cultures in STEMdiff astrocyte maturation media supplemented with M-CSF (25 ng/ml), IL-34 (100 ng/ml),TGFβ−1 (50 ng/ml), CD200 (100 ng/mL) and CX3CL1 (100 ng/mL) at a ratio of 1:4. Cells were co-cultured for 72 h prior to treatment with 50ug/ml oligomeric-Aβ or vehicle. After 24 h, both adherent and suspension cell fractions were collected, washed with PBS, and dissociated with accutase. Cells were washed in wash buffer [PBS, 2% BSA, 0.2U/μl RNAse inhibitor] and centrifuged at 300xg for 5 min at 4 °C, then filtered through 70 Flowmi strainers. Cells were counted using trypan blue on a Countess II (Invitrogen).\nWe prepared separate libraries from both the adherent and suspension cell fractions using 10X Genomics 3’ single-cell gene expression assays v3 and sequenced them on a NovaSeq 6000 to a depth of 50 k reads/cell. Following sequencing and FASTQ generation, raw count matrices were produced using CellRanger v6.0.1. The resulting count matrices were corrected for ambient RNA using CellBender [\nWe obtained 1 cm\nSpatial Transcriptomics Profiles of Postmortem DLPFC from 21 individuals.\nTo determine the layer identities of ST spots, we first normalized the ST data using SCTransform [\nUsing a published single-nuclei RNA-seq dataset of the DLPFC [\nAs a data quality check, we compared the co-expression patterns of our ST data against that of bulk RNASeq data from the DLPFC of 478 individuals [\nWe collected two adjacent sections for each ST section and stained them for Aβ, GFAP, and IBA1. We used GFAP and IBA1 because studies show that increased expression of GFAP [\nTo investigate the effects of Aβ plaques, we first stratified the 258,986 ST spots into three groups: no, low, and high Aβ, based on the average fluorescence intensity of Aβ in the corresponding 55-μm-diameter area from the two adjacent IHC stained sections (Fig.\nStratification of tissue microdomains by adjacent-section IHC intensities.\nTo examine the transcriptomic effects of Aβ, we first summed the expression values of all gray matter spots within a brain section for each stratified spot group (Fig.\nDifferential effects of low vs. high Aβ on the local transcriptome.\nGSEA on the low versus high Aβ contrasts shows reduced synaptic functions (Fig.\nFurthermore, we performed GSEA with specific genesets relevant to plaque-glia niches (Fig.\nAt the gene level, we detected lower expression of neuronal (\nTo examine differential Aβ effects on intercellular communications, we used NICHES [\nAβ plaques influence intercellular communication.\nTo test whether plaque-surrounding glia influences the local transcriptome within plaque-glia niches, we contrasted the glia-high versus glia-low gray matter spots with and without stratification by Aβ intensity (Fig.\nDifferential effects of glia abundance on the local transcriptome.\nTo assess the independent effects of astrocytes or microglia, we stratified and labeled spots based on the intensities of A-beta, GFAP and IBA1. For example, HHL denotes high A-beta, high GFAP, and low IBA1, respectively. We examined four contrasts: HHL vs. HLL, HLH vs. HLL, LHL vs. LLL, and LLH vs. LLL. After retaining brain sections with at least 50 spots for pseudobulk analysis, the number of available individuals per group was limited: 1 (HHL), 6 (HLH), 5 (HLL), 5 (LHL), 11 (LLH), and 15 (LLL). Due to these limited sample sizes, we detected minimal DEGs, except for LHL vs. LLL contrast, which revealed 133 DEGs. (Supplementary Table 9).\nDepending on the Aβ conditions, we detected different gene expression changes and geneset enrichment. Under the low Aβ condition, expression of genes related to lysosome/autophagy (\nIn addition to gene ontology (GO), we further applied GSEA with gene signatures of PIG [\nWe then set out to validate the synaptic and neuronal loss in the high-glia spots. To this end, we stained FFPE sections from 10 AD individuals with Aβ, GFAP, and IBA1 and synaptophysin (SYP) to label synapses or NeuN to label neuronal nuclei (Fig.\nWe again applied NICHES to estimate differences in microenvironments centering around each ST spot. We first contrasted glia-high versus glia-low to identify differentially expressed LRs under low Aβ, high Aβ, and combined conditions (Supplementary Table 8). We observed a positive correlation (R = 0.41) between the low Aβ and high Aβ conditions. The expression of LRs related to synaptic pathways (\nPlaque-surrounding reactive glia modifies intercellular communication.\nStudies have shown that Aβ plaques are potential reservoirs of oligomeric Aβ, often forming a\"halo\"around Aβ plaques [\nAβ oligomer treatment of co-cultured iMGL partially recapitulates ST glia response to Aβ plaques.\nWe acquired scRNA-seq data from 13,740 cells under the Aβ untreated and treated conditions. After standard data processing and filtering, we applied unsupervised clustering on the first 15 principal components to group the cells (Supplementary Fig. 10 C). We identified 5 major cell clusters that we annotated based on classical markers as iMGLs, astrocytes, neurons, cycling neuroglial progenitors, and other progenitors (Fig.\nWe then further divided the Aβ-treated iMGLs into 4 subclusters (iMGL1-4; Fig.\nWhile Aβ plaques and reactive glia have long been known to be associated with neurodegeneration, their interaction effects on local transcriptomes have not been extensively studied using ST. Here, we report paired ST-IHC measurements across 78 samples from 21 ROSMAP individuals. This large sample size enables statistical inference of Aβ and glial effects that are not merely observed in a limited sample size. By coupling ST readouts with IHC features of Aβ plaques and glial cells, we identify genes, pathways, and cell communication differences associated with distinct plaque-glia niches, shedding light on the cellular and molecular environments of plaque-related neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that low-Aβ areas, enriched for diffuse plaques, are more neurotoxic than high-Aβ areas and an increased abundance of reactive glia in plaque-glia niches exacerbates neurodegeneration. The glial response genes we identified by ST are enriched for multiple MG states identified by snRNA-seq of human AD brains. Importantly, exposure of co-cultured iMLCs to Aβ oligomers recapitulates the ST glial transcriptional response, as well as the reported MG states in human AD brains.\nBy contrasting low Aβ and high Aβ spots, we detected transcriptomic changes indicative of increased synaptic degeneration in the low Aβ spots. First, our DEG and GSEA analysis identified genes and functional pathways related to synaptic degeneration. Second, our NICHES analysis reveals more drastic LR differences related to neuronal and synaptic degeneration in the low Aβ spots. Third, our IHC validation experiment shows increased cleaved caspase-3 puncta co-localized with NeuN + nuclei and total nuclei near low Aβ plaques compared to high Aβ plaques. Thus, all our results point toward more detrimental effects in low Aβ spots. It is possible that we detected increased apoptosis and neuronal degeneration signatures in low Aβ spots because vulnerable neurons near high Aβ spots have already undergone cell death. This is consistent with our finding that the number of NeuN + nuclei is lower surrounding high Aβ plaques after normalizing by plaque area (Fig.\nThis observation is also concordant with a recent label-free vibrational imaging study showing that early-stage plaques consist mainly of toxic Aβ oligomers and protofibrils, whereas late-stage plaques primarily contain Aβ fibrils [\nAnother interesting observation gleaned from contrasting low Aβ and high Aβ spots is that surrounding glial cells influence the local transcriptome. For example, we detected an upregulation of ECM pathways in the glia-low condition and an upregulation of immune and apoptotic pathways in the glia-high condition (Fig.\nTo examine the effect of surrounding glia in the local plaque-glia niches, we contrasted glia-high versus glia-low spots in the low Aβ and high Aβ conditions. Our analysis indicates that the surrounding glia may mount a robust inflammatory response and exacerbate neurodegeneration, especially in the low Aβ spots. Our IHC validation experiments further validated this result, showing reduced neuronal/synaptic and increased inflammation marker expressions near glia-high plaques compared with glia-low plaques (Fig.\nFurthermore, our GSEA analysis shows that the ST glial response is enriched for signatures of reported mouse gene modules of plaque-induced genes (PIG), oligodendrocyte (OLIG) response, disease-associated microglia (DAM), and disease-associated astrocytes (DAA), as well as different microglia (MG) states identified in human AD brains, indicating that multiple glial cell states arise around plaques and contribute to local immune response. Among all the enriched MG states, MG3 is the most enriched in the ST glial response. This MG state has been shown to resemble mouse DAM and expresses inflammatory genes enriched for cytokine production, antigen presentation, and microglial activation [\nThe iPSC-derived microglia have been shown to recapitulate disease microglia states upon exposure to AD-related stimuli and master regulators [\nOur study demonstrates how advanced ST technology can be effectively combined with classical histology to address questions that neither approach can answer alone. This integrated workflow and computational framework offer a novel and accessible method for investigating pathological heterogeneity in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. By coupling ST data with traditional Aβ IHC staining, we provide new insights into the brain’s cellular and spatial context, linking the abundance of plaques and nearby reactive glia to neuronal vulnerability, synaptic degeneration, and inflammatory responses. Our study also highlights the power of integrating ST, snRNA-seq, and human cell models to decipher the sequential events and cell states in plaque-glia niches, indicating that diverse microglial activation states arise around Aβ plaques and that microglial response to toxic Aβ oligomers initiates glial activation. Overall, our research lays the groundwork for future pathology genomics, opening new avenues for addressing pathological heterogeneity in neurodegenerative diseases. Future studies with increased sample size and diversity, high-resolution spatial profiling platforms, the ability to work with fixed/archived tissues, and co-detection of proteins on the same section will address many technical challenges we encountered and enable finer delineation of cell-type-specific responses to distinct pathologies.\nThere were several limitations of this study. First, our ST samples were collected from aged female individuals (mean age of 92). Therefore, whether our results can generalize to younger age groups or males remains to be determined. Second, because Aβ spots primarily came from AD cases, we were underpowered to assess the intersection of AD status with the detected transcriptional signatures in plaque-glia niches. Third, as the Visium platform is at ~ 55-μm resolution and both astrocytes and microglia accompanied most plaque-containing spots, we were also underpowered to analyze astrocyte- and microglia-specific transcriptional responses in plaque niches. Fourth, due to frequent freezing artifacts of postmortem frozen tissue and the large size of this dataset (258,986 spots), we could not definitively categorize some of the plaques as the diffuse, compact, or dense core; thus, we used no, low and high Aβ to group the ST spots instead. Fifth, because of the relatively low resolution of the Visium platform and the limitation to choosing three proteins for IHC, we focused on extracellular Aβ pathology and surrounding glia to investigate the Aβ-glia niches. Future studies will investigate molecular responses to intracellular pathologies, such as neurofibrillary tangles, using high-resolution ST platforms. Finally, although our Aβ-treated microglia-like cells recapitulate major immune pathways and map partially to ex vivo microglial states, cultured microglia are known to diverge transcriptionally from in vivo microglia due to the absence of brain-specific environmental cues [\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary file1 (XLSX 149 KB)\nSupplementary file2 (XLSX 754 KB)\nSupplementary file3 (XLSX 610 KB)\nSupplementary file4 (XLSX 17 KB)\nSupplementary file5 (XLSX 18 KB)\nSupplementary file6 (XLSX 99 KB)\nSupplementary file7 (XLSX 40 KB)\nSupplementary file8 (XLSX 1665 KB)\nSupplementary file9 (CSV 57 KB)\nSupplementary file10 (XLSX 3431 KB)\nSupplementary file11 (XLSX 2087 KB)\nSupplementary file12 (XLSX 3568 KB)\nSupplementary file13 (XLSX 6085 KB)\nSupplementary file14 (DOCX 6.62 MB)", "topic": "Alzheimer_Disease"}

The knowledge about NBR and its medical translation is limited. This study highlights the importance of the NBR in aging and AD research, considering evidence regarding its impairment before irreversible neurodegeneration when therapy may still be useful. In summary, NBR’s pattern is impaired in aging adults, and it is even more disturbed in pathological aging, including MCI, AD, and early tau and amyloid deposition. We highlight the importance of NBR in the functional imaging studies of aging and neurodegeneration, and advocate for translating it into medicine. We also discuss the difficulties, heterogeneities, and challenges found in this field in our review.\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized our understanding of brain neurophysiology, hemodynamics, and function [\nThe temporal dynamic of the PBR’s hemodynamic response function (HRF) is now fully characterized. It has been used for many years [\nThe regions where negative BOLD responses (NBR) are often detected. (1) Default mode network. The articles discussed here mainly focus on this type of NBR; (2) Areas in the vicinity of the PBR. This usually includes the sensory/motor cortices; (3) The ipsilateral hemisphere. These regions usually show NBR during unilateral sensory/motor stimulation; 4) Ventricles.\nThe DMN was described in 2001 as an organized, baseline functioning network of the brain that is active during rest and during internally directed thoughts, whose activity decreases when attention shifts to external stimuli [\nSignals from DMN regions have been shown to fluctuate at low frequencies but coherently in the absence of external stimulation. This fMRI characteristic is often called functional connectivity (FC) [\nThe rationale for performing this review is the fact that although the last three decades saw a massive expansion of fMRI-based research in the wide range of psychiatric and neurologic disorders [\nSince AD pathologies tend to start accumulating decades before symptoms occur, they may have already taken over the brain prior to symptom onset. Therefore, diagnosis and intervention at earlier stages of the disease are crucial. Any effective pharmacological treatment option for AD requires detecting this disease before devastating neuronal loss and clinically evident symptoms [\ncompares the mean NBR/PBR pattern between young and healthy elderly groups during synonym tb-fMRI. These patterns are shown in voxel-wise surface plots of healthy young (Left panel) and healthy elderly (right Panel). Deactivation decreased, and activations increased throughout aging\nConvincing evidence exists regarding deactivation and activation failure in AD and MCI participants [\nOther rationales for writing this review is our limited knowledge about the NBR signal in general, the lack of evidence evaluating NBR in clinical settings, and limited clinical applications for fMRI. There are many challenges and heterogeneous data in this field. One major obstacle is that existing studies use different cognitive tasks, inclusion criteria, and terminology in reporting deactivation or NBR. Using different terms such as “negative activation,” “reduced activation,” and “decreased activation” is another big problem in this field. Also, many researchers mask NBR, and we believe this only underscores the importance of a holistic understanding of brain functions.\nThis review evaluates clinical research using NBR as an imaging biomarker to evaluate normal cognitive decline (normal aging), MCI, and AD.\nThis study adheres to the latest edition of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [\nThe authors comprehensively searched the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases. Finally, they updated the database search on 6/11/2024, and the snowballing and additional searches on the same day, along with forward and backward citation tracking on Scopus for all the studies published up to 6/11/2024.\nGiven the aim of this review, we first reviewed \"deactivation\" and \"negative bold response\" findings in fMRI studies on MCI, AD, and normal cognitive decline in the literature. Following this research, we decided that \"negative signal change,\" \"negative activation,\" \"deactivation,\" and \"negative bold response\" are used interchangeably. We also found that many articles reported these findings in the manuscript but did not mention them in the abstract or keywords. Alternatively, some researchers reported these negative responses in captions of figures and tables, and they were not mentioned in the main manuscript.\nSince many studies did not mention \"deactivation\" or \"negative BOLD response\" as their keywords or in their abstracts, we selected the following search term to enhance further yield for this systematic review. We used 3 different search term groups.\nOur first search terms were (\"mild cognitive impairment\" OR \"Alzheimer's disease\") AND \"fMRI\" AND \"task\" AND “BOLD.” Our second search terms were \"aging\" AND \"fMRI\" AND \"task\" AND \"BOLD.\" Our third and final search terms were (\"tau\" OR \"amyloid\") AND \"fMRI\" AND \"task.\" We did not include \"BOLD\" in the third search term because it would result in a minimal number of studies, potentially excluding many related studies. We performed this search strategy in the PubMed database with no limits, which resulted in articles from 1999 to 2024.\nWe performed the following search strategies for the first, second, and third search terms using the Embase database, respectively, limiting the results to article types:\n('Mild cognitive impairment':ti,ab,kw OR'Alzheimer’s disease':ti,ab,kw) AND fmri:ti,ab,kw AND task:ti,ab,kw AND bold:ti,ab,kw AND'article'/it\nAging:ti,ab,kw AND fmri:ti,ab,kw AND bold:ti,ab,kw AND task:ti,ab,kw AND'article'/it\n(Tau:ti,ab,kw OR amyloid:ti,ab,kw) AND fmri:ti,ab,kw AND task:ti,ab,kw AND'article'/it\nWe also performed the following search strategies using Scopus database:\nTITLE-ABS-KEY (\"mild cognitive impairment\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (\"alzheimer's disease\") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (task) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (fmri) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (bold) AND LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE,\"ar\")\nTITLE-ABS-KEY (aging) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (fmri) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (task) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (bold) AND LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE,\"ar\")\nTITLE-ABS-KEY (tau) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (amyloid) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (task) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (fmri) AND LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE,\"ar\")\nWe did not include \"deactivation\" or \"negative BOLD response\" in our search to avoid losing articles that did not report these findings in their abstracts or keywords.\nDue to time constraints, the authors employed a single screening method. Single abstract screening misses up to 13% of relevant articles [\nOur first author reviewed the titles and abstracts of all the records and then screened the titles and abstracts of all the articles retrieved. Our last author checked a random sample of screened records. In the case of disagreement, the discussion reached a consensus on which articles to screen for full text.\nWe designed a data extraction form, which 2 review authors used to extract data from eligible studies. The extracted data were compared, with any discrepancies being resolved through discussion.\nEligible outcomes were broadly categorized as follows:\nReports of any measure of deactivation, negative activation, or NBR, or the lack of these signals normally seen in healthy controls, were eligible for inclusion. The tests or diagnostic criteria used in each paper should have had evidence of validity and reliability for assessing MCI, AD, aging, and increased tau or Aβ. Results could be reported as an overall increase, decrease, or constant level of NBR.\nWhere multiple outcomes were reported, we selected one outcome for inclusion in analyses and for reporting the main outcomes, choosing the result that provided the most complete information for analysis. Where multiple results remained, we listed all available outcomes (without results) based on relevance to the review question and the validity and reliability of the measures used.\nWe collected data on:\nThe report: author, year, and source of publication.\nThe study: sample characteristics, social demography, and definition and criteria used for diagnosis.\nThe participants: case group (AD, MCI, HE, or participants with increased tau or Aβ,) control group (HE or healthy young participants (HY)), social situation, time elapsed since diagnosis, history of psychiatric or other neurologic illness, current neurological status, current treatment mental impairment, and history of coronary artery disease or risk factors.\nThe research design and features: sampling mechanism, deactivation/activation patterns, length of follow-up if applicable, type of the utilized task, and type of PET imaging contrast.\nGiven the complexities of different tasks and methods being investigated, we attempted to categorize the results among different participants. We created categories of results based on the below dimensions:\nNBR patterns in AD patients\nNBR patterns in MCI patients\nNBR patterns in aging\nTau or Aβ deposition and NBR\nSome studies showed contradictory results (e.g., an increase in the magnitude of NBR in DMN in Aging). We did not exclude those articles; we will describe them in greater detail in the results and discussion sections regarding the task being used.\nStudies were classified based on whether they showed a reduction in the magnitude of NBR, no effect, or an increase in the magnitude of NBR during task performance. Considering the heterogeneity of data and the different nature of tasks and contrasts (Hard vs. Easy or Task vs. Resting-State) being used and various characteristics of each group (eg, age, mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)), conducting a meta-analysis was not possible. The statistical approach used, therefore, was to consider the significance levels (P values) before entering studies. The rationale for this choice is that all the articles reported the same broad question, ie, ‘What is the deactivation/activation pattern during this task in each group?'. Using this approach, the null hypothesis tested is that task performance has no significant effect on NBR in any of the considered articles. If the null hypothesis is rejected, we can conclude that there is a non-null effect in at least one study. If the results are interpreted with sufficient precaution, this approach can combine results from very dissimilar trials with differing outcomes and statistical tests.\nWe performed exploratory analyses to determine whether different characteristics varied the effects of the interventions. The authors evaluated the P values before including the articles. Researchers used different tasks. We examined whether this other kind of task modified, on average, the effect of the interventions.\nWe did not use any tools or systematic approaches to summarize each intervention strategy's findings. However, the authors independently assessed the certainty of evidence to conclude the certainty of the evidence. We resolved disagreements on certainty by discussion.\nThe identified articles employed numerous cognitive, sensory, and motor tasks. While an exhaustive description of these tasks is beyond the scope of this study, we briefly describe some of the most used tasks within 9 different categories in supplementary material 1. However, readers are encouraged to consult the original studies for further details.\nOur first search criterion returned 249 records in the databases. After duplicate removals, we screened 159 records and reviewed 86 full-text manuscripts. Finally, 9 articles met our inclusion criteria. Next, our forward and backward search in documents that cited any of the initially identified studies, and the references of the initially identified studies, resulted in 55 studies, making the total included manuscripts 64. (A flowchart for this search is shown in Fig.\nPRISMA flow diagram regarding the third search strategy\nWe found 642 records in the databases searching for our second criterion. After duplicate removals, we screened 319 records and reviewed 197 full-text manuscripts. Finally, 42 articles met our inclusion criteria. Later, we searched documents that cited any of the initially identified articles as well as the references of the initially identified articles, which resulted in 44 more inclusions, making the total manuscripts 86 (as seen in Fig.\nPRISMA flow diagram regarding the first search strategy\nBy searching the third criterion, we found 337 records in the databases. After duplicate removals, we screened 154 records and reviewed 84 full-text manuscripts. Finally, 14 articles met our criteria. Later, we searched documents that cited any of the initially identified papers as well as their references. Our search resulted in 3 more articles, making the final identified 17 articles (as shown in Fig.\nPRISMA flow diagram regarding the second search strategy\nWe did not exclude any studies that met the inclusion criteria from our review.\nThe most observed finding in these studies is the decrease in the magnitude of NBR through aging. It is mainly seen within various DMN regions. Also, there might be an increased magnitude of activation instead of the expected NBR across different brain regions. These are reported using a variety of tasks. Fifty-eight articles confirmed suppression in the NBR of some DMN regions. This suppression is not necessarily limited to DMN regions and may extend to regions outside the DMN. Some of the tasks these studies use include, but are not limited to, semantic classification, N-back, and face-name pair tasks [\nThese findings are not limited to DMN areas, as they have also been observed in other brain regions in 8 studies. These regions include the left auditory cortex during a face encoding task, [\nTwelve studies have explored the association between task difficulty and the NBR change rate. Eight studies reported changes in DMN, using various tasks, including but not limited to N-back tasks, distance-judgement tasks, and verb-generation tasks. These studies showed that HE exhibits a lower rate of change in the DMN’s NBR compared to HY. Furthermore, this disturbance was not limited to classical DMN regions [\nAdditionally, many studies have evaluated the relationship between the magnitude of NBR and performance in elderly populations. Reduced NBR magnitude in HE corresponds to worse performance in 8 articles, mainly using N-back, face-name pair, and distance judgment tasks [\nWhile most studies have used cognitive tasks to explore deactivation/activation patterns through aging, some studies employed motor tasks to that end. Many studies have demonstrated the reduced magnitude of NBR and even changing to PBR with aging in various brain regions, including the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1), [\nWhile we mostly discussed the reduction in the magnitude of DMN’s NBR in this review paper, there are reports of increased magnitude of NBR in HE participants, which are not necessarily in the same regions. Therefore, in this paragraph, we discuss the results of those studies and the possible reasons behind these contradictory findings. Aging might be associated with increased and decreased NBR within different regions, as it was associated with increased magnitude of right superior parietal gyrus NBR during N-back. However, HE did not deactivate the middle frontal gyrus, but HY did [\nSome articles found no age-related differences in NBR using a multi-factorial memory task [\nMost studies suggest a failure to deactivate the DMN as people age, which can manifest as either reduced or absent NBR magnitude. Instead of the usual NBR seen in HY, this failure might even present as activation in HE. This NBR’s failure in the DMN is generally associated with poorer task performance, especially during more challenging tasks. Failure is not always confined to the DMN and can affect other brain areas. However, some studies have observed an increased NBR magnitude in HE compared to HY. These differences might be due to disease stage variations among participants, factors like apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, or higher levels of Aβ or tau. Different technical methods for generating activation/deactivation patterns could also contribute to these conflicting results.\nThe most common finding in these studies is the reduced magnitude of the NBR from DMN found in association with higher and earlier Aβ burden. Nine studies using various tasks, including face-name pairs, executive contextual, and gist tasks, showed that Aβ deposition is associated with either a decrease in the magnitude of the NBR mainly from some DMN regions, or increased brain activity in regions, including some of the DMN regions that usually deactivated across HY and Aβ negative HE participants [\nThis increased magnitude of brain activity was associated with poorer performance [\nAlso, one study reported no effect of Aβ deposition in aging on the DMN’s NBR during a Visual Scene Recognition task. Their cut-off was PIB DVR of 1.08 [\nThe failure of deactivation in the DMN is shown to be related to the progression of tau pathology. Aberrant neural activity may be a crucial process driving remote Aβ and tau interactions. AD pathologies have been shown to alter interactions between the DMN and the medial temporal lobe (MTL), changing them from suppression of neural activity to increased activation. With increasing Aβ levels, the DMN becomes hyperexcitable, leading to hyperexcitability in the MTL and subsequent tau accumulation in EC [\nThere is also evidence regarding the decreasing magnitude of DMN’s NBR with AD-related CSF pathology in two studies. During a delayed match to sample task and a scene encoding task, a lower magnitude of NBR in DMN was linked with higher AD CSF pathology [\nThere is convincing evidence regarding the impacts of AD pathology and the reduced magnitude of NBR or the increased magnitude of PBR on each other. There is compelling data about increasing Aβ levels in CSF or higher burden in PET causing these changes in BOLD response, especially in DMN regions. This increased magnitude of activation or reduced magnitude of NBR may eventually result in increased tau deposition, which in turn may cause increments in activation itself. Overall, like AD, MCI, and HE, reduced NBR magnitude is mainly shown to be associated with poorer task performance.\nIn these studies, decreased magnitude of the NBR through aging is the most common finding. Seventeen studies investigating the change in the fMRI signal from the DMN during tasks such as the N-back, attention network test, and face encoding consistently reported a reduction in the magnitude of the NBR in MCI patients or even reported PBR in the DMN, where usually NBR is observed in healthy controls [\nA few studies reported the relationship between task difficulty and the change in the magnitude of the NBR from the DMN. Using the verbal N-back task, HE deactivated the amygdala more significantly with a higher task load, whereas MCI patients activated the amygdala under both low and high-load conditions [\nAlthough most studies reviewed here generally reported reduced magnitude of NBR, some studies showed an increase in the magnitude of the NBR in the DMN of the MCI patients, conversely. In this paragraph, we discuss this phenomenon. For instance, semantic and phonemic tasks increased NBR’s magnitude in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, and IPL [\nFinally, a few studies reported no change in the NBR from the DMN of the MCI patients or showed mixed results. Studies using face-name pair tasks and visual item memory tasks found no significant difference in NBR between HE and MCI, probably due to patients being in the early stages of MCI or having stable MCI [\nAltogether, it appears that most studies have shown a deactivation failure within the DMN in MCI participants compared to HE. This failure manifests itself consistently as a reduced NBR magnitude or absent deactivation. Also, deactivation failure of DMN may even appear as PBR instead of the normally expected NBR observed in HE. This deactivation failure in DMN is mainly correlated with poorer performance during tasks or more impairment, evident in scales such as MDRS. In addition, deactivation failure of the DMN may become more apparent when using more challenging tasks than easier ones. Interestingly, deactivation failure is not always confined to classical DMN and may involve other areas as well. However, some studies have reported increased NBR magnitude in MCI patients compared to HE. The reason behind these findings may be differences in stages of disease, and other confounding factors like APOE or higher levels of Aβ or tau in these groups. Other possible reasons are different technical methods for generating deactivation/activation patterns.\nThe most common finding in these studies was the reduced magnitude of the NBR in the DMN in AD patients. Fourteen studies using various tasks, including semantic classification, face-encoding, and face-name pairs tasks, reported a reduction in the magnitude of some DMN regions’ NBR or an increased magnitude of the PBR instead of the NBR seen in HE from the DMN of AD patients compared with HE or HY [\nA few studies, like those involving MCI patients, analyzed how increasing task difficulty changes the magnitude of the DMN’s NBR. AD patients continued to activate the DMN during the attention network test even as the difficulty increased, unlike HE, who showed NBR [\nIn contrast to the previous results, some studies have observed a higher NBR magnitude in AD patients. These studies did not agree with the generally decreased deactivation reported in patients. This conflict might be because none of these studies have reported correction for tau or Aβ. Also, this could be due to the different cognition statuses and genetics of participants, or their gender. Namely, using the verbal fluency task, the AD group showed more NBR magnitude compared to HE in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, and IPL [\nEight articles compared AD and MCI patients during the task fMRI, and they reported a reduced NBR magnitude or increased PBR magnitude in some DMN areas of AD patients compared to MCI patients. However, when compared to HY or HE, both patient groups exhibited a reduced magnitude of NBR. These studies employed various tasks, such as face-name pairs, olfactory, and word list tasks [\nUnlike the studies reporting a linear pattern in the AD continuum, studies report an inverted U-shaped or quadratic pattern of deactivation/activation in the continuum of AD pathology. This pattern starts as NBR in HE, which becomes a higher magnitude of PBR or reduced NBR magnitude in early MCI, and finally changes to a lesser PBR magnitude or higher NBR magnitude in participants with progressed disease. During a visual associative memory encoding task, patients with subjective cognitive decline plus (SCD+) (who had smaller hippocampal volumes and/or APOE ε4 allele) exhibited a higher magnitude of activation in the left superior parietal lobule, right precuneus, and bilateral middle temporal lobes. In contrast, a lesser magnitude of PBR or NBR was observed in MCI patients and HE, forming an inverted U-shaped model [\nUsing face-name pairs, less impaired MCI participants showed an increased magnitude of PBR in the hippocampus compared to the NBR observed in HE. Conversely, more impaired MCI participants demonstrated a reduced magnitude of PBR, akin to the levels observed in the mild AD participants. Additionally, in patients with MCI and AD, the deactivation failure in these regions was associated with increased PBR in a neocortical attentional network [\nOverall, it seems that most studies have indicated a failure to deactivate some of the DMN regions in individuals with AD compared to HE. This failure typically appears as either reduced or absent NBR. This failure might even present as activation instead of the usual NBR seen in healthy individuals. The deactivation failure in the DMN is generally linked to poorer task performance or more significant cognitive impairment. Moreover, this failure tends to be more pronounced during more challenging tasks. Like MCI patients, failure is not always restricted to the DMN and can affect other areas too. However, some studies have found increased NBR’s magnitude in AD patients compared to HE. These variations might be due to differences in the stages of disease among participants, as well as other factors like APOE or higher levels of Aβ or tau. Different technical methods for generating NBR and PBR patterns might also contribute to these conflicting results.\nIn this project, we included 161 studies where alterations in NBR were reported in task-evoked fMRI studies due to normal aging, Aβ/tau deposition, MCI, and AD, resulting in, in total, 11,211 participants. Our goal was to highlight the importance of utilizing the NBR in the functional imaging studies of aging and neurodegeneration and advocate for its translation into medicine. For instance, young patients (< 30 years) with autosomal dominant AD (E280A presenilin-1 mutation carriers) have shown a significant decrease in the magnitude of NBR from the DMN regions during the asymptomatic stage of the disease before any traces of Aβ and tau accumulation [\nThis review on task-evoked fMRI studies focuses on changes in the NBR patterns and expression, which are often overlooked in existing reviews. To our knowledge, this is the first article to systematically review the literature on NBR patterns in AD, MCI, AD pathology, and aging. As shown by the results of previous systematic reviews focused on changes in activation patterns, there may be some degree of deactivation failure in the continuum from normal aging to MCI and AD, which is most evident in DMN. The failure of DMN deactivation in HE is consistently reported [\nIt is worth noting that the severity of AD impacts DMN. As we have shown here, DMN's NBR is disturbed in MCI [\nDMN disruption is evident across the AD continuum and its various phenotypes, in different aspects of neurodegeneration [\nIn this paper, we have discussed changes in NBR in the AD continuum and aging in detail. However, it is worth noting that although alterations in NBR are not limited to these processes, there are scarce reports of this observation in other neurodegenerative diseases as well. For instance, patients with Lewy body dementia (DLB) showed heightened DMN deactivation compared to those with AD in one study [\nPBR and NBR are observed in the same or sometimes separate regions when performing specific tasks [\nThis figure shows the origins of negative and positive BOLD responses and the underlying changes in hemodynamic response.\nNeurovascular coupling is a highly regulated and well-maintained physiological phenomenon that couples task-evoked neuronal activity and astrocyte glial cells with increased cerebral blood flow and oxygenation caused by changes in vascular smooth muscle [\nAn often-neglected component of BOLD response is neurometabolic coupling [\nFailure in DMN’s NBR may be due to dysfunction in cognitive resource allocations during memory tasks [\nThe cascading network failure hypothesis proposes that when the posterior DMN fails and begins shifting the processing burden to other brain hub regions, it leads to aberrant amyloidosis and tauopathy [\nMany factors should be considered as the source of heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory reports in the literature. There is a large variety of reporting styles in tb-fMRI studies [\nSpecifically, different studies performed on MCI and AD patients may employ different inclusion criteria, the level of clinical severity, and methods for imaging acquisition and analysis [\nIn general, the prevalence of brain Aβ positivity among cognitively unimpaired participants aged 50 to 90 can range from 10 to 44% in a meta-analysis [\nGiven the high prevalence of amyloid and tau in the brain of cognitively unimpaired participants and considering that almost all the aging studies reviewed here, did not control for AD pathology, it is challenging to distinguish whether the observed aging effects are due to AD pathology, in respect to its effects on NBR, discussed earlier, or they are pure aging consequences. This may be the source of discrepancy in studies reviewed earlier and heavily emphasizes the importance of controlling for AD pathology in all future task fMRI studies on aging.\nIn addition to the confounding effects of AD pathology, another important factor should be considered. It is very challenging for patients with AD to perform cognitive tasks, and AD patients who cannot perform the tasks as normally expected will not show reliable task-related deactivation/activation patterns [\nFurthermore, as we explained in detail throughout the methods, different studies use different cognitive tasks with varying difficulty levels. As pointed out in the results, different difficulty levels led to different deactivation/activation patterns in different tasks, like N-back. Also, besides some common functional components, different tasks cause diverse deactivation/activation patterns [\nIt is worth noting that a source of heterogeneity in deactivation data might result from the method employed for analyzing fMRI data. Some studies use block design, some use event-related, and some employ a mixed-design method. This itself can be a source of heterogeneity [\nAlso, different studies use different methodologies for calculating the BOLD signal, which can potentially affect results. They might use different programs or different levels of analysis. Although NBR and PBR are calculated in an identical process, there are two important reasons why they are often disregarded. NBR is generally a weaker response than PBR, and it can be underestimated if the same thresholds are used, and it sometimes might even get masked out. Therefore, a slightly lower threshold is needed to add more negativity [\nAnother important technical consideration is deciding whether to contrast task activity against resting condition, fixation control condition, or lower workload. This is very important; each contrast is unique and has a different BOLD measurement. When researchers analyze tb-fMRI data, they should be cautious about interpreting BOLD signal contrasts, particularly in differentiating between activation and deactivation. Misinterpretation can occur if the contrasts are not carefully chosen, leading to potential errors in understanding the brain's activity and a great source of heterogeneity in this field.\nOne cannot find the true directionality of the BOLD signal if the correct baseline is not used in the study [\nTherefore, researchers should understand the BOLD response as an indirect measurement of neuronal activity and interpret the results in the context of positive or negative BOLD responses [\nAnother source of confusion is the terminology used in the literature. Terms such as \"negative activation,\" \"reduced activation,\" and \"decreased activation\" are just a few examples of many different terms used to explain NBR. It is best if the author simply states \"activation\" or \"deactivation,\" and explains whether it is an increase or decrease happening in the magnitude of the negative or positive BOLD response, addressing both directions of change without leaving any ambiguity.\nRegardless of the underlying cause, reduced NBR’s magnitude is an important finding and can prove to be a reliable biomarker for the timely diagnosis of dementia and a predictive biomarker for the likelihood, degree, and rate of decline. Also, NBR can be used as an important factor in follow-up clinical trials of therapeutic drugs discovery in AD [\n\nAdditional file 1", "content_for_embedding": "This review article explains the background and mechanisms of NBR and BOLD. The knowledge about NBR and its medical translation is limited. This study highlights the importance of the NBR in aging and AD research, considering evidence regarding its impairment before irreversible neurodegeneration when therapy may still be useful. In summary, NBR’s pattern is impaired in aging adults, and it is even more disturbed in pathological aging, including MCI, AD, and early tau and amyloid deposition. We highlight the importance of NBR in the functional imaging studies of aging and neurodegeneration, and advocate for translating it into medicine. We also discuss the difficulties, heterogeneities, and challenges found in this field in our review.\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized our understanding of brain neurophysiology, hemodynamics, and function [\nThe temporal dynamic of the PBR’s hemodynamic response function (HRF) is now fully characterized. It has been used for many years [\nThe regions where negative BOLD responses (NBR) are often detected. (1) Default mode network. The articles discussed here mainly focus on this type of NBR; (2) Areas in the vicinity of the PBR. This usually includes the sensory/motor cortices; (3) The ipsilateral hemisphere. These regions usually show NBR during unilateral sensory/motor stimulation; 4) Ventricles.\nThe DMN was described in 2001 as an organized, baseline functioning network of the brain that is active during rest and during internally directed thoughts, whose activity decreases when attention shifts to external stimuli [\nSignals from DMN regions have been shown to fluctuate at low frequencies but coherently in the absence of external stimulation. This fMRI characteristic is often called functional connectivity (FC) [\nThe rationale for performing this review is the fact that although the last three decades saw a massive expansion of fMRI-based research in the wide range of psychiatric and neurologic disorders [\nSince AD pathologies tend to start accumulating decades before symptoms occur, they may have already taken over the brain prior to symptom onset. Therefore, diagnosis and intervention at earlier stages of the disease are crucial. Any effective pharmacological treatment option for AD requires detecting this disease before devastating neuronal loss and clinically evident symptoms [\ncompares the mean NBR/PBR pattern between young and healthy elderly groups during synonym tb-fMRI. These patterns are shown in voxel-wise surface plots of healthy young (Left panel) and healthy elderly (right Panel). Deactivation decreased, and activations increased throughout aging\nConvincing evidence exists regarding deactivation and activation failure in AD and MCI participants [\nOther rationales for writing this review is our limited knowledge about the NBR signal in general, the lack of evidence evaluating NBR in clinical settings, and limited clinical applications for fMRI. There are many challenges and heterogeneous data in this field. One major obstacle is that existing studies use different cognitive tasks, inclusion criteria, and terminology in reporting deactivation or NBR. Using different terms such as “negative activation,” “reduced activation,” and “decreased activation” is another big problem in this field. Also, many researchers mask NBR, and we believe this only underscores the importance of a holistic understanding of brain functions.\nThis review evaluates clinical research using NBR as an imaging biomarker to evaluate normal cognitive decline (normal aging), MCI, and AD.\nThis study adheres to the latest edition of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [\nThe authors comprehensively searched the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases. Finally, they updated the database search on 6/11/2024, and the snowballing and additional searches on the same day, along with forward and backward citation tracking on Scopus for all the studies published up to 6/11/2024.\nGiven the aim of this review, we first reviewed \"deactivation\" and \"negative bold response\" findings in fMRI studies on MCI, AD, and normal cognitive decline in the literature. Following this research, we decided that \"negative signal change,\" \"negative activation,\" \"deactivation,\" and \"negative bold response\" are used interchangeably. We also found that many articles reported these findings in the manuscript but did not mention them in the abstract or keywords. Alternatively, some researchers reported these negative responses in captions of figures and tables, and they were not mentioned in the main manuscript.\nSince many studies did not mention \"deactivation\" or \"negative BOLD response\" as their keywords or in their abstracts, we selected the following search term to enhance further yield for this systematic review. We used 3 different search term groups.\nOur first search terms were (\"mild cognitive impairment\" OR \"Alzheimer's disease\") AND \"fMRI\" AND \"task\" AND “BOLD.” Our second search terms were \"aging\" AND \"fMRI\" AND \"task\" AND \"BOLD.\" Our third and final search terms were (\"tau\" OR \"amyloid\") AND \"fMRI\" AND \"task.\" We did not include \"BOLD\" in the third search term because it would result in a minimal number of studies, potentially excluding many related studies. We performed this search strategy in the PubMed database with no limits, which resulted in articles from 1999 to 2024.\nWe performed the following search strategies for the first, second, and third search terms using the Embase database, respectively, limiting the results to article types:\n('Mild cognitive impairment':ti,ab,kw OR'Alzheimer’s disease':ti,ab,kw) AND fmri:ti,ab,kw AND task:ti,ab,kw AND bold:ti,ab,kw AND'article'/it\nAging:ti,ab,kw AND fmri:ti,ab,kw AND bold:ti,ab,kw AND task:ti,ab,kw AND'article'/it\n(Tau:ti,ab,kw OR amyloid:ti,ab,kw) AND fmri:ti,ab,kw AND task:ti,ab,kw AND'article'/it\nWe also performed the following search strategies using Scopus database:\nTITLE-ABS-KEY (\"mild cognitive impairment\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (\"alzheimer's disease\") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (task) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (fmri) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (bold) AND LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE,\"ar\")\nTITLE-ABS-KEY (aging) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (fmri) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (task) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (bold) AND LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE,\"ar\")\nTITLE-ABS-KEY (tau) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (amyloid) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (task) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (fmri) AND LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE,\"ar\")\nWe did not include \"deactivation\" or \"negative BOLD response\" in our search to avoid losing articles that did not report these findings in their abstracts or keywords.\nDue to time constraints, the authors employed a single screening method. Single abstract screening misses up to 13% of relevant articles [\nOur first author reviewed the titles and abstracts of all the records and then screened the titles and abstracts of all the articles retrieved. Our last author checked a random sample of screened records. In the case of disagreement, the discussion reached a consensus on which articles to screen for full text.\nWe designed a data extraction form, which 2 review authors used to extract data from eligible studies. The extracted data were compared, with any discrepancies being resolved through discussion.\nEligible outcomes were broadly categorized as follows:\nReports of any measure of deactivation, negative activation, or NBR, or the lack of these signals normally seen in healthy controls, were eligible for inclusion. The tests or diagnostic criteria used in each paper should have had evidence of validity and reliability for assessing MCI, AD, aging, and increased tau or Aβ. Results could be reported as an overall increase, decrease, or constant level of NBR.\nWhere multiple outcomes were reported, we selected one outcome for inclusion in analyses and for reporting the main outcomes, choosing the result that provided the most complete information for analysis. Where multiple results remained, we listed all available outcomes (without results) based on relevance to the review question and the validity and reliability of the measures used.\nWe collected data on:\nThe report: author, year, and source of publication.\nThe study: sample characteristics, social demography, and definition and criteria used for diagnosis.\nThe participants: case group (AD, MCI, HE, or participants with increased tau or Aβ,) control group (HE or healthy young participants (HY)), social situation, time elapsed since diagnosis, history of psychiatric or other neurologic illness, current neurological status, current treatment mental impairment, and history of coronary artery disease or risk factors.\nThe research design and features: sampling mechanism, deactivation/activation patterns, length of follow-up if applicable, type of the utilized task, and type of PET imaging contrast.\nGiven the complexities of different tasks and methods being investigated, we attempted to categorize the results among different participants. We created categories of results based on the below dimensions:\nNBR patterns in AD patients\nNBR patterns in MCI patients\nNBR patterns in aging\nTau or Aβ deposition and NBR\nSome studies showed contradictory results (e.g., an increase in the magnitude of NBR in DMN in Aging). We did not exclude those articles; we will describe them in greater detail in the results and discussion sections regarding the task being used.\nStudies were classified based on whether they showed a reduction in the magnitude of NBR, no effect, or an increase in the magnitude of NBR during task performance. Considering the heterogeneity of data and the different nature of tasks and contrasts (Hard vs. Easy or Task vs. Resting-State) being used and various characteristics of each group (eg, age, mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)), conducting a meta-analysis was not possible. The statistical approach used, therefore, was to consider the significance levels (P values) before entering studies. The rationale for this choice is that all the articles reported the same broad question, ie, ‘What is the deactivation/activation pattern during this task in each group?'. Using this approach, the null hypothesis tested is that task performance has no significant effect on NBR in any of the considered articles. If the null hypothesis is rejected, we can conclude that there is a non-null effect in at least one study. If the results are interpreted with sufficient precaution, this approach can combine results from very dissimilar trials with differing outcomes and statistical tests.\nWe performed exploratory analyses to determine whether different characteristics varied the effects of the interventions. The authors evaluated the P values before including the articles. Researchers used different tasks. We examined whether this other kind of task modified, on average, the effect of the interventions.\nWe did not use any tools or systematic approaches to summarize each intervention strategy's findings. However, the authors independently assessed the certainty of evidence to conclude the certainty of the evidence. We resolved disagreements on certainty by discussion.\nThe identified articles employed numerous cognitive, sensory, and motor tasks. While an exhaustive description of these tasks is beyond the scope of this study, we briefly describe some of the most used tasks within 9 different categories in supplementary material 1. However, readers are encouraged to consult the original studies for further details.\nOur first search criterion returned 249 records in the databases. After duplicate removals, we screened 159 records and reviewed 86 full-text manuscripts. Finally, 9 articles met our inclusion criteria. Next, our forward and backward search in documents that cited any of the initially identified studies, and the references of the initially identified studies, resulted in 55 studies, making the total included manuscripts 64. (A flowchart for this search is shown in Fig.\nPRISMA flow diagram regarding the third search strategy\nWe found 642 records in the databases searching for our second criterion. After duplicate removals, we screened 319 records and reviewed 197 full-text manuscripts. Finally, 42 articles met our inclusion criteria.

Our search resulted in 3 more articles, making the final identified 17 articles (as shown in Fig.\nPRISMA flow diagram regarding the second search strategy\nWe did not exclude any studies that met the inclusion criteria from our review.\nThe most observed finding in these studies is the decrease in the magnitude of NBR through aging. It is mainly seen within various DMN regions. Also, there might be an increased magnitude of activation instead of the expected NBR across different brain regions. These are reported using a variety of tasks. Fifty-eight articles confirmed suppression in the NBR of some DMN regions. This suppression is not necessarily limited to DMN regions and may extend to regions outside the DMN. Some of the tasks these studies use include, but are not limited to, semantic classification, N-back, and face-name pair tasks [\nThese findings are not limited to DMN areas, as they have also been observed in other brain regions in 8 studies. These regions include the left auditory cortex during a face encoding task, [\nTwelve studies have explored the association between task difficulty and the NBR change rate. Eight studies reported changes in DMN, using various tasks, including but not limited to N-back tasks, distance-judgement tasks, and verb-generation tasks. These studies showed that HE exhibits a lower rate of change in the DMN’s NBR compared to HY. Furthermore, this disturbance was not limited to classical DMN regions [\nAdditionally, many studies have evaluated the relationship between the magnitude of NBR and performance in elderly populations. Reduced NBR magnitude in HE corresponds to worse performance in 8 articles, mainly using N-back, face-name pair, and distance judgment tasks [\nWhile most studies have used cognitive tasks to explore deactivation/activation patterns through aging, some studies employed motor tasks to that end. Many studies have demonstrated the reduced magnitude of NBR and even changing to PBR with aging in various brain regions, including the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1), [\nWhile we mostly discussed the reduction in the magnitude of DMN’s NBR in this review paper, there are reports of increased magnitude of NBR in HE participants, which are not necessarily in the same regions. Therefore, in this paragraph, we discuss the results of those studies and the possible reasons behind these contradictory findings. Aging might be associated with increased and decreased NBR within different regions, as it was associated with increased magnitude of right superior parietal gyrus NBR during N-back. However, HE did not deactivate the middle frontal gyrus, but HY did [\nSome articles found no age-related differences in NBR using a multi-factorial memory task [\nMost studies suggest a failure to deactivate the DMN as people age, which can manifest as either reduced or absent NBR magnitude. Instead of the usual NBR seen in HY, this failure might even present as activation in HE. This NBR’s failure in the DMN is generally associated with poorer task performance, especially during more challenging tasks. Failure is not always confined to the DMN and can affect other brain areas. However, some studies have observed an increased NBR magnitude in HE compared to HY. These differences might be due to disease stage variations among participants, factors like apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, or higher levels of Aβ or tau. Different technical methods for generating activation/deactivation patterns could also contribute to these conflicting results.\nThe most common finding in these studies is the reduced magnitude of the NBR from DMN found in association with higher and earlier Aβ burden. Nine studies using various tasks, including face-name pairs, executive contextual, and gist tasks, showed that Aβ deposition is associated with either a decrease in the magnitude of the NBR mainly from some DMN regions, or increased brain activity in regions, including some of the DMN regions that usually deactivated across HY and Aβ negative HE participants [\nThis increased magnitude of brain activity was associated with poorer performance [\nAlso, one study reported no effect of Aβ deposition in aging on the DMN’s NBR during a Visual Scene Recognition task. Their cut-off was PIB DVR of 1.08 [\nThe failure of deactivation in the DMN is shown to be related to the progression of tau pathology. Aberrant neural activity may be a crucial process driving remote Aβ and tau interactions. AD pathologies have been shown to alter interactions between the DMN and the medial temporal lobe (MTL), changing them from suppression of neural activity to increased activation. With increasing Aβ levels, the DMN becomes hyperexcitable, leading to hyperexcitability in the MTL and subsequent tau accumulation in EC [\nThere is also evidence regarding the decreasing magnitude of DMN’s NBR with AD-related CSF pathology in two studies. During a delayed match to sample task and a scene encoding task, a lower magnitude of NBR in DMN was linked with higher AD CSF pathology [\nThere is convincing evidence regarding the impacts of AD pathology and the reduced magnitude of NBR or the increased magnitude of PBR on each other. There is compelling data about increasing Aβ levels in CSF or higher burden in PET causing these changes in BOLD response, especially in DMN regions. This increased magnitude of activation or reduced magnitude of NBR may eventually result in increased tau deposition, which in turn may cause increments in activation itself. Overall, like AD, MCI, and HE, reduced NBR magnitude is mainly shown to be associated with poorer task performance.\nIn these studies, decreased magnitude of the NBR through aging is the most common finding. Seventeen studies investigating the change in the fMRI signal from the DMN during tasks such as the N-back, attention network test, and face encoding consistently reported a reduction in the magnitude of the NBR in MCI patients or even reported PBR in the DMN, where usually NBR is observed in healthy controls [\nA few studies reported the relationship between task difficulty and the change in the magnitude of the NBR from the DMN. Using the verbal N-back task, HE deactivated the amygdala more significantly with a higher task load, whereas MCI patients activated the amygdala under both low and high-load conditions [\nAlthough most studies reviewed here generally reported reduced magnitude of NBR, some studies showed an increase in the magnitude of the NBR in the DMN of the MCI patients, conversely. In this paragraph, we discuss this phenomenon. For instance, semantic and phonemic tasks increased NBR’s magnitude in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, and IPL [\nFinally, a few studies reported no change in the NBR from the DMN of the MCI patients or showed mixed results. Studies using face-name pair tasks and visual item memory tasks found no significant difference in NBR between HE and MCI, probably due to patients being in the early stages of MCI or having stable MCI [\nAltogether, it appears that most studies have shown a deactivation failure within the DMN in MCI participants compared to HE. This failure manifests itself consistently as a reduced NBR magnitude or absent deactivation. Also, deactivation failure of DMN may even appear as PBR instead of the normally expected NBR observed in HE. This deactivation failure in DMN is mainly correlated with poorer performance during tasks or more impairment, evident in scales such as MDRS. In addition, deactivation failure of the DMN may become more apparent when using more challenging tasks than easier ones. Interestingly, deactivation failure is not always confined to classical DMN and may involve other areas as well. However, some studies have reported increased NBR magnitude in MCI patients compared to HE. The reason behind these findings may be differences in stages of disease, and other confounding factors like APOE or higher levels of Aβ or tau in these groups. Other possible reasons are different technical methods for generating deactivation/activation patterns.\nThe most common finding in these studies was the reduced magnitude of the NBR in the DMN in AD patients. Fourteen studies using various tasks, including semantic classification, face-encoding, and face-name pairs tasks, reported a reduction in the magnitude of some DMN regions’ NBR or an increased magnitude of the PBR instead of the NBR seen in HE from the DMN of AD patients compared with HE or HY [\nA few studies, like those involving MCI patients, analyzed how increasing task difficulty changes the magnitude of the DMN’s NBR. AD patients continued to activate the DMN during the attention network test even as the difficulty increased, unlike HE, who showed NBR [\nIn contrast to the previous results, some studies have observed a higher NBR magnitude in AD patients. These studies did not agree with the generally decreased deactivation reported in patients. This conflict might be because none of these studies have reported correction for tau or Aβ. Also, this could be due to the different cognition statuses and genetics of participants, or their gender. Namely, using the verbal fluency task, the AD group showed more NBR magnitude compared to HE in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, and IPL [\nEight articles compared AD and MCI patients during the task fMRI, and they reported a reduced NBR magnitude or increased PBR magnitude in some DMN areas of AD patients compared to MCI patients. However, when compared to HY or HE, both patient groups exhibited a reduced magnitude of NBR. These studies employed various tasks, such as face-name pairs, olfactory, and word list tasks [\nUnlike the studies reporting a linear pattern in the AD continuum, studies report an inverted U-shaped or quadratic pattern of deactivation/activation in the continuum of AD pathology. This pattern starts as NBR in HE, which becomes a higher magnitude of PBR or reduced NBR magnitude in early MCI, and finally changes to a lesser PBR magnitude or higher NBR magnitude in participants with progressed disease. During a visual associative memory encoding task, patients with subjective cognitive decline plus (SCD+) (who had smaller hippocampal volumes and/or APOE ε4 allele) exhibited a higher magnitude of activation in the left superior parietal lobule, right precuneus, and bilateral middle temporal lobes. In contrast, a lesser magnitude of PBR or NBR was observed in MCI patients and HE, forming an inverted U-shaped model [\nUsing face-name pairs, less impaired MCI participants showed an increased magnitude of PBR in the hippocampus compared to the NBR observed in HE. Conversely, more impaired MCI participants demonstrated a reduced magnitude of PBR, akin to the levels observed in the mild AD participants. Additionally, in patients with MCI and AD, the deactivation failure in these regions was associated with increased PBR in a neocortical attentional network [\nOverall, it seems that most studies have indicated a failure to deactivate some of the DMN regions in individuals with AD compared to HE. This failure typically appears as either reduced or absent NBR. This failure might even present as activation instead of the usual NBR seen in healthy individuals. The deactivation failure in the DMN is generally linked to poorer task performance or more significant cognitive impairment. Moreover, this failure tends to be more pronounced during more challenging tasks. Like MCI patients, failure is not always restricted to the DMN and can affect other areas too. However, some studies have found increased NBR’s magnitude in AD patients compared to HE. These variations might be due to differences in the stages of disease among participants, as well as other factors like APOE or higher levels of Aβ or tau. Different technical methods for generating NBR and PBR patterns might also contribute to these conflicting results.\nIn this project, we included 161 studies where alterations in NBR were reported in task-evoked fMRI studies due to normal aging, Aβ/tau deposition, MCI, and AD, resulting in, in total, 11,211 participants. Our goal was to highlight the importance of utilizing the NBR in the functional imaging studies of aging and neurodegeneration and advocate for its translation into medicine. For instance, young patients (< 30 years) with autosomal dominant AD (E280A presenilin-1 mutation carriers) have shown a significant decrease in the magnitude of NBR from the DMN regions during the asymptomatic stage of the disease before any traces of Aβ and tau accumulation [\nThis review on task-evoked fMRI studies focuses on changes in the NBR patterns and expression, which are often overlooked in existing reviews. To our knowledge, this is the first article to systematically review the literature on NBR patterns in AD, MCI, AD pathology, and aging. As shown by the results of previous systematic reviews focused on changes in activation patterns, there may be some degree of deactivation failure in the continuum from normal aging to MCI and AD, which is most evident in DMN. The failure of DMN deactivation in HE is consistently reported [\nIt is worth noting that the severity of AD impacts DMN. As we have shown here, DMN's NBR is disturbed in MCI [\nDMN disruption is evident across the AD continuum and its various phenotypes, in different aspects of neurodegeneration [\nIn this paper, we have discussed changes in NBR in the AD continuum and aging in detail. However, it is worth noting that although alterations in NBR are not limited to these processes, there are scarce reports of this observation in other neurodegenerative diseases as well. For instance, patients with Lewy body dementia (DLB) showed heightened DMN deactivation compared to those with AD in one study [\nPBR and NBR are observed in the same or sometimes separate regions when performing specific tasks [\nThis figure shows the origins of negative and positive BOLD responses and the underlying changes in hemodynamic response.\nNeurovascular coupling is a highly regulated and well-maintained physiological phenomenon that couples task-evoked neuronal activity and astrocyte glial cells with increased cerebral blood flow and oxygenation caused by changes in vascular smooth muscle [\nAn often-neglected component of BOLD response is neurometabolic coupling [\nFailure in DMN’s NBR may be due to dysfunction in cognitive resource allocations during memory tasks [\nThe cascading network failure hypothesis proposes that when the posterior DMN fails and begins shifting the processing burden to other brain hub regions, it leads to aberrant amyloidosis and tauopathy [\nMany factors should be considered as the source of heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory reports in the literature. There is a large variety of reporting styles in tb-fMRI studies [\nSpecifically, different studies performed on MCI and AD patients may employ different inclusion criteria, the level of clinical severity, and methods for imaging acquisition and analysis [\nIn general, the prevalence of brain Aβ positivity among cognitively unimpaired participants aged 50 to 90 can range from 10 to 44% in a meta-analysis [\nGiven the high prevalence of amyloid and tau in the brain of cognitively unimpaired participants and considering that almost all the aging studies reviewed here, did not control for AD pathology, it is challenging to distinguish whether the observed aging effects are due to AD pathology, in respect to its effects on NBR, discussed earlier, or they are pure aging consequences. This may be the source of discrepancy in studies reviewed earlier and heavily emphasizes the importance of controlling for AD pathology in all future task fMRI studies on aging.\nIn addition to the confounding effects of AD pathology, another important factor should be considered. It is very challenging for patients with AD to perform cognitive tasks, and AD patients who cannot perform the tasks as normally expected will not show reliable task-related deactivation/activation patterns [\nFurthermore, as we explained in detail throughout the methods, different studies use different cognitive tasks with varying difficulty levels. As pointed out in the results, different difficulty levels led to different deactivation/activation patterns in different tasks, like N-back. Also, besides some common functional components, different tasks cause diverse deactivation/activation patterns [\nIt is worth noting that a source of heterogeneity in deactivation data might result from the method employed for analyzing fMRI data. Some studies use block design, some use event-related, and some employ a mixed-design method. This itself can be a source of heterogeneity [\nAlso, different studies use different methodologies for calculating the BOLD signal, which can potentially affect results. They might use different programs or different levels of analysis. Although NBR and PBR are calculated in an identical process, there are two important reasons why they are often disregarded. NBR is generally a weaker response than PBR, and it can be underestimated if the same thresholds are used, and it sometimes might even get masked out. Therefore, a slightly lower threshold is needed to add more negativity [\nAnother important technical consideration is deciding whether to contrast task activity against resting condition, fixation control condition, or lower workload. This is very important; each contrast is unique and has a different BOLD measurement. When researchers analyze tb-fMRI data, they should be cautious about interpreting BOLD signal contrasts, particularly in differentiating between activation and deactivation. Misinterpretation can occur if the contrasts are not carefully chosen, leading to potential errors in understanding the brain's activity and a great source of heterogeneity in this field.\nOne cannot find the true directionality of the BOLD signal if the correct baseline is not used in the study [\nTherefore, researchers should understand the BOLD response as an indirect measurement of neuronal activity and interpret the results in the context of positive or negative BOLD responses [\nAnother source of confusion is the terminology used in the literature. Terms such as \"negative activation,\" \"reduced activation,\" and \"decreased activation\" are just a few examples of many different terms used to explain NBR. It is best if the author simply states \"activation\" or \"deactivation,\" and explains whether it is an increase or decrease happening in the magnitude of the negative or positive BOLD response, addressing both directions of change without leaving any ambiguity.\nRegardless of the underlying cause, reduced NBR’s magnitude is an important finding and can prove to be a reliable biomarker for the timely diagnosis of dementia and a predictive biomarker for the likelihood, degree, and rate of decline. Also, NBR can be used as an important factor in follow-up clinical trials of therapeutic drugs discovery in AD [\n\nAdditional file 1", "topic": "Alzheimer_Disease"}

Microglia and astrocytes frequently cluster around these plaques, playing a crucial role in Aβ processing and plaque dynamics [\nRecent omics studies have identified genes and gene modules associated with Aβ plaques at both bulk and single-cell/nucleus levels [\nHere, we apply ST and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to 78 postmortem human brain sections from 21 individuals to obtain spatially resolved transcriptomic profiles alongside pathology measurements. With this large and unique dataset, we aim to decipher the interactions between Aβ plaques and glial cells by addressing two key questions: (1) What transcriptomic responses are associated with Aβ plaques in human brains? (2) How do plaque-associated glia cells influence these responses? By leveraging Aβ, GFAP, and IBA1 intensity measurements, we stratify ST spots into major types of plaque-glia niches, uncovering distinct differences in gene expression, cellular composition, and intercellular communication. We further validate the apoptotic and neuronal effects of Aβ and glial activation using IHC in postmortem brain sections. Our findings reveal exacerbated synaptic and neuronal loss in low-Aβ or high-glia areas, indicating the diverse roles of glial cell states in shaping the local immune response in AD.\nThe human brain tissues were obtained through the ROSMAP (Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project) cohort studies at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL. Written informed consent was given by the donors for brain autopsy and for the use of material and clinical data for research purposes, in compliance with national ethical guidelines. Clinicopathological information of the donor, including postmortem time, age, and sex, is recorded (Supplementary Table 1). Neuropathological diagnosis of the Aβ deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and other pathologies is provided (Supplementary Table 1). We selected 13 individuals clinically diagnosed as AD with high pathology and 8 controls with no cognitive impairment (NCI) and no or very little pathology. All individuals are female and matched for age. We chose all female individuals because there were insufficient males in the ROSMAP cohort matching our selection criteria (e.g. RIN > 5, age-matched, minimal freezing artifacts in frozen DLPFC). Frozen brain blocks of the right-hemisphere DLPFC from 21 individuals were cut (~ 1 cm\nFrozen brain blocks were embedded in OCT and cryosectioned coronally to a thickness of 10 μm using a Leica CM1950 cryostat set at −17C. Sectioning was done in sets of three (middle section for ST and two adjacent sections for IF), with 10–50 μm between each set. Sections were attached to Visium slides and stored at −80C in a slide mailer for up to one week before proceeding with spatial transcriptomics. ST-adjacent sections were attached to pre-labeled Leica superfrost plus slides and stored at −80C in slide mailers for up to two weeks before proceeding with immunohistochemistry.\nSpatial Transcriptomics was performed according to the Visium Spatial Gene Expression User Guide (10X Genomics;\nWe first attempted to perform IHC staining on the ST section, following 10X Genomics recommendations. However, due to the modified protocol required to preserve RNA integrity (i.e., methanol instead of PFA fixation, no antigen retrieval, shorter blocking, and antibody incubations), we were unable to obtain adequate staining quality. We decided instead to perform IHC on two ST-adjacent sections. Cryosectioned tissue on Leica super-frost slides was transferred from −80C to the lab on dry ice and quickly thawed for 1 min on a heat block at 37 C, then immediately transferred to a slide-mailer filled with PFA pre-equilibrated to 4 C and fixed at 4 C for 20 min. Slides were washed twice with DPBS before performing antigen retrieval for 10 min @ 95 C in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Following antigen retrieval, slides were washed three times with DPBS, a hydrophobic barrier was drawn surrounding the tissue (two sections per slide), and then sections were blocked for 1 h at RT in blocking buffer (DPBS containing 5% normal goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, and Human TruStain FcX (Fc blocker)). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies to detect Aβ (4G8), GFAP, and IBA1 (diluted in blocking buffer). The next day, the primary antibody solution was removed, and sections were washed three times with DPBS (5 min per wash). Sections were then incubated for 1.5 h at RT in the dark with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 for Aβ, Alexa Fluor 790 for GFAP, and Alexa Fluor 594 for IBA1) diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer. The secondary antibody solution was removed, and sections were washed four times with DPBS (5 min per wash), then incubated with DAPI to stain nuclei and Trueblack (according to the manufacturer’s instructions) to quench tissue autofluorescence. Slides were coverslipped and imaged on the ThermoFisher CellInsight CX7 LZR High Content Analysis Platform (HCA; 100 16-bit images per section).\nH&E images were acquired from ST sections with an Eclipse Ti2-E microscope (Nikon) at 20 × magnification in 9 × 9 tile tiff files with 10% overlap and were stitched into a single image per section with Adobe Photoshop (23.4.2 release). We note that some patches not covered by tissue could not be stitched, but tissue-covered areas were unaffected. To verify this, we confirmed alignment of spot coordinates to the H&E image. Fluorescent Aβ, GFAP, IBA1, and DAPI images were acquired from the two adjacent sections with the ThermoFisher HCA at 20 × magnification in 10 × 10 tile 16-bit tiff files. Background and shading correction were performed with the ImageJ plugin BaSiC [\nDue to the non-uniform intensity background across tiles and bright areas arising from artifacts such as tissue wrinkles and tears, we applied standard image processing techniques for further background correction and artifact removal. Using a structural element with a size well above that of amyloid plaques, microglia, and astrocytes, for each IF image, we performed grayscale opening and closing to extract large bright artifacts and local background inhomogeneity, which we regressed out from the image. With the artifact-corrected IHC images, we quantified the amount of amyloid, microglia, and astrocytes by averaging the intensity of pixels within each spot of the ST sections. We excluded spots near tissue borders overlapping with bright artifacts from our analysis.\nFFPE cortical sections were pre-heated for 60 min at 60 C in a dry oven and then rehydrated using a series of xylene and ethanol dilutions before rehydrating in DI water. Sections were then used for performing antigen retrieval for 20 min in boiling 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Following antigen retrieval, sections were washed with DPBS, incubated in 0.02N HCl for 20 min for peroxide blocking, washed with DPBS, and blocked for 1 h at RT in TNB blocking buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.5% Akoya blocking reagent; prepared as per manufacturer's instructions). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies diluted in the TNB blocking buffer to detect combinations of Aβ (4G8; 1:1000), GFAP (1:1500), IBA1 (1:200), cleaved Caspase-3 (1:250), NeuN (1:100), SYP (1:500) and/or CD68 (1:100). The following day, primary antibody solution was removed from sections, washed three times with TNT wash buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) (5 min per wash) and incubated for 1 h at RT in the dark with species-appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 568, Alexa Fluor 647, Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 790) diluted 1:1000 in DPBS. For cleaved Caspase-3 staining, the antibody was detected with a Mouse IgM-HRP secondary, incubated for 1 h at RT, followed by a 5 min incubation with tyramide Cy5. After secondary antibody incubation, sections were washed three times with TNT wash buffer (5 min per wash), then incubated with Trueblack for 1 min to quench tissue autofluorescence. Slides were washed two times with DPBS (5 min per wash), incubated with Hoechst 34580 (1:2000 in DPBS) for staining nuclei, mounted using Prolong antifade mountant and coverslipped. Slides were dried overnight at RT and imaged on the ThermoFisher HCA (200–300 16-bit images per section).\nIHC stained slides were imaged on the ThermoFisher HCA at 20x. 24 fields per section were selected to profile the thickness of the cortex from the meninges to the white matter for each subject. Images were processed using the compartmental analysis module in the HCA software. After background correction, 4G8 staining was used to identify plaque-like objects with the following parameters: objectarea > 20 μm, smoothing = 2. The 4G8-based objects were used as a mask to generate a region of interest (ROI) for the GFAP and IBA1 channels that encompassed both the object area and an extension from the edge of each object up to 25 μm without overlap. Calculated metrics, including the average ROI intensity for each channel, object size, and object shape, and counts were exported from the software. The data was filtered for an average 4G8 intensity > 2000. To adjust for technical differences in staining intensities between slides, the intensity data was scaled and centered for each case, and these resulting z-scores were used for subsequent plots. To classify plaques, an investigator blinded to the HCA measurements manually scored all 4G8-based objects as diffuse, compact, or dense core plaques (or as a staining artifact or vessel Aβ, both of which were excluded) yielding a final sample size of n = 722 plaques from n = 9 cases. For target intensity measurements, either the compartmental or colocalization analysis modules of the CellInsight system were used to define secondary objects and extract the average intensity and counts within each ROI. The top 25% of 4G8-based objects based on the scaled average 4G8 intensity was defined as high Aβ and the lower 75% as low Aβ. Objects with an ROI scoring in the top 25% for either scaled GFAP or scaled IBA1 average intensities were defined as glia-high and the remaining objects as glia-low. For NeuN (n = 10)/SYP(n = 9) (Fig.\nSequencing data were pre-processed with Space Ranger pipeline (10 × Genomics), which mapped the barcodes against the human genome (Gencode 27), generated FASTQ files, and generated a count matrix for each section. The individual files were then merged in a Seurat object (Seurat v4.2.0) and were processed in R. We calculated per-spot quality metrics and spots with low-measured genes (< 500) were removed. The Seurat::SCTransform function was used to normalize and scale the UMI counts based on regularized negative binomial regression. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the top 3000 variable genes. Using the top 50 PCs (Supplementary Fig.\nBenchmarking of data integration methods was performed using the\nDownsampling to 16 sections was performed using Seurat::Subset on the full dataset. Seurat pipeline was run as described above, resulting in 10 clusters that were manually annotated based on their similarity to those generated from the full dataset.

Upon inspection of the qPlot (Supplementary Fig.\nWe performed co-expression network analysis using all spots and sections of the ST data. We created a pseudo-bulk gene expression matrix by summing the counts by donor. The lowly expressed genes were removed, and we kept genes with at least 1 CPM (counts per million) in all samples.

Cells were co-cultured for 72 h prior to treatment with 50ug/ml oligomeric-Aβ or vehicle. After 24 h, both adherent and suspension cell fractions were collected, washed with PBS, and dissociated with accutase. Cells were washed in wash buffer [PBS, 2% BSA, 0.2U/μl RNAse inhibitor] and centrifuged at 300xg for 5 min at 4 °C, then filtered through 70 Flowmi strainers. Cells were counted using trypan blue on a Countess II (Invitrogen).\nWe prepared separate libraries from both the adherent and suspension cell fractions using 10X Genomics 3’ single-cell gene expression assays v3 and sequenced them on a NovaSeq 6000 to a depth of 50 k reads/cell.

We used GFAP and IBA1 because studies show that increased expression of GFAP [\nTo investigate the effects of Aβ plaques, we first stratified the 258,986 ST spots into three groups: no, low, and high Aβ, based on the average fluorescence intensity of Aβ in the corresponding 55-μm-diameter area from the two adjacent IHC stained sections (Fig.\nStratification of tissue microdomains by adjacent-section IHC intensities.\nTo examine the transcriptomic effects of Aβ, we first summed the expression values of all gray matter spots within a brain section for each stratified spot group (Fig.\nDifferential effects of low vs. high Aβ on the local transcriptome.\nGSEA on the low versus high Aβ contrasts shows reduced synaptic functions (Fig.\nFurthermore, we performed GSEA with specific genesets relevant to plaque-glia niches (Fig.\nAt the gene level, we detected lower expression of neuronal (\nTo examine differential Aβ effects on intercellular communications, we used NICHES [\nAβ plaques influence intercellular communication.\nTo test whether plaque-surrounding glia influences the local transcriptome within plaque-glia niches, we contrasted the glia-high versus glia-low gray matter spots with and without stratification by Aβ intensity (Fig.\nDifferential effects of glia abundance on the local transcriptome.\nTo assess the independent effects of astrocytes or microglia, we stratified and labeled spots based on the intensities of A-beta, GFAP and IBA1. For example, HHL denotes high A-beta, high GFAP, and low IBA1, respectively. We examined four contrasts: HHL vs. HLL, HLH vs. HLL, LHL vs. LLL, and LLH vs. LLL. After retaining brain sections with at least 50 spots for pseudobulk analysis, the number of available individuals per group was limited: 1 (HHL), 6 (HLH), 5 (HLL), 5 (LHL), 11 (LLH), and 15 (LLL). Due to these limited sample sizes, we detected minimal DEGs, except for LHL vs. LLL contrast, which revealed 133 DEGs.

By coupling ST readouts with IHC features of Aβ plaques and glial cells, we identify genes, pathways, and cell communication differences associated with distinct plaque-glia niches, shedding light on the cellular and molecular environments of plaque-related neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that low-Aβ areas, enriched for diffuse plaques, are more neurotoxic than high-Aβ areas and an increased abundance of reactive glia in plaque-glia niches exacerbates neurodegeneration. The glial response genes we identified by ST are enriched for multiple MG states identified by snRNA-seq of human AD brains. Importantly, exposure of co-cultured iMLCs to Aβ oligomers recapitulates the ST glial transcriptional response, as well as the reported MG states in human AD brains.\nBy contrasting low Aβ and high Aβ spots, we detected transcriptomic changes indicative of increased synaptic degeneration in the low Aβ spots. First, our DEG and GSEA analysis identified genes and functional pathways related to synaptic degeneration. Second, our NICHES analysis reveals more drastic LR differences related to neuronal and synaptic degeneration in the low Aβ spots. Third, our IHC validation experiment shows increased cleaved caspase-3 puncta co-localized with NeuN + nuclei and total nuclei near low Aβ plaques compared to high Aβ plaques. Thus, all our results point toward more detrimental effects in low Aβ spots. It is possible that we detected increased apoptosis and neuronal degeneration signatures in low Aβ spots because vulnerable neurons near high Aβ spots have already undergone cell death. This is consistent with our finding that the number of NeuN + nuclei is lower surrounding high Aβ plaques after normalizing by plaque area (Fig.\nThis observation is also concordant with a recent label-free vibrational imaging study showing that early-stage plaques consist mainly of toxic Aβ oligomers and protofibrils, whereas late-stage plaques primarily contain Aβ fibrils [\nAnother interesting observation gleaned from contrasting low Aβ and high Aβ spots is that surrounding glial cells influence the local transcriptome. For example, we detected an upregulation of ECM pathways in the glia-low condition and an upregulation of immune and apoptotic pathways in the glia-high condition (Fig.\nTo examine the effect of surrounding glia in the local plaque-glia niches, we contrasted glia-high versus glia-low spots in the low Aβ and high Aβ conditions. Our analysis indicates that the surrounding glia may mount a robust inflammatory response and exacerbate neurodegeneration, especially in the low Aβ spots. Our IHC validation experiments further validated this result, showing reduced neuronal/synaptic and increased inflammation marker expressions near glia-high plaques compared with glia-low plaques (Fig.\nFurthermore, our GSEA analysis shows that the ST glial response is enriched for signatures of reported mouse gene modules of plaque-induced genes (PIG), oligodendrocyte (OLIG) response, disease-associated microglia (DAM), and disease-associated astrocytes (DAA), as well as different microglia (MG) states identified in human AD brains, indicating that multiple glial cell states arise around plaques and contribute to local immune response. Among all the enriched MG states, MG3 is the most enriched in the ST glial response. This MG state has been shown to resemble mouse DAM and expresses inflammatory genes enriched for cytokine production, antigen presentation, and microglial activation [\nThe iPSC-derived microglia have been shown to recapitulate disease microglia states upon exposure to AD-related stimuli and master regulators [\nOur study demonstrates how advanced ST technology can be effectively combined with classical histology to address questions that neither approach can answer alone. This integrated workflow and computational framework offer a novel and accessible method for investigating pathological heterogeneity in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. By coupling ST data with traditional Aβ IHC staining, we provide new insights into the brain’s cellular and spatial context, linking the abundance of plaques and nearby reactive glia to neuronal vulnerability, synaptic degeneration, and inflammatory responses. Our study also highlights the power of integrating ST, snRNA-seq, and human cell models to decipher the sequential events and cell states in plaque-glia niches, indicating that diverse microglial activation states arise around Aβ plaques and that microglial response to toxic Aβ oligomers initiates glial activation. Overall, our research lays the groundwork for future pathology genomics, opening new avenues for addressing pathological heterogeneity in neurodegenerative diseases. Future studies with increased sample size and diversity, high-resolution spatial profiling platforms, the ability to work with fixed/archived tissues, and co-detection of proteins on the same section will address many technical challenges we encountered and enable finer delineation of cell-type-specific responses to distinct pathologies.\nThere were several limitations of this study. First, our ST samples were collected from aged female individuals (mean age of 92). Therefore, whether our results can generalize to younger age groups or males remains to be determined. Second, because Aβ spots primarily came from AD cases, we were underpowered to assess the intersection of AD status with the detected transcriptional signatures in plaque-glia niches. Third, as the Visium platform is at ~ 55-μm resolution and both astrocytes and microglia accompanied most plaque-containing spots, we were also underpowered to analyze astrocyte- and microglia-specific transcriptional responses in plaque niches. Fourth, due to frequent freezing artifacts of postmortem frozen tissue and the large size of this dataset (258,986 spots), we could not definitively categorize some of the plaques as the diffuse, compact, or dense core; thus, we used no, low and high Aβ to group the ST spots instead. Fifth, because of the relatively low resolution of the Visium platform and the limitation to choosing three proteins for IHC, we focused on extracellular Aβ pathology and surrounding glia to investigate the Aβ-glia niches. Future studies will investigate molecular responses to intracellular pathologies, such as neurofibrillary tangles, using high-resolution ST platforms. Finally, although our Aβ-treated microglia-like cells recapitulate major immune pathways and map partially to ex vivo microglial states, cultured microglia are known to diverge transcriptionally from in vivo microglia due to the absence of brain-specific environmental cues [\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary file1 (XLSX 149 KB)\nSupplementary file2 (XLSX 754 KB)\nSupplementary file3 (XLSX 610 KB)\nSupplementary file4 (XLSX 17 KB)\nSupplementary file5 (XLSX 18 KB)\nSupplementary file6 (XLSX 99 KB)\nSupplementary file7 (XLSX 40 KB)\nSupplementary file8 (XLSX 1665 KB)\nSupplementary file9 (CSV 57 KB)\nSupplementary file10 (XLSX 3431 KB)\nSupplementary file11 (XLSX 2087 KB)\nSupplementary file12 (XLSX 3568 KB)\nSupplementary file13 (XLSX 6085 KB)\nSupplementary file14 (DOCX 6.62 MB)", "content_for_embedding": "A defining pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. Microglia and astrocytes frequently cluster around these plaques, playing a crucial role in Aβ processing and plaque dynamics [\nRecent omics studies have identified genes and gene modules associated with Aβ plaques at both bulk and single-cell/nucleus levels [\nHere, we apply ST and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to 78 postmortem human brain sections from 21 individuals to obtain spatially resolved transcriptomic profiles alongside pathology measurements. With this large and unique dataset, we aim to decipher the interactions between Aβ plaques and glial cells by addressing two key questions: (1) What transcriptomic responses are associated with Aβ plaques in human brains? (2) How do plaque-associated glia cells influence these responses? By leveraging Aβ, GFAP, and IBA1 intensity measurements, we stratify ST spots into major types of plaque-glia niches, uncovering distinct differences in gene expression, cellular composition, and intercellular communication. We further validate the apoptotic and neuronal effects of Aβ and glial activation using IHC in postmortem brain sections. Our findings reveal exacerbated synaptic and neuronal loss in low-Aβ or high-glia areas, indicating the diverse roles of glial cell states in shaping the local immune response in AD.\nThe human brain tissues were obtained through the ROSMAP (Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project) cohort studies at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL. Written informed consent was given by the donors for brain autopsy and for the use of material and clinical data for research purposes, in compliance with national ethical guidelines. Clinicopathological information of the donor, including postmortem time, age, and sex, is recorded (Supplementary Table 1). Neuropathological diagnosis of the Aβ deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and other pathologies is provided (Supplementary Table 1). We selected 13 individuals clinically diagnosed as AD with high pathology and 8 controls with no cognitive impairment (NCI) and no or very little pathology. All individuals are female and matched for age. We chose all female individuals because there were insufficient males in the ROSMAP cohort matching our selection criteria (e.g. RIN > 5, age-matched, minimal freezing artifacts in frozen DLPFC). Frozen brain blocks of the right-hemisphere DLPFC from 21 individuals were cut (~ 1 cm\nFrozen brain blocks were embedded in OCT and cryosectioned coronally to a thickness of 10 μm using a Leica CM1950 cryostat set at −17C. Sectioning was done in sets of three (middle section for ST and two adjacent sections for IF), with 10–50 μm between each set. Sections were attached to Visium slides and stored at −80C in a slide mailer for up to one week before proceeding with spatial transcriptomics. ST-adjacent sections were attached to pre-labeled Leica superfrost plus slides and stored at −80C in slide mailers for up to two weeks before proceeding with immunohistochemistry.\nSpatial Transcriptomics was performed according to the Visium Spatial Gene Expression User Guide (10X Genomics;\nWe first attempted to perform IHC staining on the ST section, following 10X Genomics recommendations. However, due to the modified protocol required to preserve RNA integrity (i.e., methanol instead of PFA fixation, no antigen retrieval, shorter blocking, and antibody incubations), we were unable to obtain adequate staining quality. We decided instead to perform IHC on two ST-adjacent sections. Cryosectioned tissue on Leica super-frost slides was transferred from −80C to the lab on dry ice and quickly thawed for 1 min on a heat block at 37 C, then immediately transferred to a slide-mailer filled with PFA pre-equilibrated to 4 C and fixed at 4 C for 20 min. Slides were washed twice with DPBS before performing antigen retrieval for 10 min @ 95 C in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Following antigen retrieval, slides were washed three times with DPBS, a hydrophobic barrier was drawn surrounding the tissue (two sections per slide), and then sections were blocked for 1 h at RT in blocking buffer (DPBS containing 5% normal goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, and Human TruStain FcX (Fc blocker)). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies to detect Aβ (4G8), GFAP, and IBA1 (diluted in blocking buffer). The next day, the primary antibody solution was removed, and sections were washed three times with DPBS (5 min per wash). Sections were then incubated for 1.5 h at RT in the dark with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 for Aβ, Alexa Fluor 790 for GFAP, and Alexa Fluor 594 for IBA1) diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer. The secondary antibody solution was removed, and sections were washed four times with DPBS (5 min per wash), then incubated with DAPI to stain nuclei and Trueblack (according to the manufacturer’s instructions) to quench tissue autofluorescence. Slides were coverslipped and imaged on the ThermoFisher CellInsight CX7 LZR High Content Analysis Platform (HCA; 100 16-bit images per section).\nH&E images were acquired from ST sections with an Eclipse Ti2-E microscope (Nikon) at 20 × magnification in 9 × 9 tile tiff files with 10% overlap and were stitched into a single image per section with Adobe Photoshop (23.4.2 release). We note that some patches not covered by tissue could not be stitched, but tissue-covered areas were unaffected. To verify this, we confirmed alignment of spot coordinates to the H&E image. Fluorescent Aβ, GFAP, IBA1, and DAPI images were acquired from the two adjacent sections with the ThermoFisher HCA at 20 × magnification in 10 × 10 tile 16-bit tiff files. Background and shading correction were performed with the ImageJ plugin BaSiC [\nDue to the non-uniform intensity background across tiles and bright areas arising from artifacts such as tissue wrinkles and tears, we applied standard image processing techniques for further background correction and artifact removal. Using a structural element with a size well above that of amyloid plaques, microglia, and astrocytes, for each IF image, we performed grayscale opening and closing to extract large bright artifacts and local background inhomogeneity, which we regressed out from the image. With the artifact-corrected IHC images, we quantified the amount of amyloid, microglia, and astrocytes by averaging the intensity of pixels within each spot of the ST sections. We excluded spots near tissue borders overlapping with bright artifacts from our analysis.\nFFPE cortical sections were pre-heated for 60 min at 60 C in a dry oven and then rehydrated using a series of xylene and ethanol dilutions before rehydrating in DI water. Sections were then used for performing antigen retrieval for 20 min in boiling 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Following antigen retrieval, sections were washed with DPBS, incubated in 0.02N HCl for 20 min for peroxide blocking, washed with DPBS, and blocked for 1 h at RT in TNB blocking buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.5% Akoya blocking reagent; prepared as per manufacturer's instructions). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies diluted in the TNB blocking buffer to detect combinations of Aβ (4G8; 1:1000), GFAP (1:1500), IBA1 (1:200), cleaved Caspase-3 (1:250), NeuN (1:100), SYP (1:500) and/or CD68 (1:100). The following day, primary antibody solution was removed from sections, washed three times with TNT wash buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) (5 min per wash) and incubated for 1 h at RT in the dark with species-appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 568, Alexa Fluor 647, Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 790) diluted 1:1000 in DPBS. For cleaved Caspase-3 staining, the antibody was detected with a Mouse IgM-HRP secondary, incubated for 1 h at RT, followed by a 5 min incubation with tyramide Cy5. After secondary antibody incubation, sections were washed three times with TNT wash buffer (5 min per wash), then incubated with Trueblack for 1 min to quench tissue autofluorescence. Slides were washed two times with DPBS (5 min per wash), incubated with Hoechst 34580 (1:2000 in DPBS) for staining nuclei, mounted using Prolong antifade mountant and coverslipped. Slides were dried overnight at RT and imaged on the ThermoFisher HCA (200–300 16-bit images per section).\nIHC stained slides were imaged on the ThermoFisher HCA at 20x. 24 fields per section were selected to profile the thickness of the cortex from the meninges to the white matter for each subject. Images were processed using the compartmental analysis module in the HCA software. After background correction, 4G8 staining was used to identify plaque-like objects with the following parameters: objectarea > 20 μm, smoothing = 2. The 4G8-based objects were used as a mask to generate a region of interest (ROI) for the GFAP and IBA1 channels that encompassed both the object area and an extension from the edge of each object up to 25 μm without overlap. Calculated metrics, including the average ROI intensity for each channel, object size, and object shape, and counts were exported from the software. The data was filtered for an average 4G8 intensity > 2000. To adjust for technical differences in staining intensities between slides, the intensity data was scaled and centered for each case, and these resulting z-scores were used for subsequent plots. To classify plaques, an investigator blinded to the HCA measurements manually scored all 4G8-based objects as diffuse, compact, or dense core plaques (or as a staining artifact or vessel Aβ, both of which were excluded) yielding a final sample size of n = 722 plaques from n = 9 cases. For target intensity measurements, either the compartmental or colocalization analysis modules of the CellInsight system were used to define secondary objects and extract the average intensity and counts within each ROI. The top 25% of 4G8-based objects based on the scaled average 4G8 intensity was defined as high Aβ and the lower 75% as low Aβ. Objects with an ROI scoring in the top 25% for either scaled GFAP or scaled IBA1 average intensities were defined as glia-high and the remaining objects as glia-low. For NeuN (n = 10)/SYP(n = 9) (Fig.\nSequencing data were pre-processed with Space Ranger pipeline (10 × Genomics), which mapped the barcodes against the human genome (Gencode 27), generated FASTQ files, and generated a count matrix for each section. The individual files were then merged in a Seurat object (Seurat v4.2.0) and were processed in R. We calculated per-spot quality metrics and spots with low-measured genes (< 500) were removed. The Seurat::SCTransform function was used to normalize and scale the UMI counts based on regularized negative binomial regression. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the top 3000 variable genes. Using the top 50 PCs (Supplementary Fig.\nBenchmarking of data integration methods was performed using the\nDownsampling to 16 sections was performed using Seurat::Subset on the full dataset. Seurat pipeline was run as described above, resulting in 10 clusters that were manually annotated based on their similarity to those generated from the full dataset. BayesSpace was run with standard settings after merging all 16 sections into a single object (but with sections made spatially isolated from each other). Upon inspection of the qPlot (Supplementary Fig.\nWe performed co-expression network analysis using all spots and sections of the ST data. We created a pseudo-bulk gene expression matrix by summing the counts by donor. The lowly expressed genes were removed, and we kept genes with at least 1 CPM (counts per million) in all samples.

Cells were co-cultured for 72 h prior to treatment with 50ug/ml oligomeric-Aβ or vehicle. After 24 h, both adherent and suspension cell fractions were collected, washed with PBS, and dissociated with accutase. Cells were washed in wash buffer [PBS, 2% BSA, 0.2U/μl RNAse inhibitor] and centrifuged at 300xg for 5 min at 4 °C, then filtered through 70 Flowmi strainers. Cells were counted using trypan blue on a Countess II (Invitrogen).\nWe prepared separate libraries from both the adherent and suspension cell fractions using 10X Genomics 3’ single-cell gene expression assays v3 and sequenced them on a NovaSeq 6000 to a depth of 50 k reads/cell.

For example, HHL denotes high A-beta, high GFAP, and low IBA1, respectively. We examined four contrasts: HHL vs. HLL, HLH vs. HLL, LHL vs. LLL, and LLH vs. LLL. After retaining brain sections with at least 50 spots for pseudobulk analysis, the number of available individuals per group was limited: 1 (HHL), 6 (HLH), 5 (HLL), 5 (LHL), 11 (LLH), and 15 (LLL). Due to these limited sample sizes, we detected minimal DEGs, except for LHL vs. LLL contrast, which revealed 133 DEGs.

We first contrasted glia-high versus glia-low to identify differentially expressed LRs under low Aβ, high Aβ, and combined conditions (Supplementary Table 8).
