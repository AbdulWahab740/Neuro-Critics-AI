OSA is a highly prevalent condition, strongly associated with obesity and linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

As our understanding of the heterogenous factors driving OSA advances, novel therapies targeting specific physiological traits—such as arousal threshold, ventilatory instability, and upper airway muscle responsiveness—are being actively explored, with a promise to expand our therapeutic arsenal.

This incretin-based drug, previously approved for diabetes and obesity management, offers dual benefits, promoting weight loss and improving OSA severity and symptoms.

Introduced in the 90’s, APAP quickly became a key tool in sleep clinics, initially serving as a faster alternative to manual titration for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and later also as a long-term treatment option to expedite follow-up visits. APAP and CPAP are overall comparable in terms of adherence, efficacy and control of symptoms. However, concern remains that APAP offers less control of chronic health outcomes, such as blood pressure, kidney function and glycemic values. Other APAP-related challenges entail engineering aspects. A major issue is that APAP algorithms—which govern event detection/identification and pressure adjustments—are proprietary of and vary among manufacturers, making them poorly understood by clinicians. Furthermore, APAP algorithms do not always match-up well when compared to both manual titration or manually scored polysomnography, particularly in the presence of unintentional leak. Variability in event detection, leak compensation, and pressure adjustment algorithms among devices adds another layer of complexity to clinical decision-making. All this complicates the management of OSA patients, who could be left with substantial residual disordered breathing, high leak, and a wide pressure range.\nThis review aims to bridge the gap between the clinical and engineering perspectives of APAP, providing an up-to-date overview of current knowledge and existing challenges that sleep clinicians should consider when managing OSA patients with PAP therapy.", "full_text": "Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been the gold-standard for treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for over 40 years [\nTwo types of CPAP devices are currently available in the market: fixed-level CPAP and auto-adjusting CPAP (or APAP). Fixed-level CPAP—hereafter referred to simply as CPAP—delivers a pre-determined pressure during both inspiration and expiration, with each patient requiring a personalized pressure level that is set to prevent upper airway obstruction, but also to yield the least discomfort and avoid side effects. However, upper airway collapsibility can vary night-to-night with changes in sleep stage, body position, alcohol consumption and nasal obstruction [\nWith the growing prevalence of OSA and obesity [\nAdding to this challenge, there are few regulations or guidelines governing how manufacturers bring new devices or algorithms to the market [\nDespite substantial research, the effect of APAP on a variety of OSA outcomes is not completely clear, due to different results from numerous trials comparing its effectiveness vs. CPAP. In addition, data clearly showing how effectively APAP algorithms work are limited, with study results that are often inconsistent or not easily grasped by physicians. A comprehensive synthesis of existing evidence, integrating both updated clinical outcomes and technical aspects of device functioning to help sleep clinicians navigate the APAP black box, is currently missing from the medical literature. To address this, we assessed major online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Harvard Library) from their inception to the current date, and conducted a narrative review with the goal of summarizing what is known and highlighting existing gaps in medical and engineering knowledge to help strategize future research and development of PAP technologies in a way that is more accessible to the sleep community.\nShortly after its introduction and throughout the 2000s, the use of APAP progressively gained traction as a faster alternative to manual titration. Clinicians saw APAP as a way to titrate more patients and save on lab resources. The standard APAP titration approach involves using the device overnight for 1 to 7 days at home to determine P90 or P95, then switching to CPAP with a fixed pressure set to that value. Additional advantages over in-lab titration included reduced time to therapy initiation, improved access to care, and greater patient preference, as most patients intuitively prefer spending the night at home rather than in the lab [\nThere is general consensus that APAP titration addresses respiratory events similarly to in-lab titrations [\nCurrently, most patients are given an APAP device for both titration and treatment straight after OSA diagnosis. In a pre-pandemic study including ⁓2.6 million OSA patients, 50% of the prescribed devices were APAP, 41% were CPAP, and the remaining 9% were bilevel PAP or adaptive servo-ventilators [\nThere are several advantages of using APAP over CPAP. The overall process from titration to treatment initiation is likely cheaper when APAP is used [\nNevertheless, the main presumed advantage of chronic use of APAP over CPAP was improved overall treatment adherence, which has long been the primary limitation of PAP therapy [\nDespite the above and some early data suggesting greater APAP usage time [\n\nA meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials demonstrated no clinically significant difference in average hours of use in adults with obstructive sleep apnea treated with auto-titrating positive airway pressure (APAP) compared to continuous PAP (CPAP). In addition, a meta-analysis of 6 of these studies demonstrated no clinically significant difference in percent of nights PAP was used. Reproduced with permission from Patil et al. [\nMultiple studies have observed that the APAP-driven improvements in excessive daytime sleepiness measured via either the Epworth Sleepiness Scale or other tests (e.g., Osler, multiple wakefulness test) [\nBased on the above, a task force recommended no preference between APAP and CPAP for OSA patients without important comorbidities [\nSince APAP and CPAP are similar modalities, it has generally been assumed that APAP provides comparable protection against adverse health outcomes as CPAP. However, this is still controversial, as differences between the two treatment modalities have been reported (Fig.\n\nSummary illustration comparing the effects of auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on key treatment and health outcomes. The central axis represents outcomes with no significant difference between the two treatments, supported by reasonable evidence.

This ranking analysis was based on the surface of cumulative ranking curve area (SUCRA), which estimates the probability of a treatment being the “best” option among those compared. Treatments in Rank 1 are potentially more favorable than those in Rank 2, etc. Higher cumulative SUCRA values (percentages in brackets) indicate a stronger overall ranking by incorporating probabilities across all ranks. For example, even though OA and IC never rank first in the plot for daytime SBP, their probabilities of ranking in other positions contribute to their likelihood of being the best treatment in 13.63% and 23.73% of cases, respectively.

[\nAPAP seems to have little effect on glycemic control [\nIn addition, in a large cohort, it was demonstrated that APAP did not attenuate the progressive decline in kidney function observed in patients with chronic kidney disease as effectively as CPAP [\nSome authors have proposed that, in patients requiring frequent pressure adjustments throughout the night, APAP, may decrease sleep efficiency [\nIn contrast, one meta-analysis suggested that APAP led to increased slow-wave sleep vs. CPAP [\nNo differences in neurocognitive outcomes [\nFinally, while there is concern that PAP might be associated with adverse health outcomes [\nIt is important to keep in mind that many of the reported inconsistencies between studies might be due to differences in the APAP algorithms used, which are constantly evolving and now differ from those of the past (i.e., studies performed in different decades might not be comparable). Given the widespread use of APAP, a full understanding of these algorithms seems crucial to ensuring APAP is prescribed appropriately and tailored to patient needs.\nAPAP algorithms are designed to detect, in real time, apneas, hypopneas, and flow limitations, and differentiate between actual respiratory events and non-respiratory disruptions like coughing, swallowing, or mouth breathing. Additionally, the algorithms assess and quantify unintentional leak. Finally, they decide whether the pressure should change in response to automatically detected events and/or in the presence of unintentional leak. Inputs to the algorithms are measures of flow, pressure and a snoring detector (e.g., through vibrations in pressure). These signals are fed into a control unit that determines the corresponding pressure changes (Fig.\n\nSchematic diagram illustrating the functional principles of a device for applying automatic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). V′ and P\n\nReal-world example traces from an APAP device. Flow and pressure signals were synchronized with the oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO\nDifferent algorithms have different ways to quantify the flow signal (the algorithm foundation for event detection), but generally they filter the signal to distinguish between patient flow and leak. High-pass filtering removes offsets and isolates patient flow by eliminating leak, while low-pass filtering removes high-frequency content, such as breathing, to estimate leak. These filtering processes also help smooth out variability, i.e., reduce the impact of low-frequency (e.g., sighs, swallows, or brief flow interruptions such as irregular breathing activity during wake time) and high-frequency (e.g., cardiogenic artifacts) fluctuations in flow. The filtered signal is then used to determine an average value over a set period for further analysis. Once the signal is processed, the device evaluates changes in flow over different time windows to determine whether an event has occurred [\nFor example, Philips Respironics uses a method called weighted peak flow (WPF) to estimate flow, which first identifies the inspiratory period in the flow curve and then calculates the average inspiratory volume as the mean of the points falling between 20% and 80% of the flow curve (Fig.\n\nSignal processing methods. 180 and 181 refer to the start and the stop point detected by the algorithm for the flow curve analysis. 182, 184, 186 and 188 refer to the illustrated percentage in inspiratory volume. Flatness round baseline (FRB) is determined to find if there are any points between 5% and 95% of the flow curve that are below the 5% or the 95% of the flow value on the y axis. In practice, this is done to understand if there is any flow point in the middle of the flow curve that is below a line connecting the flow points at 5% and 95% of the curve. Roundness baseline (RB) is determined similarly, but using 20% and 80% of the flow curve. Flatness flat baseline (FFB) and Flatness baseline (FB) are calculated as the average of all flow points above FRB and RB, respectively. Hence, FB corresponds to weighted peak flow. The striped areas correspond to volume measures: the volume corresponding to FFB is A + B, while the volume corresponding to FB is B. Flow patterns 172, 174 and 176 are exemplified to illustrate that peak flow (Q\nBy contrast, ResMed uses a method known as root mean square of the variance of the flow to measure flow changes from breath to breath. Instead of looking at individual flow points in isolation, the algorithm calculates an average airflow over a set period and tracks deviations from that average, producing a continuous output called the breathing index (Fig.\nSimilarly, SleepRes devices [\n\nComparison of OSA severity detection between the APAP algorithms of Philips respironics and sleepres\n−0.2 [−0.8, 0.4]\n0.451\n−0.4 [−1.9, 1.4]\n0.669\n−0.1 [−0.7, 0.5]\n0.614\n−1.5 [−2.7, −0.0]\n0.046\n−0.4 [−1.9, 1.2]\n0.597\n−0.6 [−3.3, 2.4]\n0.661\n−0.2 [−1.2, 0.9]\n0.663\n−0.9 [−3.1, 1.6]\n0.448\nAll AHI values were square-root transformed for analysis and back transformed for presentation.

Sensitivity analyses with further adjustment for body mass index, age and race did not meaningfully affect the examined variables. Thirty-two participants were included in the analysis according to a modified intention to treat approach (i.e., if they performed at least one treatment visit). These data refer to a yet unpublished clinical trial which aimed to assess the effect of the SleepRes APAP vs. Philips Respironics APAP.

Initially, devices had different efficacy in identifying events, flow limitation [\nThe performance of the AED algorithm can be affected by unintentional leak [\nUnderstanding the limitations of AED-scoring for the follow-up of residual OSA is crucial. In fact, residual events while on PAP is a relatively frequent occurrence overall [\nIn summary, different algorithms, varying by manufacturer, are used in AED. While APAP and CPAP algorithms perform overall well, research suggests that the AHI\nOverall, when the leak is negligible and the AED-AHI is below 10 events/h, the patient is likely well treated [\nWhen severe residual OSA occurs during APAP therapy, a manual titration should be strongly considered. This is also the case when a large leak is suspected, when subjective sleepiness does not resolve despite adequate treatment adherence, or when there is a substantial change in BMI or the onset of a new comorbidity.\nConflicting evidence suggests that APAP devices may [\nEach manufacturer uses its own method to identify event types. When absence of flow is detected, Philips Respironics’s and SleepRes’s algorithms provide pressure pulses that induce (if the airway is open) or not (if the airway is obstructed) corresponding flow pulses, respectively flagging central or obstructive apneas. The main drawback of this method is that, when reviewing the waveform output from the device, the presence of multiple pulses within an event can make it challenging to determine which events are true apneas.\nConversely, Resmed uses the forced oscillation technique (FOT), a technology introduced in the ‘50s that generates sinusoidal pressure oscillations after about 4 seconds of no airflow, to measure resistance in the upper airway [\n\nExemplary sections from device data showing an obstructive apnea (\nThe main limitation of event classification algorithms is that they still cannot reliably discriminate between central and obstructive\nOnce the algorithm identifies the event type, one of two distinct pressure adjustment strategies, which varies by brand, follows. Broadly, these titration approaches are categorized as aggressive or soft. Aggressive algorithms react quickly with larger pressure adjustments to detected events, aiming for a rapid control of upper airway patency. However, they may increase the risk of arousals, mouth leak, over-titration, or even trigger central events. On the other hand, they generally handle leak better (Fig.\n\nPressure changes according to simulated obstructive apnea events with and without unintentional leak. The DreamStation device (soft algorithm) demonstrates smooth increases in pressure following onset of events, but minimal adjustments (Δ\nIn summary, event type discrimination remains a challenge for APAP and CPAP algorithms. Current technologies continue to be far from perfect in recognizing central vs. obstructive events, especially when it comes to hypopneas. Overall, algorithms incorporating FOT and those using a softer titration approach tend to perform better, but, once again, manual review of output waveforms is always recommended to ensure accurate patient management.\nAPAP represents an important technological advancement, offering efficacy and reduced costs when compared to manual, in-laboratory titration while providing the clear advantage of saving time and clinical resources. APAP is also largely equivalent to CPAP in terms of efficacy and adherence long-term. Although not every patient is put on APAP chronically, virtually all OSA patients are now given an APAP as their first device. Indeed, the auto-adjusting and the AED algorithms streamline outpatient follow-up of OSA patients, making APAP generally a practical choice for both clinicians and patients. Thus, at least from these standpoints, APAP constituted an important technological advancement in OSA management.\nHowever, several critical gaps remain. From a clinical-practical angle, it is still not clear whether the long-term effect of APAP on health outcomes is truly equal to that of CPAP. More research is needed on this topic, noting that existing data support fixed-level CPAP as starting therapy in patients with high blood pressure or chronic kidney disease. Second, the default 4–20 cmH\nFinally, APAP use is recommended only for otherwise healthy OSA patients [\nAddressing these knowledge gaps is essential to ensuring APAP is not just a convenient alternative to CPAP, but a truly effective and personalized therapy for all patients with OSA. Despite the availability of several APAP strategies and algorithms, most patients tend to get the same, very standardized treatment (especially within a sleep clinic, where clinicians get “accustomed” to a specific brand or device). However, in consideration of the still poor PAP adherence, it may be time, for both clinicians and engineers, to consider strategies to deliver a therapy that is really patient centered rather than defaulting to a one-size-fits-all approach.", "content_for_embedding": "Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been the gold-standard for treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for over 40 years [\nTwo types of CPAP devices are currently available in the market: fixed-level CPAP and auto-adjusting CPAP (or APAP).

For example, even though OA and IC never rank first in the plot for daytime SBP, their probabilities of ranking in other positions contribute to their likelihood of being the best treatment in 13.63% and 23.73% of cases, respectively.

[\nAPAP seems to have little effect on glycemic control [\nIn addition, in a large cohort, it was demonstrated that APAP did not attenuate the progressive decline in kidney function observed in patients with chronic kidney disease as effectively as CPAP [\nSome authors have proposed that, in patients requiring frequent pressure adjustments throughout the night, APAP, may decrease sleep efficiency [\nIn contrast, one meta-analysis suggested that APAP led to increased slow-wave sleep vs. CPAP [\nNo differences in neurocognitive outcomes [\nFinally, while there is concern that PAP might be associated with adverse health outcomes [\nIt is important to keep in mind that many of the reported inconsistencies between studies might be due to differences in the APAP algorithms used, which are constantly evolving and now differ from those of the past (i.e., studies performed in different decades might not be comparable). Given the widespread use of APAP, a full understanding of these algorithms seems crucial to ensuring APAP is prescribed appropriately and tailored to patient needs.\nAPAP algorithms are designed to detect, in real time, apneas, hypopneas, and flow limitations, and differentiate between actual respiratory events and non-respiratory disruptions like coughing, swallowing, or mouth breathing. Additionally, the algorithms assess and quantify unintentional leak. Finally, they decide whether the pressure should change in response to automatically detected events and/or in the presence of unintentional leak. Inputs to the algorithms are measures of flow, pressure and a snoring detector (e.g., through vibrations in pressure). These signals are fed into a control unit that determines the corresponding pressure changes (Fig.\n\nSchematic diagram illustrating the functional principles of a device for applying automatic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). V′ and P\n\nReal-world example traces from an APAP device. Flow and pressure signals were synchronized with the oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO\nDifferent algorithms have different ways to quantify the flow signal (the algorithm foundation for event detection), but generally they filter the signal to distinguish between patient flow and leak. High-pass filtering removes offsets and isolates patient flow by eliminating leak, while low-pass filtering removes high-frequency content, such as breathing, to estimate leak. These filtering processes also help smooth out variability, i.e., reduce the impact of low-frequency (e.g., sighs, swallows, or brief flow interruptions such as irregular breathing activity during wake time) and high-frequency (e.g., cardiogenic artifacts) fluctuations in flow. The filtered signal is then used to determine an average value over a set period for further analysis. Once the signal is processed, the device evaluates changes in flow over different time windows to determine whether an event has occurred [\nFor example, Philips Respironics uses a method called weighted peak flow (WPF) to estimate flow, which first identifies the inspiratory period in the flow curve and then calculates the average inspiratory volume as the mean of the points falling between 20% and 80% of the flow curve (Fig.\n\nSignal processing methods. 180 and 181 refer to the start and the stop point detected by the algorithm for the flow curve analysis. 182, 184, 186 and 188 refer to the illustrated percentage in inspiratory volume. Flatness round baseline (FRB) is determined to find if there are any points between 5% and 95% of the flow curve that are below the 5% or the 95% of the flow value on the y axis. In practice, this is done to understand if there is any flow point in the middle of the flow curve that is below a line connecting the flow points at 5% and 95% of the curve. Roundness baseline (RB) is determined similarly, but using 20% and 80% of the flow curve. Flatness flat baseline (FFB) and Flatness baseline (FB) are calculated as the average of all flow points above FRB and RB, respectively. Hence, FB corresponds to weighted peak flow. The striped areas correspond to volume measures: the volume corresponding to FFB is A + B, while the volume corresponding to FB is B. Flow patterns 172, 174 and 176 are exemplified to illustrate that peak flow (Q\nBy contrast, ResMed uses a method known as root mean square of the variance of the flow to measure flow changes from breath to breath. Instead of looking at individual flow points in isolation, the algorithm calculates an average airflow over a set period and tracks deviations from that average, producing a continuous output called the breathing index (Fig.\nSimilarly, SleepRes devices [\n\nComparison of OSA severity detection between the APAP algorithms of Philips respironics and sleepres\n−0.2 [−0.8, 0.4]\n0.451\n−0.4 [−1.9, 1.4]\n0.669\n−0.1 [−0.7, 0.5]\n0.614\n−1.5 [−2.7, −0.0]\n0.046\n−0.4 [−1.9, 1.2]\n0.597\n−0.6 [−3.3, 2.4]\n0.661\n−0.2 [−1.2, 0.9]\n0.663\n−0.9 [−3.1, 1.6]\n0.448\nAll AHI values were square-root transformed for analysis and back transformed for presentation. Models were adjusted for period, sequence, baseline AHI and percent of time spent sleeping supine in the corresponding sleep stage. Sensitivity analyses with further adjustment for body mass index, age and race did not meaningfully affect the examined variables. Thirty-two participants were included in the analysis according to a modified intention to treat approach (i.e., if they performed at least one treatment visit). These data refer to a yet unpublished clinical trial which aimed to assess the effect of the SleepRes APAP vs. Philips Respironics APAP. PR, Philips Respironics; APAP, auto-adjusting positive airway pressure; AHI\nIncrements in PAP are delivered based on flow reductions, and each machine has its own way to respond to alterations in flow (Fig.\n\nExample flow and pressure traces to illustrate the main principles of the titration algorithms of two manufacturers [\nBut how well does this AED algorithm perform? Initially, devices had different efficacy in identifying events, flow limitation [\nThe performance of the AED algorithm can be affected by unintentional leak [\nUnderstanding the limitations of AED-scoring for the follow-up of residual OSA is crucial. In fact, residual events while on PAP is a relatively frequent occurrence overall [\nIn summary, different algorithms, varying by manufacturer, are used in AED. While APAP and CPAP algorithms perform overall well, research suggests that the AHI\nOverall, when the leak is negligible and the AED-AHI is below 10 events/h, the patient is likely well treated [\nWhen severe residual OSA occurs during APAP therapy, a manual titration should be strongly considered. This is also the case when a large leak is suspected, when subjective sleepiness does not resolve despite adequate treatment adherence, or when there is a substantial change in BMI or the onset of a new comorbidity.\nConflicting evidence suggests that APAP devices may [\nEach manufacturer uses its own method to identify event types. When absence of flow is detected, Philips Respironics’s and SleepRes’s algorithms provide pressure pulses that induce (if the airway is open) or not (if the airway is obstructed) corresponding flow pulses, respectively flagging central or obstructive apneas. The main drawback of this method is that, when reviewing the waveform output from the device, the presence of multiple pulses within an event can make it challenging to determine which events are true apneas.\nConversely, Resmed uses the forced oscillation technique (FOT), a technology introduced in the ‘50s that generates sinusoidal pressure oscillations after about 4 seconds of no airflow, to measure resistance in the upper airway [\n\nExemplary sections from device data showing an obstructive apnea (\nThe main limitation of event classification algorithms is that they still cannot reliably discriminate between central and obstructive\nOnce the algorithm identifies the event type, one of two distinct pressure adjustment strategies, which varies by brand, follows. Broadly, these titration approaches are categorized as aggressive or soft. Aggressive algorithms react quickly with larger pressure adjustments to detected events, aiming for a rapid control of upper airway patency. However, they may increase the risk of arousals, mouth leak, over-titration, or even trigger central events. On the other hand, they generally handle leak better (Fig.\n\nPressure changes according to simulated obstructive apnea events with and without unintentional leak. The DreamStation device (soft algorithm) demonstrates smooth increases in pressure following onset of events, but minimal adjustments (Δ\nIn summary, event type discrimination remains a challenge for APAP and CPAP algorithms. Current technologies continue to be far from perfect in recognizing central vs. obstructive events, especially when it comes to hypopneas. Overall, algorithms incorporating FOT and those using a softer titration approach tend to perform better, but, once again, manual review of output waveforms is always recommended to ensure accurate patient management.\nAPAP represents an important technological advancement, offering efficacy and reduced costs when compared to manual, in-laboratory titration while providing the clear advantage of saving time and clinical resources. APAP is also largely equivalent to CPAP in terms of efficacy and adherence long-term. Although not every patient is put on APAP chronically, virtually all OSA patients are now given an APAP as their first device. Indeed, the auto-adjusting and the AED algorithms streamline outpatient follow-up of OSA patients, making APAP generally a practical choice for both clinicians and patients. Thus, at least from these standpoints, APAP constituted an important technological advancement in OSA management.\nHowever, several critical gaps remain. From a clinical-practical angle, it is still not clear whether the long-term effect of APAP on health outcomes is truly equal to that of CPAP. More research is needed on this topic, noting that existing data support fixed-level CPAP as starting therapy in patients with high blood pressure or chronic kidney disease. Second, the default 4–20 cmH\nFinally, APAP use is recommended only for otherwise healthy OSA patients [\nAddressing these knowledge gaps is essential to ensuring APAP is not just a convenient alternative to CPAP, but a truly effective and personalized therapy for all patients with OSA. Despite the availability of several APAP strategies and algorithms, most patients tend to get the same, very standardized treatment (especially within a sleep clinic, where clinicians get “accustomed” to a specific brand or device). However, in consideration of the still poor PAP adherence, it may be time, for both clinicians and engineers, to consider strategies to deliver a therapy that is really patient centered rather than defaulting to a one-size-fits-all approach.", "topic": "Sleep_disorder"}

We show that AHI is ~5% higher during summer/winter compared to spring/autumn in the northern hemisphere, and 10–15% higher during summer compared to spring in the southern hemisphere. Ambient temperature and variation in sleep duration partially explained these results. Results are consistent across 23 countries.\nThis study is a retrospective analysis of data from 125,295 participants who bought, setup and registered to use an FDA-approved under-mattress sleep sensor for personal use (Withings Sleep Analyzer; WSA) between January 2020 and September 2023.

For continuous outcomes we used the gaussian family with identity link function for the regression models. In some sensitivity analyses with a binary outcome, we used binomial family with logit link function. We modelled seasonal effects using natural splines of time (Julian day 1–365; with 8 degrees of freedom [df]) and further controlled for an indicator of day of the week in our baseline model. Since the day of the year is a construct variable that may encompass multiple different exposures variables including behavior (e.g., sleep, physical activity) and/or weather changes (e.g., temperature, cloud cover), we ran a fully adjusted model to investigate if seasonal effect persisted after adjustment for the following potential confounders: total cloud cover (4 df), relative humidity (4 df), air pollution (4 df), wind speed (4 df), surface pressure (4 df), yearly sleep duration irregularity (4 df), and yearly sleep timing irregularity (4 df). This analysis approach was first undertaken in different latitude categories (−90 to −30⁰, 30 to 0⁰, 0 to 30⁰  and 30 to 90⁰) and then in countries with at least 200 users. Secondary analyses examined specific subgroups of interest including age (10 y bins), sex, habitual sleep duration categories ( < 6, 6 to 7, 7 to 8, 8 to 9 and 9+ hours) and OSA severity categories (mild, moderate and severe). Estimated marginal means and 95%CI are reported in all figures.\nTo further explore the potential associations between environmental variables and percentage AHI change, we constructed two additional models per variable of interest. These predictors included: 24 h average temperature, total cloud cover, relative humidity, wind speed, air pollution, surface pressure, sleep duration irregularity, and sleep timing irregularity. The first model for each predictor was adjusted for the day of the year and the day of the week, and the second model was adjusted for additional potential confounders.

The summer peak is likely to be partly explained by increased ambient temperatures, which were associated with a 2 to 15% increase in AHI severity consistently across the 23 studied countries. We also found that sleeping longer than the yearly average was associated with a further 3 to 10% increase in AHI severity, which may partially account for the peak in winter. Together, these findings have important implications for the diagnosis and long-term management of OSA and global sleep health implications.\nThere are several factors that may influence night-to-night variability in OSA severity. These factors include body/head position during sleep, circadian effects, sleep stage distributions and timing, changes in non-anatomical OSA endotypes, nasal resistance, and behavioural and lifestyle factors such as nutrition, physical activity, social activities, alcohol, caffeine use, tobacco intake, and medication use\nDuring winter, people tend to sleep ~20 min longer which may be explained by extended wake-up time (25 min later compared to summer) rather than earlier bedtime\nTaken together, all available potential sources of variability investigated in the current study (i.e., seasonal, environmental, temperature and sleep-effects) remained modest and suggest that other factors must play a key influential role in mediating night-to-night variability in OSA severity. Ambient temperature and seasonal variation in sleep duration were the two main factors influencing seasonal variation in AHI. Indeed, while present, the influence of other factors such as high wind speed, surface pressure, air pollution, and variable sleep timing on AHI variability were small. Nonetheless, a seasonal effect that accounts for ~20% of the variation in AHI is meaningful. Some pharmacological trials in OSA patients only show modest reductions in OSA severity, such as a 10 to 20% reduction\nThere are some limitations with our study which should be considered when interpreting the findings. Clinical information regarding co-morbid conditions, sleepiness, and treatment status were unavailable. Some behavioural information such as alcohol intake and smoking status that could have helped understand the mechanisms behind a seasonal pattern of OSA were also unavailable. Information on participants socio-demographics was also unavailable. Similarly, the lack of more precise geographical locations than nearest major city may have limited our ability to detect some associations with environmental variables. In addition, we had to rely on outdoor ambient temperature, and we had no information on air conditioning/heating usage. This may have confounded some of the associations at the country level. For example, the association between high temperature and AHI had a lower effect size in the United States compared to other countries, which is also one of the countries with the largest usage of air conditioning worldwide\nThe estimated AHI from the under- mattress sensor includes fewer input variables in which to detect respiratory events compared to conventional polysomnography. Accordingly, other physiological aspects of OSA (e.g., hypoxia, posture) as well as event-specific characteristics such as ventilatory burden, ventilatory drive, central vs obstructive events cannot be measured. However, validation studies in over 150 participants support the device performance characteristics with minimal bias versus polysomnography AHI\nUsing data collected with an under-mattress sleep sensor over a 3.5-year period, we observed a seasonal effect on OSA severity, with sleep duration extension and ambient temperatures explaining some of these associations. These findings highlight that decision-making based on brief recording periods may not represent longer-term trends in OSA severity. They also suggest the importance of time-matched controls in OSA treatment studies and the need to report data collection months in OSA clinical trials. Further studies to determine the physiological mechanisms underpinning the seasonal variation in OSA severity are required.\n\nTransparent Peer Review file\nSupplementary Material\nSupplemental Data legends\nSupplemental Data 1\nSupplemental Data 2\nReporting Summary", "content_for_embedding": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most prevalent sleep-related breathing disorder, estimated to affect 1 billion adults globally\nThere is considerable night-to-night variability in OSA severity which leads to diagnostic misclassification in 20–50% of patients\nSome studies have focused on environmental factors that may partially explain potential seasonal variation in OSA severity, such as ambient temperature and air pollution\nIn this study, we use multi-night, longitudinal measurements of OSA severity using a validated under-mattress sensor in ~70,000 people with OSA, collected over ~3.5 years across multiple geographical locations to estimate seasonal variations in OSA severity, adjusting for key confounders including environmental factors, sleep duration and timing variability.

The summer peak is likely to be partly explained by increased ambient temperatures, which were associated with a 2 to 15% increase in AHI severity consistently across the 23 studied countries. We also found that sleeping longer than the yearly average was associated with a further 3 to 10% increase in AHI severity, which may partially account for the peak in winter. Together, these findings have important implications for the diagnosis and long-term management of OSA and global sleep health implications.\nThere are several factors that may influence night-to-night variability in OSA severity. These factors include body/head position during sleep, circadian effects, sleep stage distributions and timing, changes in non-anatomical OSA endotypes, nasal resistance, and behavioural and lifestyle factors such as nutrition, physical activity, social activities, alcohol, caffeine use, tobacco intake, and medication use\nDuring winter, people tend to sleep ~20 min longer which may be explained by extended wake-up time (25 min later compared to summer) rather than earlier bedtime\nTaken together, all available potential sources of variability investigated in the current study (i.e., seasonal, environmental, temperature and sleep-effects) remained modest and suggest that other factors must play a key influential role in mediating night-to-night variability in OSA severity. Ambient temperature and seasonal variation in sleep duration were the two main factors influencing seasonal variation in AHI. Indeed, while present, the influence of other factors such as high wind speed, surface pressure, air pollution, and variable sleep timing on AHI variability were small. Nonetheless, a seasonal effect that accounts for ~20% of the variation in AHI is meaningful. Some pharmacological trials in OSA patients only show modest reductions in OSA severity, such as a 10 to 20% reduction\nThere are some limitations with our study which should be considered when interpreting the findings. Clinical information regarding co-morbid conditions, sleepiness, and treatment status were unavailable. Some behavioural information such as alcohol intake and smoking status that could have helped understand the mechanisms behind a seasonal pattern of OSA were also unavailable. Information on participants socio-demographics was also unavailable. Similarly, the lack of more precise geographical locations than nearest major city may have limited our ability to detect some associations with environmental variables. In addition, we had to rely on outdoor ambient temperature, and we had no information on air conditioning/heating usage. This may have confounded some of the associations at the country level. For example, the association between high temperature and AHI had a lower effect size in the United States compared to other countries, which is also one of the countries with the largest usage of air conditioning worldwide\nThe estimated AHI from the under- mattress sensor includes fewer input variables in which to detect respiratory events compared to conventional polysomnography. Accordingly, other physiological aspects of OSA (e.g., hypoxia, posture) as well as event-specific characteristics such as ventilatory burden, ventilatory drive, central vs obstructive events cannot be measured. However, validation studies in over 150 participants support the device performance characteristics with minimal bias versus polysomnography AHI\nUsing data collected with an under-mattress sleep sensor over a 3.5-year period, we observed a seasonal effect on OSA severity, with sleep duration extension and ambient temperatures explaining some of these associations. These findings highlight that decision-making based on brief recording periods may not represent longer-term trends in OSA severity. They also suggest the importance of time-matched controls in OSA treatment studies and the need to report data collection months in OSA clinical trials. Further studies to determine the physiological mechanisms underpinning the seasonal variation in OSA severity are required.\n\nTransparent Peer Review file\nSupplementary Material\nSupplemental Data legends\nSupplemental Data 1\nSupplemental Data 2\nReporting Summary", "topic": "Sleep_disorder"}

Though cancer gradually becomes a chronic disease that can be controlled through continuous treatment, the scientific community has begun to pay attention to the physical and emotional issues that cancer and its treatment cause for cancer survivors. This review focuses on sleep disorders, which is quite common yet frequently overlooked in cancer survivors. Epidemiological and experimental data have demonstrated an inherent relationship between cancer and sleep disorders. This relationship may harm treatment adherence, quality of life, and survival rate of patients. This article systematically introduces the epidemiology, influencing factors, and underlying mechanisms of cancer-related sleep disorders.

The search strategy consisted of two themes, and search terms used for sleep disorders included “sleep” “sleep disorders” “insomnia” “sleep disruption” and “obstructive sleep apnea syndrome”. The following terms were used for cancer: “cancer” “malignant tumor” and “malignant tumour”. To avoid bias due to frequent database updates, all literature searches and data downloads were completed within 1 day, August 28, 2024.We manually screened observational studies using cross-sectional, case-control, retrospective, or prospective cohort designs, studies exploring the impact of sleep disorders on the development of cancer, and studies identifying sleep disorders in patients with cancer through questionnaires, interviews, or clinical diagnosis. This study provides a thorough introduction to the screening for and incidence of sleep disorders in patients with cancer, and analyzes the factors that may contribute to the onset of the symptom during cancer treatment, which will help in the prevention and treatment strategies for sleep disorders. In addition, the impact of sleep disorders on the body of patients with cancer, current common treatment measures, as well as the possible underlying mechanisms of sleep disorders and cancer are also discussed.\nSleep disorders generally refer to disorders in the quality of sleep such as abnormal sleep, or the normal rhythm of sleep and wakefulness alternately occur, the difficulty to start and maintain sleep, and excessive somnolence disease. Among these disorders, insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are the most common. Insomnia is often characterized by difficulty falling or staying asleep when there is adequate opportunity for sleep and is associated with various adverse complications (\nSleep disorders can be evaluated by numerous methods(\nCommon screening methods for sleep disorders.\nPSQI, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; AIS, Athens Insomnia Scale; PROMIS, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System.\nSleep disorders, arising during different phases of cancer diagnosis and treatment, rank among the most excruciating symptoms endured by cancer survivors. According to a Swedish study, 20–30% of adults frequently suffer from sleep disorders, and cancer survivors are 2–3 times more likely to experience sleep disorders (\nThe incidence of sleep disorders in various literature and reports differs widely. Davidson found in a large sample that about one-third of patients with cancer experience excessive sleepiness and insomnia, and nearly one-fifth sleep more than usual (\nIt is worth noting that compared to the extensive literature on cancer, there are relatively few studies examining sleep disorders in patients with cancer. In addition, most studies used convenient small samples and relied on cross-sectional designs. Few studies have applied diagnostic criteria for insomnia to estimate prevalence in a randomized sample of patients with cancer, and most rely on one or two self-report scales. This has led to a high degree of heterogeneity in the prevalence of sleep disorders between reports.\nPatients with various types of cancer frequently experience sleep disorders. Cancer-related sleep disorders, including insomnia, hot flashes, sleepiness, and nightmares, are frequently brought on by the psychological fallout from receiving a cancer diagnosis, and the direct effects and adverse effects of cancer treatment. The exact cause of sleep disorders resulting from cancer remains mostly unknown due to the variability in cancer types, available treatments, patient demographics, and lifestyle choices.\nThe circadian clock regulates sleep, and the central clock of the brain serves as a pacemaker for other molecular clocks in the peripheral organs, synchronizing sleep with external cues like light and food availability. The sleep wake cycle is determined by the inherent biological clock or circadian rhythm. The sleep phase occurs in a repetitive pattern or cycle of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM), with each cycle lasting approximately 90 minutes (\nThe diagnosis and treatment of cancer seem to be associated with high levels of insomnia symptoms. One such example is the population with ovarian cancer, where the most common risk factor for sleep disorders is severe pain upon diagnosis. Tumor physiology itself may also play an important role here, such as the tumor or tumor microenvironment’s secretion of cytokines affecting metabolism and energy balance during sleep. According to a large longitudinal population survey, 31% of patients experience symptoms of insomnia in the perioperative period, and nearly 30% of patients match the diagnostic criteria for insomnia syndrome. In that study, 2 months later, the insomnia symptoms were relieved, and the remission rate was 32% (\nSleep problems often arise after surgical intervention. Poor postoperative sleep quality was present in over 70% of patients with cancer compared to baseline, and this condition tended to continue post-therapy (\nBreast cancer has been linked to the highest incidence of sleeplessness when compared to other cancers, such as those of the prostate, gynecological, head and neck, urinary, or gastrointestinal. It characterizes low sleep efficiency, frequent wakefulness at night, long wakefulness after sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Besides the physical discomfort, pain, and hot flashes caused by breast cancer itself, the patient is highly uncertain about the treatment outcome. Concerns about body shape and hormonal changes caused by hormonal therapy can lead to sleep disorders in patients. Koopman et al. discovered that 63% of women with metastatic breast cancer had sleep difficulties (\nThere exists a complex, two-way, chicken-or-egg link between sleep disorders and cancer. Cancer seems to cause sleep disorders, which, in turn, contribute to the development and progression of cancer (\nRecent research reports suggest that individuals with sleep difficulties or diagnosed with sleep disorders at any point in their lives are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer (\nAnother prevalent sleep issue among patients with cancer is OSAS. OSAS is a very common sleep breathing disorder, but it is severely underestimated in clinical practice. The pathophysiological processes related to OSAS, such as fragmented sleep and intermittent hypoxia, may affect normal neuroendocrine regulation and impair the body’s immune function (\nSleep disturbances can encourage cancer cells to proliferate and migrate. It is likely that sleep disorders-induced circadian rhythm disturbances, decreased melatonin secretion, and inflammatory responses result in unregulated cell proliferation. Circadian disruptions can influence the expression of genes linked to tumor development and metastasis, DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (\nSeveral studies have reported a 3.4-to 4.8-fold increase in mortality in patients with cancer having OSAS (\nEpidemiological statistics indicate a correlation between anxiety and depression and a higher likelihood of sleep problems. Conversely, those who already have sleep disorders typically exhibit greater symptoms of anxiety and despair; There may be a vicious circle between the two. A substantial amount of evidence indicate that sleep disorders are independent risk factors for depression in healthy individuals and older individuals (\nA direct link between sleep disorders and memory problems in humans and animals has been often shown (\nResearch has found that sleep problems in cancer patients are associated with lower clinical prognosis and quality of life (\nExcessive daytime sleepiness and sleep disturbance impact fatigue and its perception. Sleep disorders are thought to be a cause of cancer-related fatigue and often accompany cancer-related fatigue (\nPatients with cancer frequently experience sleep disorders; therefore, prevention or treatment of sleep disorders, especially in the early stages of personalized treatment, can help reduce cancer-related pain, fatigue, and mental health issues like anxiety and depression. It is also possible to prevent the development, preservation, and/or deterioration of cancer, which can improve quality of life and survival rate of patients with cancer.\nPharmacological methods are among the most popular choices for treating sleep disturbances in cancer survivors, particularly in their acute stage. This is like the general population with sleep disorders. Common pharmacologic therapies include symptomatic medications (such as pain, diarrhea, and cough relief) and the use of benzodiazepine-based and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, as proposed by Pillai et al. (\nAlthough drug therapy has been widely attempted and considered beneficial for sleep, guidelines are still recommended for its short-term use (2–4 weeks), combined with long-term lifestyle changes and immediate management. Drugs cannot reconstruct normal sleep structures while improving sleep quality. Generally, it is helpful for any form of insomnia in the short term. If taken for too long, sleep regulation will be externalized, and once stopped, it is likely to rebound. In addition, long-term use of hypnotic drugs can lead to cognitive deterioration, increased fall and fracture rates (\nPatients with cancer frequently experience chronic sleep disturbance, and nonpharmacologic therapy may be helpful since it reduces the possible negative effects of long-term drug use. Common methods include CBT, exercise, massage, and relaxation therapy and improve the patient’s sleep environment.\nStudies have shown that CBT provides lasting improvement in insomnia, and the American College of Physicians recommends CBT-I as a first-line treatment (\nExercise, which includes yoga, walking, and other non-pharmacological treatments, is thought to help patients with cancer sleep better. It has also been demonstrated to lessen fatigue in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy (\nMassage and relaxation therapy is also one of the non-drug treatment methods. A recent study found that acupuncture and massage can help relieve pain in patients with advanced cancer, improve fatigue, insomnia and quality of life (\nRecent evidence suggests that PBM, and specifically intravascular laser blood irradiation (ILIB), can significantly improve insomnia (\nThe sleep environment is also crucial to improving sleep quality, especially during hospitalization. The two most common things that disrupt sleep are light and noise. A well-established sleeping environment is dark, quiet, and comfortable, which can effectively promote sleep quality. The common interventions include earplugs and eye masks. These can filter out light and noise, lengthen and deepen sleep, lower pain thresholds, and lessen the frequency of nighttime awakenings (\nIn the past few years, music therapy has received great attention in patients with sleep disorders and depression due to its non-invasive nature and minimal side effects. It improves sleep by regulating cortisol, releasing dopamine, and soothing autonomic nervous system (\nGood sleep helps patients with cancer have a better prognosis and quality of life, so addressing their sleep issues at the time of diagnosis, throughout therapy, and after treatment is crucial. The sleep scale should be used regularly by clinicians to evaluate patients’ sleep while screening for possible sleep disorders, such as prolonged sleep latency, frequent wakefulness and decreased sleep efficiency, fatigue, and drowsiness during the day, loud snoring, inappropriate behavior at night, and/or nightmares. It is worth noting that anxiety and depression in patients with cancer are important factors contributing to sleep disorders, and managing anxiety and depression seems to be necessary and should be the target of intervention. At present, the common treatments for anxiety and depression include antidepressant medication, psychological intervention, music therapy, recall therapy, CBT, and electronic health intervention. In addition, breathing problems during sleep should also be taken into account. For example, patients with lung cancer may experience inadequate ventilation during sleep (\nEndogenous cycles in physiology, hormones, and behavioral processes known as circadian rhythms regulate physiological and behavioral activities of each organ to maintain systemic homeostasis. Several key biological processes are regulated by circadian rhythms, including the sleep-wake cycle, food-fast cycle, and activity-rest cycle. Among them, the sleep-wake cycle is most likely the most well-known biological process that adheres to a 24-hour circadian rhythm (\nAlterations in the circadian rhythm lead to many kinds of diseases. Chronic sleep deprivation or excessive sleep, subhealthy lifestyle, shift work, and exposure to artificial and blue light at night have blurred the lines between day and night and raised the likelihood of disrupted circadian rhythms. The disruption of central and peripheral clocks, which causes extensive dysregulation of clock biological processes, ultimately leading to several diseases, such as obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and mental and neurological disorders.\nOn the other hand, the Circadian clock is essential for cell cycle regulation, and changes in clock function can lead to abnormal proliferation, growth, and DNA damage in cancer cells (\nThe hypothalamus is an essential component of the brain consisting of multiple nuclei that create and preserve systemic physiological equilibrium. It is critical for regulating sleep/wake behavior, body temperature, sexual behavior, appetite and completion stages of eating, system energy balance, and circadian rhythms (\nOn the other hand, dual-receptor antagonism promoted deep restorative sleep in tumor-bearing mice, which reduced the HO signal. The aberrant activity of these neuronal populations could be attributed to sleep disruption due to altered immunological, metabolic, or endocrine functioning caused by cancer. McAlpine and colleagues have shown that long, scattered sleep dramatically reduces the number of HO neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, a phenotype associated with arteriosclerosis development. Sleep and memory disorders in patients with cancer may be exacerbated by the dysfunction of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-promoting neurons, which are susceptible to peripheral inputs that become unregulated (\nFunctional alterations of the HPA axis are a common phenomenon in patients with cancer, characterized mainly by elevated corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH), which leads to abnormally high levels of glucocorticoid and catecholamine. Elevated cortisol can suppress the body’s immune function. According to a large number of studies, dysfunction of the HPA axis in cancer patients, such as pituitary tumors, neurosurgery and radiation therapy of the tumor, can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders (\nTumors modify the activity of cells in both their immediate and distant environments to avoid detection by the immune system and meet the metabolic needs for growth, multiplication, and metastasis. These cells include T cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages in the liver and brain (\nAdequate sleep is crucial for maintaining strong immune function, which plays a key role in cancer prevention through mechanisms such as immune surveillance (\nSleep disorders, immune system, and inflammation. The normal sleep cycle maintains the normal function of the immune system by regulating the balance of the expression of cytokines, which is beneficial to the transfer of antigens. Chronic sleep disorders disrupt the circadian rhythm, affecting the normal function of the immune system, leading to inflammatory reactions in the body, including systemic inflammation, cellular inflammation, and inflammatory transcriptional activity, ultimately leading to chronic diseases such as cancer and depression.\nSleep disturbances affect DNA damage and repair. Sleep deprivation lowers melatonin levels, which increases oxidative damage of the DNA (\nSleep disorders, DNA damage and repair. Sleep disorders lead to the occurrence of cancers. On the one hand, sleep disorders can lower melatonin levels, which are important antioxidants that may lead to increased DNA oxidative damage. On the other hand, sleep disorders downregulate the expression of genes involved in DNA repair, such as ERCC6, PARP1 and RAD50.\nOther less clear mechanisms include changes in blood glucose levels, amino acid concentrations, and pH levels. So far, the link between sleep cancer and depression is not fully elucidated, and more research is needed.\nPeople with cancer often experience sleep disorders after cancer treatment, but they are often underestimated in practice. Sleep disorders symptom often overlap with cancer pain or physical fatigue and is difficult to differentiate, in addition to the accuracy of screening tools, the diversity of cancer types and treatment modalities. All this makes current research on sleep disorders in patients with cancer challenging. Based on the literature, the causes of the symptom in patients with cancer is not only related to physical pain, digestive tract reaction, fatigue, nervous system changes caused by primary cancer and treatment methods, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, gender, age, primary disease, marital status, the levels of education and economic, and social support all contribute to the occurrence of sleep disorders in patients with cancer. Similarly, the development of the symptom in turn increases the incidence of cancer, affects cognition and memory, reduces quality of life, and ultimately reduces the survival rate of patients with cancer. Current research suggests that sleep disorders may be an early signal of cancer, and as sleep problems are modifiable lifestyle factors, early screening and intervention for sleep disorders may provide unique intervention targets for cancer prevention. Future research should focus on reducing risk factors for sleep disorders in patients with cancer, establishing standardized assessment tools to measure sleep disorders, providing regular monitoring, early identification, and effective management, and evaluating the long-term benefits of sleep interventions in cancer prevention and treatment. At present, drug therapy is still the main treatment for sleep disorders in patients with cancer. However, research has shown that drug therapy has many side effects and is more suitable for short-term use. Non drug treatments such as psychological intervention, cognitive-behavioral therapy, music therapy, exercise therapy, massage and relaxation therapy have fewer side effects and costs, and are beneficial in the long term, which will become the main treatment method for these symptoms in the future. Integrating sleep management into cancer treatment regimens and incorporating routine screening for sleep disorders into standard processes of cancer care can significantly improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment and the quality of life of patients with cancer, it is essential not only for personal health, but also for clinical practice and public health.\nWhile there is compelling data on the interplay between cancer and sleep disorders involving aspects of the circadian rhythm, nervous system, endocrine system, immune system, inflammatory response, and DNA. However, prospective studies of these complications in cancer survivors have been limited, with time and ethnicity limitations, and findings have been mostly exploratory rather than explanatory. Based on the history of tumor and sleep disorders in recent 20 years, the clinical treatment of tumor-induced sleep disorders and their direct bidirectional mechanisms may be a new focus of future research. The study of intrinsic mechanisms will help to reduce the occurrence of such complications at source, which is both a challenge and an opportunity for researchers. Future research can consider utilizing information from big data platforms, combined with genomics and metabolomics, to gain a deeper understanding of the potential mechanisms of cancer and sleep disorders and develop new treatment strategies to benefit patients with cancer and improve their quality of life and survival rate.", "content_for_embedding": "Cancer ranks as the leading cause of mortality globally, second only to heart disease, and is the leading cause of death in Southeast Asia (\nTo identify studies exploring potential links between sleep disorders and cancer, we searched PubMed and Web of Science databases covering the last 10 years of studies published up to August 28, 2024, with no restrictions on study type or geographic boundaries to enhance the comprehensiveness of the literature search.

Cancer seems to cause sleep disorders, which, in turn, contribute to the development and progression of cancer (\nRecent research reports suggest that individuals with sleep difficulties or diagnosed with sleep disorders at any point in their lives are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer (\nAnother prevalent sleep issue among patients with cancer is OSAS. OSAS is a very common sleep breathing disorder, but it is severely underestimated in clinical practice. The pathophysiological processes related to OSAS, such as fragmented sleep and intermittent hypoxia, may affect normal neuroendocrine regulation and impair the body’s immune function (\nSleep disturbances can encourage cancer cells to proliferate and migrate. It is likely that sleep disorders-induced circadian rhythm disturbances, decreased melatonin secretion, and inflammatory responses result in unregulated cell proliferation. Circadian disruptions can influence the expression of genes linked to tumor development and metastasis, DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (\nSeveral studies have reported a 3.4-to 4.8-fold increase in mortality in patients with cancer having OSAS (\nEpidemiological statistics indicate a correlation between anxiety and depression and a higher likelihood of sleep problems. Conversely, those who already have sleep disorders typically exhibit greater symptoms of anxiety and despair; There may be a vicious circle between the two. A substantial amount of evidence indicate that sleep disorders are independent risk factors for depression in healthy individuals and older individuals (\nA direct link between sleep disorders and memory problems in humans and animals has been often shown (\nResearch has found that sleep problems in cancer patients are associated with lower clinical prognosis and quality of life (\nExcessive daytime sleepiness and sleep disturbance impact fatigue and its perception. Sleep disorders are thought to be a cause of cancer-related fatigue and often accompany cancer-related fatigue (\nPatients with cancer frequently experience sleep disorders; therefore, prevention or treatment of sleep disorders, especially in the early stages of personalized treatment, can help reduce cancer-related pain, fatigue, and mental health issues like anxiety and depression. It is also possible to prevent the development, preservation, and/or deterioration of cancer, which can improve quality of life and survival rate of patients with cancer.\nPharmacological methods are among the most popular choices for treating sleep disturbances in cancer survivors, particularly in their acute stage. This is like the general population with sleep disorders. Common pharmacologic therapies include symptomatic medications (such as pain, diarrhea, and cough relief) and the use of benzodiazepine-based and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, as proposed by Pillai et al. (\nAlthough drug therapy has been widely attempted and considered beneficial for sleep, guidelines are still recommended for its short-term use (2–4 weeks), combined with long-term lifestyle changes and immediate management. Drugs cannot reconstruct normal sleep structures while improving sleep quality. Generally, it is helpful for any form of insomnia in the short term. If taken for too long, sleep regulation will be externalized, and once stopped, it is likely to rebound. In addition, long-term use of hypnotic drugs can lead to cognitive deterioration, increased fall and fracture rates (\nPatients with cancer frequently experience chronic sleep disturbance, and nonpharmacologic therapy may be helpful since it reduces the possible negative effects of long-term drug use. Common methods include CBT, exercise, massage, and relaxation therapy and improve the patient’s sleep environment.\nStudies have shown that CBT provides lasting improvement in insomnia, and the American College of Physicians recommends CBT-I as a first-line treatment (\nExercise, which includes yoga, walking, and other non-pharmacological treatments, is thought to help patients with cancer sleep better. It has also been demonstrated to lessen fatigue in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy (\nMassage and relaxation therapy is also one of the non-drug treatment methods. A recent study found that acupuncture and massage can help relieve pain in patients with advanced cancer, improve fatigue, insomnia and quality of life (\nRecent evidence suggests that PBM, and specifically intravascular laser blood irradiation (ILIB), can significantly improve insomnia (\nThe sleep environment is also crucial to improving sleep quality, especially during hospitalization. The two most common things that disrupt sleep are light and noise. A well-established sleeping environment is dark, quiet, and comfortable, which can effectively promote sleep quality. The common interventions include earplugs and eye masks. These can filter out light and noise, lengthen and deepen sleep, lower pain thresholds, and lessen the frequency of nighttime awakenings (\nIn the past few years, music therapy has received great attention in patients with sleep disorders and depression due to its non-invasive nature and minimal side effects. It improves sleep by regulating cortisol, releasing dopamine, and soothing autonomic nervous system (\nGood sleep helps patients with cancer have a better prognosis and quality of life, so addressing their sleep issues at the time of diagnosis, throughout therapy, and after treatment is crucial. The sleep scale should be used regularly by clinicians to evaluate patients’ sleep while screening for possible sleep disorders, such as prolonged sleep latency, frequent wakefulness and decreased sleep efficiency, fatigue, and drowsiness during the day, loud snoring, inappropriate behavior at night, and/or nightmares. It is worth noting that anxiety and depression in patients with cancer are important factors contributing to sleep disorders, and managing anxiety and depression seems to be necessary and should be the target of intervention. At present, the common treatments for anxiety and depression include antidepressant medication, psychological intervention, music therapy, recall therapy, CBT, and electronic health intervention. In addition, breathing problems during sleep should also be taken into account. For example, patients with lung cancer may experience inadequate ventilation during sleep (\nEndogenous cycles in physiology, hormones, and behavioral processes known as circadian rhythms regulate physiological and behavioral activities of each organ to maintain systemic homeostasis. Several key biological processes are regulated by circadian rhythms, including the sleep-wake cycle, food-fast cycle, and activity-rest cycle. Among them, the sleep-wake cycle is most likely the most well-known biological process that adheres to a 24-hour circadian rhythm (\nAlterations in the circadian rhythm lead to many kinds of diseases. Chronic sleep deprivation or excessive sleep, subhealthy lifestyle, shift work, and exposure to artificial and blue light at night have blurred the lines between day and night and raised the likelihood of disrupted circadian rhythms. The disruption of central and peripheral clocks, which causes extensive dysregulation of clock biological processes, ultimately leading to several diseases, such as obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and mental and neurological disorders.\nOn the other hand, the Circadian clock is essential for cell cycle regulation, and changes in clock function can lead to abnormal proliferation, growth, and DNA damage in cancer cells (\nThe hypothalamus is an essential component of the brain consisting of multiple nuclei that create and preserve systemic physiological equilibrium. It is critical for regulating sleep/wake behavior, body temperature, sexual behavior, appetite and completion stages of eating, system energy balance, and circadian rhythms (\nOn the other hand, dual-receptor antagonism promoted deep restorative sleep in tumor-bearing mice, which reduced the HO signal. The aberrant activity of these neuronal populations could be attributed to sleep disruption due to altered immunological, metabolic, or endocrine functioning caused by cancer. McAlpine and colleagues have shown that long, scattered sleep dramatically reduces the number of HO neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, a phenotype associated with arteriosclerosis development. Sleep and memory disorders in patients with cancer may be exacerbated by the dysfunction of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-promoting neurons, which are susceptible to peripheral inputs that become unregulated (\nFunctional alterations of the HPA axis are a common phenomenon in patients with cancer, characterized mainly by elevated corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secretion adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH), which leads to abnormally high levels of glucocorticoid and catecholamine. Elevated cortisol can suppress the body’s immune function. According to a large number of studies, dysfunction of the HPA axis in cancer patients, such as pituitary tumors, neurosurgery and radiation therapy of the tumor, can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders (\nTumors modify the activity of cells in both their immediate and distant environments to avoid detection by the immune system and meet the metabolic needs for growth, multiplication, and metastasis. These cells include T cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages in the liver and brain (\nAdequate sleep is crucial for maintaining strong immune function, which plays a key role in cancer prevention through mechanisms such as immune surveillance (\nSleep disorders, immune system, and inflammation. The normal sleep cycle maintains the normal function of the immune system by regulating the balance of the expression of cytokines, which is beneficial to the transfer of antigens. Chronic sleep disorders disrupt the circadian rhythm, affecting the normal function of the immune system, leading to inflammatory reactions in the body, including systemic inflammation, cellular inflammation, and inflammatory transcriptional activity, ultimately leading to chronic diseases such as cancer and depression.\nSleep disturbances affect DNA damage and repair. Sleep deprivation lowers melatonin levels, which increases oxidative damage of the DNA (\nSleep disorders, DNA damage and repair. Sleep disorders lead to the occurrence of cancers. On the one hand, sleep disorders can lower melatonin levels, which are important antioxidants that may lead to increased DNA oxidative damage. On the other hand, sleep disorders downregulate the expression of genes involved in DNA repair, such as ERCC6, PARP1 and RAD50.\nOther less clear mechanisms include changes in blood glucose levels, amino acid concentrations, and pH levels. So far, the link between sleep cancer and depression is not fully elucidated, and more research is needed.\nPeople with cancer often experience sleep disorders after cancer treatment, but they are often underestimated in practice. Sleep disorders symptom often overlap with cancer pain or physical fatigue and is difficult to differentiate, in addition to the accuracy of screening tools, the diversity of cancer types and treatment modalities. All this makes current research on sleep disorders in patients with cancer challenging. Based on the literature, the causes of the symptom in patients with cancer is not only related to physical pain, digestive tract reaction, fatigue, nervous system changes caused by primary cancer and treatment methods, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, gender, age, primary disease, marital status, the levels of education and economic, and social support all contribute to the occurrence of sleep disorders in patients with cancer. Similarly, the development of the symptom in turn increases the incidence of cancer, affects cognition and memory, reduces quality of life, and ultimately reduces the survival rate of patients with cancer. Current research suggests that sleep disorders may be an early signal of cancer, and as sleep problems are modifiable lifestyle factors, early screening and intervention for sleep disorders may provide unique intervention targets for cancer prevention. Future research should focus on reducing risk factors for sleep disorders in patients with cancer, establishing standardized assessment tools to measure sleep disorders, providing regular monitoring, early identification, and effective management, and evaluating the long-term benefits of sleep interventions in cancer prevention and treatment. At present, drug therapy is still the main treatment for sleep disorders in patients with cancer. However, research has shown that drug therapy has many side effects and is more suitable for short-term use. Non drug treatments such as psychological intervention, cognitive-behavioral therapy, music therapy, exercise therapy, massage and relaxation therapy have fewer side effects and costs, and are beneficial in the long term, which will become the main treatment method for these symptoms in the future. Integrating sleep management into cancer treatment regimens and incorporating routine screening for sleep disorders into standard processes of cancer care can significantly improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment and the quality of life of patients with cancer, it is essential not only for personal health, but also for clinical practice and public health.\nWhile there is compelling data on the interplay between cancer and sleep disorders involving aspects of the circadian rhythm, nervous system, endocrine system, immune system, inflammatory response, and DNA. However, prospective studies of these complications in cancer survivors have been limited, with time and ethnicity limitations, and findings have been mostly exploratory rather than explanatory. Based on the history of tumor and sleep disorders in recent 20 years, the clinical treatment of tumor-induced sleep disorders and their direct bidirectional mechanisms may be a new focus of future research. The study of intrinsic mechanisms will help to reduce the occurrence of such complications at source, which is both a challenge and an opportunity for researchers. Future research can consider utilizing information from big data platforms, combined with genomics and metabolomics, to gain a deeper understanding of the potential mechanisms of cancer and sleep disorders and develop new treatment strategies to benefit patients with cancer and improve their quality of life and survival rate.", "topic": "Sleep_disorder"}

It is often accompanied by symptoms such as snoring, sleep interruption, and hypoxemia, which can lead to a series of pathophysiological changes. These changes significantly increase the risk of various systemic diseases such as hypertension, stroke, and cardiovascular events [\nContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is one of the main methods for treating OSAS. This method can effectively reduce the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and respiratory disturbance index (RDI), and improve the patient’s sleep quality and daytime sleepiness symptoms [\nHowever, during CPAP therapy, two physical factors, including the mechanical pressure exerted by the mask on the face (particularly the meibomian gland area) and the retrograde flow of pressurized air through the nasolacrimal duct, may act synergistically on ocular tissues [\nPatients with OSAS who visited our hospital from January 2022 to December 2023 were selected as study subjects. Inclusion criteria: ① Meet the diagnostic criteria for OSAS [\n\nFlow chart of patient inclusion\n(1) CPAP therapy: All patients included in the study were OSAS patients receiving CPAP therapy for the first time and had not used CPAP devices prior to treatment. All patients underwent a one-week CPAP adaptation therapy (pressure 8–12 cmH₂O) prior to PSG monitoring to ensure mask compliance. The types of CPAP masks used in the study included nasal masks (ResMed AirFit N20, 74.2%) and oronasal mask masks (ResMed AirFit F20, 25.8%), both made of silicone. Leakage data were recorded in real-time using the device’s built-in sensor (ResMed S10 AutoSet).\n(2) Data collection: Demographic data such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar, and severity of OSAS were collected from all patients. Patients were divided into three groups based on the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI): mild (5–14.9 times/h, mean AHI ± SD, 10.35 ± 2.94), moderate (15–29.9 times/h, mean AHI ± SD, 22.48 ± 4.57), and severe (≥ 30 times/h, mean AHI ± SD, 40.83 ± 9.57).\n(3) Polysomnography (PSG) results: Before treatment and the day after treatment, polysomnography (Beijing Yihe Jiaye, Poly Pro YH-2000 A) was used to monitor AHI (normal range: 0–5 times/h) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO\n(4) Dry eye condition: The breakup time (BUT), Schirmer I test (Sit), palpebral (PL), and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) were observed before and after treatment.\n①BUT: A 0.125% sodium fluorescein solution was applied to the conjunctival sac, and the patient was asked to blink several times to evenly distribute the sodium fluorescein on the corneal and conjunctival surfaces. Then, the patient was asked to keep eyes open while a slit-lamp microscope with cobalt blue light was used to observe the corneal surface, and the time from the last blink to the appearance of the first dry spot was recorded. Normal tear film break-up time is over 10 s; less than 10 s indicates tear film instability, with abnormal values below 8 s indicating significant instability, and values below 4 s suggesting severe dry eye.\n②Sit: There are two ways of testing, including the active and passive tear secretion test. The active detection method was to place a filter paper strip on the lower meibomian gland margin for 5 min, and the wetted length was measured. Normal secretion is 10–15 mm; less than 10 mm indicates low secretion, and less than 5 mm suggests dry eye. In passive secretion testing, the strip was placed in the conjunctival sac for about 5 min with closed eyes. Tear secretion below 10 mm indicates low secretion, and repeated measures below 5 mm may diagnose dry eye.\n③PL: Fluorescein staining was used to divide the cornea into four quadrants, with each quadrant scored from 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicates no staining; 1 indicates 1–30 punctate stains; 2 indicates more than 30 punctate stains but no coalescence; and 3 indicates coalescence, filaments, or ulcers.\n④OSDI: The OSDI questionnaire consists of 12 items, divided into three subscales: ocular symptoms, vision-related functions, and environmental triggers. Patients score each item on a scale of 0 (never) to 4 (always), with the total OSDI score calculated as: OSDI = (total score of answered questions × 100) / (total number of questions answered × 4). Based on the total score, OSDI scores are classified as normal (0–12), mild dry eye (13–22), moderate dry eye (23–32), or severe dry eye (33 or above).\n(5) Ocular surface analyzer results.\nThe tear meniscus height, lipid layer thickness, eye redness index and meibomian gland opening score were evaluated by ocular surface comprehensive analyzer (Keratograph 5 M).\n① Tear meniscus height: An ocular surface comprehensive analyzer (e.g., Keratograph 5 M) was used to take the image of the concave arc formed at the junction of the tear and the meibomian gland margin, and indirectly evaluated the tear secretion by measuring the tear retention height. A normal tear meniscus height is ≥ 0.2 mm, with lower values indicating reduced tear secretion.\n② Lipid layer thickness: Assessed using an ocular surface interferometer (e.g., Lipi -View). A normal lipid layer thickness is greater than 100 nm. Thicknesses between 61 and 100 nm suggest a 50% likelihood of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), while values of ≤ 60 nm indicate a 90% likelihood of MGD.\n③ Eye Redness Index: The eye redness index was measured by a non-invasive ocular surface comprehensive analyzer (e.g., Keratograph 5 M), which evaluates the redness of the eyes by analyzing the degree of conjunctival congestion. While specific scoring criteria were not found in the referenced data, the index typically classifies redness severity by analyzing the degree of congestion.\n④ Meibomian gland opening score: Meibomian gland opening score was assessed by observing the condition of the meibomian gland openings. The method involved having the patient look upward, and then examining and grading the opening condition of the 8 meibomian glands located in the central third of the lower meibomian gland. The scoring system is as follows: 0 points for normal gland openings (rounded, with no blockages); 1 point for openings with lipid capping; and 2 points for blocked or narrowed openings with protruding lipid plugs.\nAnalysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 software. All measurement data were first subjected to the Shapiro–Wilk normality test (\nA total of 31 OSAS patients were included in the study, with 21 males and 10 females. The average BMI of the patients was (26.71 ± 4.33) kg/m², which exceeds the normal range and falls within the overweight category. Blood pressure analysis showed that the average systolic pressure was (131.23 ± 12.50) mmHg, slightly above the normal range, while the average diastolic pressure was (75.50 ± 10.23) mmHg. The severity of the patients’ conditions was as follows: 8 cases (25.81%) had mild OSAS, 11 cases (35.48%) had moderate OSAS, and 12 cases (38.71%) had severe OSAS. Additional general information is provided in Table\n\nGeneral information of OSAS patients\nTo further analyze the PSG results of OSAS patients before and after CPAP treatment, this study conducted PSG testing on 31 OSAS patients before treatment and the day after treatment to assess AHI and SpO\nTo further analyze changes in dry eye conditions among OSAS patients after CPAP treatment, 31 patients were assessed both before treatment and a day after treatment.

According to existing studies [\nThe results of Pearson correlation analysis showed that BUT was positively correlated with lipid layer thickness and improvement of eye redness, Sit was positively correlated with tear meniscus height, PL score was negatively correlated with tear meniscus height, and positively correlated with eye redness index. Meibomian gland dysfunction is one of the common causes of dry eye, and the morphological structure and function of meibomian glands in OSAS patients also changed significantly. Studies have shown that [\nIn summary, when OSAS patients use CPAP masks for treatment, it may have a negative impact on dry eye symptoms and meibomian gland function, leading to decreased tear film stability and aggravated symptoms such as dry eyes. This study has a relatively small sample size, and the results may have certain biases. The study period is short, and the long-term effects of mask usage on dry eye symptoms and meibomian gland function remain unclear. Insufficient comparisons among different types of masks may overlook more effective treatment options. Future research could expand the sample size and lengthen the study period to conduct a more comprehensive comparison of different types of masks, aiming to provide more effective treatment strategies for OSAS patients. Moreover, exploring other adjunctive therapies, such as pharmacological or physical treatments, could further enhance treatment efficacy.", "content_for_embedding": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a disease caused by repeated collapse of the upper airway during sleep.

The meibomian gland opening score did not change before and after treatment, indicating that CPAP treatment can improve the lipid layer thickness and eye redness index of OSAS patients, but has no effect on the meibomian gland opening score. According to existing studies [\nThe results of Pearson correlation analysis showed that BUT was positively correlated with lipid layer thickness and improvement of eye redness, Sit was positively correlated with tear meniscus height, PL score was negatively correlated with tear meniscus height, and positively correlated with eye redness index. Meibomian gland dysfunction is one of the common causes of dry eye, and the morphological structure and function of meibomian glands in OSAS patients also changed significantly. Studies have shown that [\nIn summary, when OSAS patients use CPAP masks for treatment, it may have a negative impact on dry eye symptoms and meibomian gland function, leading to decreased tear film stability and aggravated symptoms such as dry eyes. This study has a relatively small sample size, and the results may have certain biases. The study period is short, and the long-term effects of mask usage on dry eye symptoms and meibomian gland function remain unclear. Insufficient comparisons among different types of masks may overlook more effective treatment options. Future research could expand the sample size and lengthen the study period to conduct a more comprehensive comparison of different types of masks, aiming to provide more effective treatment strategies for OSAS patients. Moreover, exploring other adjunctive therapies, such as pharmacological or physical treatments, could further enhance treatment efficacy.", "topic": "Sleep_disorder"}

However, in many studies around the world, Cys-C has been established as a critical factor in the prediction of cardiovascular risk and mortality.\nMedian follow-up of 42 months was short, and endpoint events may not have fully occurred.\nObstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is a sleep breathing disorder with sleep snoring, apnoea and daytime sleepiness as the main clinical manifestations. The disease causes intermittent hypoxia, hypercapnia and sleep structure disorders and leads to hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), arrhythmia, cerebrovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, type 2 diabetes and other multiorgan and multisystem damage.\nAt present, most studies have also confirmed the bidirectional relationship between OSAS and chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is a chronic progressive destruction of kidney structure and function caused by various factors. It is characterised by a high prevalence rate, low awareness rate, poor prognosis and high medical costs. In recent years, with the increasing age of the world population, the morbidity and mortality associated with CKD are increasing each year, which has become a global public health problem. According to cross-sectional epidemiological studies in China, CKD was prevalent in 10.8% of the population above 18 years of age.\nSleep disturbances were significantly correlated with an elevated all-cause mortality rate among patients with CKD.

Clinical data were collected from patients with OSAS diagnosed using polysomnography (PSG). The study followed the guidelines for reporting cohort studies (\nWe recruited 1290 elderly patients diagnosed for the first time with OSAS using PSG from January 2015 to October 2017 at the Sleep Center/Department of the General Hospital of the People’s Liberation Army (313), Peking University International Hospital (238), Peking University People’s Hospital (242), Beijing Chaoyang Hospital (337), the 960th Hospital of the People’s Liberation Army (48) and the Affiliated Hospital of Gansu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (112).

First, we calculated GFR based on Cys-C to determine renal function, which may be skewed. However, Cys-C has been proven to be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk and mortality in numerous studies around the world. Second, as Cys-C was only a baseline study, we did not yet know how renal function was related to adverse outcomes. Third, the median follow-up time was 42 months, which was short, and the endpoint events may not have fully occurred. Longer follow-ups are required in future studies.

An apnoea was defined as a decrease in airflow of more than 90% for at least 10 s, and a hypopnoea was defined as a decrease in oxygen saturation of 3% followed by a decrease in airflow of greater than 30% for at least 10 s.\nThe sleep Apnoea Hypopnoea Index (AHI) was defined as the number of apnoea and hypopnoea events per hour during sleep. According to AHI, the severity of OSAS was classified as follows: none/min: AHI<5 times/hour; mild: 5 times/hour ≤AHI<15 times/hour; moderate: 15 times/hour ≤AHI<30 times/hour; severe: AHI≥30 times/hour.\nWe obtained clinical data from hospital medical databases for all subjects, including demographic data such as sex, age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), neck circumference (NC), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC) and self-reported history of smoking and alcohol consumption. Data on complications included occurrence of hypertension, carotid atherosclerosis, diabetes, CHD, cerebrovascular disease, gastro-oesophageal reflux and laboratory data such as levels of uric acid, urea, creatinine (Cr), fasting blood glucose, white blood cell count (WBC), etc were also obtained. Sleep parameters such as AHI, total sleep time, Oxygen Reduction Index (ODI), duration of SaO\nBMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height (m\nThe eGFR in this study was based on Cys-C. The calculation formula was as follows: eGFR=133×(Scys/0.8)\nBased on the criteria set out in the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Assessment and Management of CKD by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes in 2012,\nWe monitored 1076 patients with OSAS starting from the point of diagnosis via PSG assessment until December 2020, and at intervals of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and subsequently every 6 months (at a minimum of 3 months and up to 1 year). The outcomes of the participants were primarily gathered by telephone, outpatient visits or case reviews conducted by two professionally trained investigators who were oblivious to the patients’ PSG results. Information regarding all-cause mortality, inclusive of cardiovascular death, was collected from the date of participation until December 2020. All patients received standard medical care throughout a median follow-up period of 42 months, in accordance with their disease status. All clinical events were confirmed by the original documentation and adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee.\nAccording to literature reports, the incidence of renal insufficiency in patients with varying degrees of OSAS ranges from 7% to 31%.\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS V.25.0 software. Measurement data conforming to normal distribution were expressed as mean±SD, and one-way analysis of variance was used for comparison between groups. Continuous variables of skewed distribution were expressed as median (P25–P75), and non-parametric tests were used for comparison between groups. Count data were expressed as relative numbers, and comparison between groups was performed using χ\nThere was no patient and/or public involvement in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination of this study.\nBased on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study, 1076 elderly patients with OSAS were included (\nCompared with Group 1, p<0.05.\nCompared with Group 2, p<0.05.\nCompared with Group 3, p<0.05.\nCompared with Group 4, p<0.05.\nAHI, Apnoea Hypopnoea Index; ALT, alanine transaminase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; BMI, body mass index; CHD, coronary heart disease; Cr, creatinine; CRP, C-reactive protein; Cys-C, cystatin C; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; Glu, glucose; Hb, haemoglobin; HC, hip circumference; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; LAT, the longest apnoea time; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; LSpO\nDuring a median follow-up of 42 months (range 1–72 months), 50 patients (4.6%) died (mainly including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for unstable angina, heart failure or stroke), of which 24 patients (2.2%) had cardiovascular death. As eGFR concentration decreased, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality increased (p<0.001, p<0.01) (\nDuring a median follow-up of 42 months, Kaplan-Meier plots were used to analyse the cumulative survival of all-cause death and cardiovascular death based on eGFR values (\nNext, we performed a univariate analysis showing that SBP, hypertension, carotid atherosclerosis, diabetes, CHD, cerebrovascular disease, Cr and eGFR were associated with all-cause mortality (\nHRs with 95% CIs from cox analysis.\nCHD, coronary heart disease; Cr, creatinine; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\nHRs with 95% CIs from cox analysis.\nCHD, coronary heart disease; Cr, creatinine; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\nFurthermore, multivariate analysis showed that patients in eGFR Group 4 had a 4.16-fold higher risk of death than patients in Group 1 (HR=4.163, 95% CI, 1.524 to 11.375; p=0.005), and eGFR Group 4 patients had an 8.95-fold higher risk of cardiovascular death than patients in Group 1 (HR=8.954, 95% CI, 2.108 to 38.033; p=0.003,\nCardiovascular death: adjusted for the SBP, carotid atherosclerosis, CHD, cerebrovascular disease, Cr and eGFR.\nDeath: adjusted for the SBP, hypertension, carotid atherosclerosis, diabetes, CHD, cerebrovascular disease, Cr and eGFR.\nCHD, coronary heart disease; Cr, creatinine; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\nTo our knowledge, this was the first large study to assess CKD and mortality risk events in elderly patients with OSAS based on eGFR. In our study, elderly patients with OSAS with eGFR<30 mL/min/1.73 m\nGFR is one of the indicators of kidney function and is used to evaluate the filtration function of the kidney, which is crucial for the diagnosis, staging and prognosis of CKD.\nIn our median follow-up period of 42 months, 4.6% of patients died, of which 2.2% died of cardiovascular causes. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with eGFR<30 mL/min/1.73 m\nStudies have confirmed that OSAS can decrease kidney function, and end-stage renal disease can also worsen OSAS, both of which have a two-way relationship.\nAn advantage of this study was its large multicentre prospective cohort design. The raw data was collected at each centre by clinicians, and the cases were complete. There were, however, some limitations to our study. First, we calculated GFR based on Cys-C to determine renal function, which may be skewed. However, Cys-C has been proven to be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk and mortality in numerous studies around the world. Second, as Cys-C was only a baseline study, we did not yet know how renal function was related to adverse outcomes. Third, the median follow-up time was 42 months, which was short, and the endpoint events may not have fully occurred. Longer follow-ups are required in future studies. Despite these limitations, our research still had value.\nIn summary, our GFR estimated based on Cys-C suggested that elderly patients with OSAS with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m", "topic": "Sleep_disorder"}

Selected IMFs then undergo Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to generate the time-frequency spectrum. We then measure instantaneous time-frequency features—including maximum instantaneous frequency and maximum frequency amplitude—along with IMF energy characteristics to create distinguishing spectral parameters. Finally, we test these quantitative features’ effectiveness in separating healthy subjects from sleep apnea patients using three machine learning classifiers.\nThis study employed ECG data from the PhysioNet Apnea-ECG Database (\nTo minimize borderline cases’ influence, we excluded Group B and focused on 120 recordings (60 from Group A and 60 from Group C), comprising approximately 57,600 1-min segments.

These components retain some high-frequency noise, making quantitative feature extraction challenging.\nIn contrast, IMF7 demonstrates the most pronounced intergroup differences. OSA patients show significantly stronger frequency energy concentrations compared to healthy subjects at corresponding time points. This observation suggests that IMF7 captures sleep apnea-related frequency variations, consistent with known physiological effects of hypoxia and sleep disruption on cardiac activity and ECG signal characteristics (\nTo further quantify the differences in two-dimensional time-frequency maps between healthy individuals and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, we selected 45 signal sets from healthy subjects in Dataset C and 40 signal sets from apnea patients in Dataset A.

Furthermore, the f\nThis physiological distinction may be explained by the effects of sleep apnea on oxygenation. During apneic episodes, inadequate oxygen supply to the brain and peripheral tissues results in systemic hypoxia, including diminished cardiac oxygenation. In response, the brain initiates compensatory mechanisms such as transient respiratory pulses to elevate breathing frequency, as documented in reference (\nTo assess the diagnostic potential of these features, we implemented a random forest algorithm with stratified 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate classification performance using three distinct feature combinations: IMF5 quantized features with reconstructed signal f\nAs demonstrated in\nComparison of classification results performance and related work.\nAcc, accuracy; Sen, Sensitivity; Spe, specificit.

Bold values indicate optimal results within each column.\nThe spectral features extracted from ECG signals in this study offer two significant advantages for OSA detection. First, the time-frequency analysis provides clear physiological interpretation of how OSA affects ECG signals while eliminating irrelevant features. Second, the focused approach on key discriminative components such as IMF7 and femax effectively reduces feature dimensionality. This optimization minimizes the negative impact of excessive features on machine learning performance while maintaining excellent adaptability across different classification algorithms.\nThis study identifies four IMF components as characteristic elements of the signal through frequency-domain analysis, specifically using the f\nBuilding on this, we applied the HHT to derive a two-dimensional time-frequency spectrum of the IMF7 component. This approach provides a more precise representation of the distinctions between normal individuals and sleep apnea patients in the time-frequency domain, clearly showing the impact of sleep apnea on cardiopulmonary activity.

This step removes low- and high-frequency noise along with baseline drift, producing a clean ECG signal for further analysis.\nNext, the preprocessed ECG signal is decomposed via EEMD to extract intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Selected IMFs then undergo Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to generate the time-frequency spectrum. We then measure instantaneous time-frequency features—including maximum instantaneous frequency and maximum frequency amplitude—along with IMF energy characteristics to create distinguishing spectral parameters. Finally, we test these quantitative features’ effectiveness in separating healthy subjects from sleep apnea patients using three machine learning classifiers.\nThis study employed ECG data from the PhysioNet Apnea-ECG Database (\nTo minimize borderline cases’ influence, we excluded Group B and focused on 120 recordings (60 from Group A and 60 from Group C), comprising approximately 57,600 1-min segments. The segment distribution showed distinct patterns: Group A contained an A:N ratio of ≈1.8:1 (apnea-dominant), while Group C showed ≈1:19.3 (normal-dominant). The dataset was randomly partitioned at the recording level into training (84 recordings, 40,320 segments) and testing sets (36 recordings, 17,280 segments) in a 7:3 ratio, strictly preserving the original apnea-normal proportion characteristics in both subsets.\nThe acquisition of ECG signals is frequently contaminated by multiple noise sources, which can be categorized as: Low-frequency baseline wander (0–0.5 Hz), Broadband electromyographic interference (5–2000 Hz), Narrowband power line interference (>50 Hz) (\nTo address this limitation, we employ Independent Component Analysis (ICA), which exploits the statistical independence and non-Gaussian characteristics of source signals to achieve superior noise separation (\nComparison before and after denoising.\nHHT transform is a Time–frequency analysis method with strong adaptability (\n(1) Add i-fold Gaussian white noise\n(2) Using EMD to decompose the new signal\n(3) The influence of white noise can be eliminated by averaging the\nThen, select the component IMF with the intrinsic characteristics of ECG signal to conduct Hilbert transform (HT) to obtain the corresponding Spectrogram diagram, also known as Hilbert spectrum (\n(4) The definition expression of HHT is given by\nIn the formula:\n(5) Construct the analytic signal (\n(6) Differential the phase of the complex function to obtain the Instantaneous phase and frequency\n(7) Display the Instantaneous phase and frequency on the time-frequency plane to obtain the formula spectrum\n(8) Spectrum\nThe marginal spectrum can reflect the energy distribution of each frequency.\nThe two-dimensional Spectrogram transformation process of ECG signals in this study is shown in\nTime frequency conversion diagram of electrocardiogram signal.\nFirst, the denoised signal is decomposed to extract the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of the original signal. Highly correlated IMFs are selected through Pearson correlation analysis and subsequently reconstructed to obtain the refined signal.

Specifically, we utilized the Signal Processing Toolbox for EEMD and Hilbert transform computations, and the Machine Learning Toolbox for classification tasks.\n\nIMF5∼IMF7 Component of Hilbert Spectra.\nAnalysis of energy distribution across frequency bands reveals that while IMF5 and IMF6 components fall within the reconstructed signal’s maximum instantaneous phase and frequency range, their energy distributions exhibit considerable similarity. These components retain some high-frequency noise, making quantitative feature extraction challenging.\nIn contrast, IMF7 demonstrates the most pronounced intergroup differences. OSA patients show significantly stronger frequency energy concentrations compared to healthy subjects at corresponding time points. This observation suggests that IMF7 captures sleep apnea-related frequency variations, consistent with known physiological effects of hypoxia and sleep disruption on cardiac activity and ECG signal characteristics (\nTo further quantify the differences in two-dimensional time-frequency maps between healthy individuals and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, we selected 45 signal sets from healthy subjects in Dataset C and 40 signal sets from apnea patients in Dataset A. The marginal spectra of the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components IMF5 to IMF7 were computed using the Hilbert transform (HT), as illustrated in\nComparison of marginal spectra between healthy individuals and OSA.\nPanels (a), (b), and (c) in the figure display the marginal spectra of IMF5, IMF6, and IMF7 for healthy individuals and OSA patients, respectively. Distinct differences in both the shape and amplitude of the marginal spectra were observed between the two groups. To further investigate these spectral differences, we analyzed the following parameters derived from the marginal spectrum in the frequency domain: Maximum instantaneous frequency, Maximum instantaneous amplitude (V), and Characteristic energy (S) (\nThe differences in three groups of indicators between healthy individuals and OSA patients were analyzed using independent sample t-test (SPSS, Windows version 14.0), and the analysis results are shown in\nHealthy population and characteristic parameters of OSA patients.\nValue expressed as mean ± standard deviation; *p < 0.05:OSA, differs from healthy individuals; **p < 0.001:OSA, has significant differences compared to healthy individuals; Exact p-values for all comparisons are provided in\nThe analysis presented in the table reveals that the quantitative parameters of IMF5 and IMF6 show no statistically significant differences between the two study populations. This observation aligns with the patterns observed in the time-frequency maps. In contrast, the IMF7 component exhibits marked differences in maximum instantaneous phase, frequency amplitude, and characteristic energy between groups. Furthermore, the f\nThis physiological distinction may be explained by the effects of sleep apnea on oxygenation. During apneic episodes, inadequate oxygen supply to the brain and peripheral tissues results in systemic hypoxia, including diminished cardiac oxygenation. In response, the brain initiates compensatory mechanisms such as transient respiratory pulses to elevate breathing frequency, as documented in reference (\nTo assess the diagnostic potential of these features, we implemented a random forest algorithm with stratified 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate classification performance using three distinct feature combinations: IMF5 quantized features with reconstructed signal f\nAs demonstrated in\nComparison of classification results performance and related work.\nAcc, accuracy; Sen, Sensitivity; Spe, specificit.

Bold values indicate optimal results within each column.\nThe spectral features extracted from ECG signals in this study offer two significant advantages for OSA detection. First, the time-frequency analysis provides clear physiological interpretation of how OSA affects ECG signals while eliminating irrelevant features. Second, the focused approach on key discriminative components such as IMF7 and femax effectively reduces feature dimensionality. This optimization minimizes the negative impact of excessive features on machine learning performance while maintaining excellent adaptability across different classification algorithms.\nThis study identifies four IMF components as characteristic elements of the signal through frequency-domain analysis, specifically using the f\nBuilding on this, we applied the HHT to derive a two-dimensional time-frequency spectrum of the IMF7 component. This approach provides a more precise representation of the distinctions between normal individuals and sleep apnea patients in the time-frequency domain, clearly showing the impact of sleep apnea on cardiopulmonary activity. However, since visual differences in spectral images are not quantifiable, we further extracted three feature indicators from this component for statistical analysis.\nOur findings reveal that the marginal spectral amplitude and the feature energy parameter S of the reconstructed signal (derived from f", "topic": "Sleep_disorder"}

We also highlight the emerging technologies and interdisciplinary trends that are poised to shape the future of RLS research and clinical management. By integrating recent discoveries with foundational knowledge, this review aims to provide a broad, yet critical resource for both clinicians and researchers in the field.\nRLS is a globally prevalent disorder with notable disparities observed across regions and populations. A systematic review and modeling analysis published in 2019 estimated the global prevalence of RLS among adults aged 20–79 years at 7.12%, corresponding to approximately 356.07 million affected individuals worldwide.\nDespite these comprehensive estimates, epidemiological studies in several regions remain underrepresented. In Asia, reported prevalence varies from 1.0% to 7.2%,\nThe prevalence varies significantly across demographic and clinical populations. For instance, during pregnancy, symptom onset frequently occurs in the third trimester.\nAlthough RLS has been observed across various age groups, its incidence varies significantly. Research indicates a notable prevalence among children and adolescents. For instance, a study conducted on students aged 10 to 19 years in Turkey revealed a definitive diagnosis rate of RLS of 2.74%, with a higher prevalence in females (3.42%) than in males (2.04%).\nThe elderly population is also at a heightened risk for RLS.\nResearch indicates a notable sex disparity in the prevalence of RLS, with a higher incidence observed in females, with numerous studies demonstrating that women are approximately twice as likely to develop RLS as men.\nAlthough the body of research on racial differences is limited, existing studies have suggested variability in the prevalence and clinical manifestations of RLS across different racial groups. A study involving 359 patients with RLS in China indicated that subjective experiences reported by patients differed from those documented in Western populations, with Chinese patients describing less pain, increased soreness, and a higher prevalence of iron deficiency, along with seasonal fluctuations and absence of anemia.\nRLS exhibits significant familial aggregation, with over 50% of affected individuals reporting a family history of the condition.\nHowever, the genetic underpinnings of RLS are complex and cannot be attributed to a straightforward single-gene inheritance model. GWAS has identified several genetic loci associated with an increased risk of RLS; however, these common variants account for only a minor portion of the overall disease risk.\nNumerous genes associated with RLS have been identified through GWAS, with MEIS1, BTBD9, and PTPRD recognized as the most significantly correlated candidate genes.\nBTBD9 has garnered considerable interest in the scientific community, with research indicating that knockout of this gene in murine models produces a phenotype analogous to RLS.\nThe prevalence of RLS is attributed to the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Various genetic variants that increase an individual’s susceptibility to RLS have been identified.\nMoreover, additional environmental factors, such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and sleep disorders, may interact with genetic predispositions.\nGWAS have identified several genetic regions that increase the risk of RLS, with MEIS1, BTBD9, and PTPRD being the most consistently reported in both European and Asian populations.\nBTBD9 is another key gene identified by GWAS that has been validated in both human and animal studies.\nDespite these findings, the known genetic variants account for only a small fraction of the overall genetic contribution to RLS (less than 10%).\nThe central nervous system (CNS) is an integral part of RLS pathophysiology. Numerous studies have identified various CNS abnormalities in individuals with RLS, including alterations in nerve excitability, neurotransmitter imbalances, and modifications to both brain structure and function.\nRegarding brain structure and function, iron deficiency has been observed in the brains of individuals with RLS, correlating with decreased myelination.\nDysfunction of the dopamine system is a significant hypothesis for the pathophysiology of RLS. Numerous studies have demonstrated that dopaminergic medications can alleviate RLS symptoms, whereas dopamine receptor antagonists tend to exacerbate these symptoms, indicating critical involvement of the dopamine system in RLS.\nFurther investigations have revealed alterations in dopamine transporter (DAT) levels in patients with RLS.\nIn addition to the dopamine system, imbalances in other neurotransmitters contribute to morbidity associated with RLS. Notably, disruption of glutamatergic neurotransmission has garnered significant attention.\nMoreover, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, is gaining recognition.\nThe pathophysiology of RLS is now increasingly understood as a result of complex interactions among multiple neurotransmitter systems rather than isolated dopaminergic dysfunction, with players in this neurochemical network including the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and adenosinergic systems, whose coordinated imbalance contributes to the heterogeneous manifestations of RLS.\nIron deficiency plays a central upstream role in neurotransmitter synthesis, transport, and synaptic regulation. As a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, iron is essential for dopamine synthesis, and its deficiency reduces dopamine production and DAT activity, thereby disrupting synaptic dopamine homeostasis.\nGABAergic pathways, which are essential for motor inhibition, may fail to counterbalance this excitatory drive.\nThis integrative framework highlights iron deficiency as a converging pathogenic factor that disrupts neurochemical balance across multiple axes. This also explains why monotherapies targeting a single neurotransmitter often yield incomplete symptom control, thereby supporting the rationale for multimodal therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring iron homeostasis and neurotransmitter equilibrium.\nThe diagnostic framework for RLS has undergone multiple revisions over the past few decades, paralleling advances in clinical characterization and mechanistic understanding. Early diagnostic efforts were largely based on subjective symptom reports with significant variability in terminology and clinical interpretation. A major milestone was achieved in 1995 when the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) introduced a formal set of diagnostic criteria aimed at standardizing clinical recognition.\nSubsequent revisions in 2003 and 2012 aimed to improve diagnostic specificity and reduce misclassification, particularly in the research context. The 2012 update reaffirmed the four essential criteria and added guidance for distinguishing RLS from clinical mimics, such as positional discomfort, myalgia, or peripheral neuropathy. To enhance diagnostic confidence, a set of supportive clinical features was introduced, including a positive family history, presence of PLMs during sleep, response to dopaminergic therapy, and absence of sensory deficits on neurological examination.\nThe diagnostic criteria for RLS have also been extended to pediatric populations, where symptom descriptions are often vague or behaviorally inferred.\nImaging modalities are crucial tools for diagnosing and understanding morbidity associated with RLS. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been extensively employed in research on RLS.\nfMRI studies have revealed functional abnormalities in the brain of patients with RLS. Research indicates that these individuals exhibit pathological activation across various regions of the sensorimotor and limbic networks, implying that these areas may significantly contribute to the morbidity of RLS by influencing the manifestation of sensory and motor symptoms as well as emotional regulation.\nThe identification of effective biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring of RLS is of paramount importance. Current research has investigated the potential of various biomarkers in the diagnosis of RLS. For instance, glycomic analysis conducted on serum samples from RLS patients identified 24 N-glycan biomarker candidates that exhibited significant differences when compared to control subjects, as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\nFurthermore, the neurofilament light chain (NfL) has emerged as a biomarker with diagnostic relevance in various neurological disorders. In the context of RLS, research has indicated that while serum levels of NfL did not show significant differences between RLS patients and control groups, nor were they significantly correlated with disease duration or severity, larger-scale studies are needed to further elucidate its role in RLS.\nPharmacological interventions for RLS are primarily focused on alleviating symptoms and enhancing the overall quality of life of the affected individuals. Currently, first-line therapeutic agents predominantly consist of dopamine receptor agonists and α2δ calcium channel ligands.\nIn recent years, the therapeutic potential of α2δ calcium channel ligands such as gabapentin and pregabalin has gained prominence in the treatment of RLS. Research indicates that these agents are effective in alleviating RLS symptoms and may offer superior safety and tolerability profiles compared to dopamine agonists.\nNonpharmacological interventions play a supportive role in the management of RLS, particularly for patients with mild symptoms, those intolerant to pharmacologic agents, and individuals seeking adjunctive treatments.\nIn addition, certain behavioral therapies, such as massage and warm water baths, have shown symptom-alleviating effects.\nFurthermore, neuromodulatory physical therapy modalities, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcutaneous direct current spinal cord stimulation (tsDCS), are being explored for their utility in RLS treatment.\nDespite encouraging findings, most nonpharmacological therapies remain in the exploratory phase. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate their efficacy, establish standardized protocols, and better define their role in integrated treatment strategies for RLS.\nOwing to variability in symptoms, severity, genetic predispositions, and treatment responses among patients with RLS, it is essential to investigate personalized treatment strategies. When formulating a treatment plan, comprehensive assessment of various patient-specific factors is necessary. For instance, in individuals with iron deficiency, iron replacement therapy may serve as a critical component of treatment, and iron supplementation can rectify abnormal iron metabolism and alleviate RLS symptoms in certain patients, indicating that iron-deficient patients with RLS often experience significant symptom relief after iron supplementation.\nMoreover, treatment customization based on the genetic profiles of patients has garnered increasing attention. Advances in the genetic understanding of RLS have revealed that certain genetic variations may influence patients’ responses to pharmacological interventions. For example, individuals with specific genetic variants may exhibit varying degrees of efficacy when treated with dopamine agonists.\nTCM operates within a unique theoretical framework that differs from the Western biomedical paradigms. Central to TCM is the concept of qi, which refers to the vital energy circulating through the meridians of the body and is essential for maintaining physiological balance.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on the Shaoyao Gancao Decoction indicated that this traditional formulation may help alleviate RLS symptoms; however, the overall quality of evidence was low, highlighting the need for further rigorous validation.\nTaking Shaoyao Gancao Decoction as a case study, some reports indicate that patients experienced significant relief from leg discomfort and improved sleep quality following its administration.\nTCM is generally regarded as a safe treatment option for RLS. Studies examining various TCM prescriptions for RLS have reported relatively fewer adverse reactions.\nRecent consensus guidelines published by the IRLSSG provide a structured algorithm for the pharmacological treatment of RLS, with an emphasis on risk stratification, iron status, and augmentation prevention.\nDopamine receptor agonists, including pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine, are effective for short-term symptom control, but are associated with a well-documented risk of augmentation.\nWhen augmentation occurs, management includes dose reduction, switching to α2δ ligands, or use of long-acting opioids in refractory cases.\nIron deficiency is a key factor that can be modified. IRLSSG and subsequent clinical studies recommend initiating iron replacement therapy when serum ferritin is <75 ng/mL and <100 ng/mL if symptoms are severe or refractory, respectively. Intravenous iron formulations, such as ferric carboxymaltose or iron sucrose, are preferred over oral iron for patients with gastrointestinal intolerance or insufficient response. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant symptom reduction with IV iron administration in patients with serum ferritin levels <75 ng/mL, supporting this approach.\nTaken together, these evidence-based strategies reinforce the importance of individualized therapy based on symptom severity, iron status, and risk of augmentation. Incorporating guideline-informed decision making may improve long-term outcomes and reduce adverse treatment effects.\nEmerging technologies present novel opportunities for investigating RLS. Recent studies have indicated that electronic stimulation may serve as a promising nonpharmacological intervention for RLS. A randomized, single-blind trial involving 46 patients with RLS assessed the efficacy of electronic stimulation (ES) by dividing the participants into active and sham stimulation groups. Utilizing a handheld ES device, the lower legs were stimulated bilaterally in a 3 Hz tapping pattern. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in symptom severity within the active group accompanied by a notable interaction between time and group. These findings suggest that ES may enhance symptom relief when applied at optimal stimulation intensities, positioning it as a potential non-pharmacological treatment alternative for RLS.\nNoninvasive high-frequency peroneal nerve stimulation (NPNS) offers an innovative approach for RLS management. Research involving 20 patients with moderate-to-severe RLS revealed that NPNS effectively alleviated symptoms by activating the leg muscles without disrupting sleep. This study indicated that NPNS could sustain tonic electromyographic (EMG) activity over time, with evoked EMG responses serving as predictors of treatment efficacy. Notably, improvements in the IRLS scores were more pronounced in patients with lower motor thresholds. Additionally, NPNS treatment frequently enhances patients’ self-reported sleep onset.\nResearch on RLS has demonstrated a notable interdisciplinary trend. Given that RLS encompasses various domains including neurology, psychology, and genetics, it is challenging to fully elucidate the mechanisms of morbidity and identify effective treatment modalities within a single discipline. For instance, integration of neuroscience and psychology can enhance our understanding of how psychosocial factors influence RLS. A qualitative analysis of 15 patients with RLS revealed that stigma associated with the loss of physical control and insufficient professional recognition contributed to psychological distress, underscoring the significance of psychosocial elements in the diagnosis and treatment of RLS as well as the necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration in patient care.\nFurthermore, epidemiological-genetic crossover studies utilizing extensive population studies and genetic analyses can provide more precise insights into the genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors associated with RLS. Additionally, interdisciplinary research fosters the amalgamation of diverse technologies and methodologies, such as the integration of imaging techniques with molecular biology, facilitating a comprehensive investigation of the relationships between brain structure, function, neurotransmitter activity, and gene expression in individuals with RLS. Interdisciplinary research is anticipated to yield significant advancements in our understanding of RLS and contribute to the development of effective treatment strategies.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in the understanding of RLS, several important challenges remain in research and clinical practice. From an epidemiological perspective, RLS is known to affect a large number of people worldwide, with differences observed across age, sex, and ethnic groups.\nIn terms of genetics, studies have identified several risk genes, although these may only explain a small portion of cases. The exact mechanisms by which these genes contribute to RLS symptoms, especially how they affect brain function or iron metabolism, remain unclear. In addition, the interaction between genetic background and environmental factors, such as iron levels, diet, and lifestyle, requires further investigation.\nAt the biological level, RLS appears to involve imbalances in several brain signaling systems, including dopamine, glutamate, GABA, and adenosine. These changes are often linked to iron deficiency in the brain, which may affect the nerve activity and sleep regulation. However, it is still uncertain how these systems interact and whether one disturbance leads to another disturbance. Further research is needed to understand how changes in brain structure, function, and neurotransmitter levels contribute to the development and progression of RLS.\nCurrently, the diagnosis of RLS still depends mainly on the symptoms reported by patients. Although imaging and blood-based studies have suggested possible biomarkers, none has been widely accepted or used in clinical practice. There is a clear need to identify accurate and practical tests that can help confirm the diagnosis and distinguish RLS from other similar conditions. In addition, current treatments can be effective for many patients but are often limited by side effects or worsening symptoms over time. Although non-drug treatments and TCM may help in some cases, most studies in this area have not met rigorous scientific standards, and more high-quality research is needed to confirm their effectiveness and safety.\nDespite these challenges, new technologies offer several opportunities. For example, gene editing may help to clarify how certain genes affect RLS and could lead to gene-based treatments. Artificial intelligence could help researchers analyze large datasets to discover better diagnostic tools or identify new treatment targets. Encouraging collaboration across disciplines, including neurology, genetics, pharmacology, and traditional medicine, is important for developing more effective strategies to understand and manage RLS in the future.\nIn summary, RLS is a multifactorial neurological disorder with a substantial global burden that exhibits notable variations in prevalence across age groups, sexes, and ethnic populations. Although genetic studies have identified several susceptibility loci, such as MEIS1, BTBD9, and PTPRD, these account for only a small proportion of the heritability, indicating that the genetic architecture of RLS remains incompletely understood. At the pathophysiological level, iron deficiency is thought to play a central role in interacting with the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and adenosinergic systems to disrupt neurochemical homeostasis and contribute to symptom generation.\nAdvancements in diagnostic approaches have led to the refinement of clinical criteria and increased utilization of neuroimaging modalities. However, the lack of objective and universally accepted biomarkers continues to limit early and accurate diagnosis. Therapeutically, dopaminergic agents and α2δ calcium channel ligands remain the mainstay of pharmacological treatment, while non-pharmacological interventions, such as neuromodulation and behavioral therapies, provide additional benefits, particularly for patients with contraindications or poor tolerability to medications. Nonetheless, the long-term use of pharmacological agents is often constrained by risks such as augmentation and reduced efficacy.\nTCM, including herbal formulations and acupuncture, has shown potential in alleviating symptoms in certain patients; however, the current evidence is limited by methodological shortcomings and the absence of standardized outcome measures. To improve clinical management and deepen mechanistic insight, future research should prioritize the integration of multi-omics analyses, identification of reliable biomarkers, and execution of well-designed clinical trials to evaluate emerging and complementary therapies. Thus, advancing the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of RLS will require a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach, with future research benefiting from systematic reviews and meta-analyses to synthesize existing evidence, resolve inconsistencies, and inform evidence-based clinical practices.", "content_for_embedding": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also referred to as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common neurological sensorimotor disorder characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, typically accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, particularly during periods of rest or night.\nThe etiology of RLS is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, iron dysregulation, and disturbances in dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission.\nSeveral fundamental contributions have guided the development of RLS research.\nIn this review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the current state of RLS research encompassing epidemiological patterns, genetic findings, pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic advancements, and evolving treatment paradigms.

Research indicates that these agents are effective in alleviating RLS symptoms and may offer superior safety and tolerability profiles compared to dopamine agonists.\nNonpharmacological interventions play a supportive role in the management of RLS, particularly for patients with mild symptoms, those intolerant to pharmacologic agents, and individuals seeking adjunctive treatments.\nIn addition, certain behavioral therapies, such as massage and warm water baths, have shown symptom-alleviating effects.\nFurthermore, neuromodulatory physical therapy modalities, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcutaneous direct current spinal cord stimulation (tsDCS), are being explored for their utility in RLS treatment.\nDespite encouraging findings, most nonpharmacological therapies remain in the exploratory phase. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate their efficacy, establish standardized protocols, and better define their role in integrated treatment strategies for RLS.\nOwing to variability in symptoms, severity, genetic predispositions, and treatment responses among patients with RLS, it is essential to investigate personalized treatment strategies. When formulating a treatment plan, comprehensive assessment of various patient-specific factors is necessary. For instance, in individuals with iron deficiency, iron replacement therapy may serve as a critical component of treatment, and iron supplementation can rectify abnormal iron metabolism and alleviate RLS symptoms in certain patients, indicating that iron-deficient patients with RLS often experience significant symptom relief after iron supplementation.\nMoreover, treatment customization based on the genetic profiles of patients has garnered increasing attention. Advances in the genetic understanding of RLS have revealed that certain genetic variations may influence patients’ responses to pharmacological interventions. For example, individuals with specific genetic variants may exhibit varying degrees of efficacy when treated with dopamine agonists.\nTCM operates within a unique theoretical framework that differs from the Western biomedical paradigms. Central to TCM is the concept of qi, which refers to the vital energy circulating through the meridians of the body and is essential for maintaining physiological balance.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on the Shaoyao Gancao Decoction indicated that this traditional formulation may help alleviate RLS symptoms; however, the overall quality of evidence was low, highlighting the need for further rigorous validation.\nTaking Shaoyao Gancao Decoction as a case study, some reports indicate that patients experienced significant relief from leg discomfort and improved sleep quality following its administration.\nTCM is generally regarded as a safe treatment option for RLS. Studies examining various TCM prescriptions for RLS have reported relatively fewer adverse reactions.\nRecent consensus guidelines published by the IRLSSG provide a structured algorithm for the pharmacological treatment of RLS, with an emphasis on risk stratification, iron status, and augmentation prevention.\nDopamine receptor agonists, including pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine, are effective for short-term symptom control, but are associated with a well-documented risk of augmentation.\nWhen augmentation occurs, management includes dose reduction, switching to α2δ ligands, or use of long-acting opioids in refractory cases.\nIron deficiency is a key factor that can be modified. IRLSSG and subsequent clinical studies recommend initiating iron replacement therapy when serum ferritin is <75 ng/mL and <100 ng/mL if symptoms are severe or refractory, respectively. Intravenous iron formulations, such as ferric carboxymaltose or iron sucrose, are preferred over oral iron for patients with gastrointestinal intolerance or insufficient response. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant symptom reduction with IV iron administration in patients with serum ferritin levels <75 ng/mL, supporting this approach.\nTaken together, these evidence-based strategies reinforce the importance of individualized therapy based on symptom severity, iron status, and risk of augmentation. Incorporating guideline-informed decision making may improve long-term outcomes and reduce adverse treatment effects.\nEmerging technologies present novel opportunities for investigating RLS. Recent studies have indicated that electronic stimulation may serve as a promising nonpharmacological intervention for RLS. A randomized, single-blind trial involving 46 patients with RLS assessed the efficacy of electronic stimulation (ES) by dividing the participants into active and sham stimulation groups. Utilizing a handheld ES device, the lower legs were stimulated bilaterally in a 3 Hz tapping pattern. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in symptom severity within the active group accompanied by a notable interaction between time and group. These findings suggest that ES may enhance symptom relief when applied at optimal stimulation intensities, positioning it as a potential non-pharmacological treatment alternative for RLS.\nNoninvasive high-frequency peroneal nerve stimulation (NPNS) offers an innovative approach for RLS management. Research involving 20 patients with moderate-to-severe RLS revealed that NPNS effectively alleviated symptoms by activating the leg muscles without disrupting sleep. This study indicated that NPNS could sustain tonic electromyographic (EMG) activity over time, with evoked EMG responses serving as predictors of treatment efficacy. Notably, improvements in the IRLS scores were more pronounced in patients with lower motor thresholds. Additionally, NPNS treatment frequently enhances patients’ self-reported sleep onset.\nResearch on RLS has demonstrated a notable interdisciplinary trend. Given that RLS encompasses various domains including neurology, psychology, and genetics, it is challenging to fully elucidate the mechanisms of morbidity and identify effective treatment modalities within a single discipline. For instance, integration of neuroscience and psychology can enhance our understanding of how psychosocial factors influence RLS. A qualitative analysis of 15 patients with RLS revealed that stigma associated with the loss of physical control and insufficient professional recognition contributed to psychological distress, underscoring the significance of psychosocial elements in the diagnosis and treatment of RLS as well as the necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration in patient care.\nFurthermore, epidemiological-genetic crossover studies utilizing extensive population studies and genetic analyses can provide more precise insights into the genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors associated with RLS. Additionally, interdisciplinary research fosters the amalgamation of diverse technologies and methodologies, such as the integration of imaging techniques with molecular biology, facilitating a comprehensive investigation of the relationships between brain structure, function, neurotransmitter activity, and gene expression in individuals with RLS. Interdisciplinary research is anticipated to yield significant advancements in our understanding of RLS and contribute to the development of effective treatment strategies.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in the understanding of RLS, several important challenges remain in research and clinical practice. From an epidemiological perspective, RLS is known to affect a large number of people worldwide, with differences observed across age, sex, and ethnic groups.\nIn terms of genetics, studies have identified several risk genes, although these may only explain a small portion of cases. The exact mechanisms by which these genes contribute to RLS symptoms, especially how they affect brain function or iron metabolism, remain unclear. In addition, the interaction between genetic background and environmental factors, such as iron levels, diet, and lifestyle, requires further investigation.\nAt the biological level, RLS appears to involve imbalances in several brain signaling systems, including dopamine, glutamate, GABA, and adenosine. These changes are often linked to iron deficiency in the brain, which may affect the nerve activity and sleep regulation. However, it is still uncertain how these systems interact and whether one disturbance leads to another disturbance. Further research is needed to understand how changes in brain structure, function, and neurotransmitter levels contribute to the development and progression of RLS.\nCurrently, the diagnosis of RLS still depends mainly on the symptoms reported by patients. Although imaging and blood-based studies have suggested possible biomarkers, none has been widely accepted or used in clinical practice. There is a clear need to identify accurate and practical tests that can help confirm the diagnosis and distinguish RLS from other similar conditions. In addition, current treatments can be effective for many patients but are often limited by side effects or worsening symptoms over time. Although non-drug treatments and TCM may help in some cases, most studies in this area have not met rigorous scientific standards, and more high-quality research is needed to confirm their effectiveness and safety.\nDespite these challenges, new technologies offer several opportunities. For example, gene editing may help to clarify how certain genes affect RLS and could lead to gene-based treatments. Artificial intelligence could help researchers analyze large datasets to discover better diagnostic tools or identify new treatment targets. Encouraging collaboration across disciplines, including neurology, genetics, pharmacology, and traditional medicine, is important for developing more effective strategies to understand and manage RLS in the future.\nIn summary, RLS is a multifactorial neurological disorder with a substantial global burden that exhibits notable variations in prevalence across age groups, sexes, and ethnic populations. Although genetic studies have identified several susceptibility loci, such as MEIS1, BTBD9, and PTPRD, these account for only a small proportion of the heritability, indicating that the genetic architecture of RLS remains incompletely understood. At the pathophysiological level, iron deficiency is thought to play a central role in interacting with the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and adenosinergic systems to disrupt neurochemical homeostasis and contribute to symptom generation.\nAdvancements in diagnostic approaches have led to the refinement of clinical criteria and increased utilization of neuroimaging modalities. However, the lack of objective and universally accepted biomarkers continues to limit early and accurate diagnosis. Therapeutically, dopaminergic agents and α2δ calcium channel ligands remain the mainstay of pharmacological treatment, while non-pharmacological interventions, such as neuromodulation and behavioral therapies, provide additional benefits, particularly for patients with contraindications or poor tolerability to medications. Nonetheless, the long-term use of pharmacological agents is often constrained by risks such as augmentation and reduced efficacy.\nTCM, including herbal formulations and acupuncture, has shown potential in alleviating symptoms in certain patients; however, the current evidence is limited by methodological shortcomings and the absence of standardized outcome measures. To improve clinical management and deepen mechanistic insight, future research should prioritize the integration of multi-omics analyses, identification of reliable biomarkers, and execution of well-designed clinical trials to evaluate emerging and complementary therapies. Thus, advancing the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of RLS will require a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach, with future research benefiting from systematic reviews and meta-analyses to synthesize existing evidence, resolve inconsistencies, and inform evidence-based clinical practices.", "topic": "Sleep_disorder"}

A tiered approach—screening with questionnaires and actigraphy, followed by targeted PSG—can be pragmatic in resource-limited settings.

These anxiety symptoms may have specific aggravating factors. It was reported that the combined lifetime prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder was 3.7% [\nInsomnia, a common phenomenon in approximately 10% of the adult population in Taiwan, causes substantial impairments in a patient’s quality of life and social interactions. The primary symptom of insomnia is poor quality or insufficient quantity of sleep, including being unable to fall asleep (14.6%) or to stay asleep (13.4%) [\nSi-Ni-San (SNS), a famous Chinese herbal formula, has traditionally been utilized to harmonize the functions of the liver and spleen [\nNetwork pharmacology and molecular docking analysis research shows that SNS helps suppress the activation of dopaminergic synapses and amphetamine addiction signaling pathways [\nTo determine how SNS may protect against anxious insomnia, several genetic, molecular and network pharmacology strategies were used. These include protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. We also applied molecular docking technology to further illustrate the mode of action of SNS at a cellular level and how this could be adopted for future animal experiments.\nFour components in SNS (chaihu, baishao, zhishi and gancao) were respectively input into the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database 2.3 (TCMSP database 2.3,\nGeneCards database (\nTo understand the molecular mechanisms of SNS, a graph of the CCT network was constructed by Cytoscape 3.9.1 software (Cytoscape Team, USA) with topological parameters of nodes, including betweenness centrality (BC) and degree centrality (DC) [\nTo gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms, we used Cytoscape 3.9.1 software (Cytoscape Team, USA) and STRING database v11.5 (\nThe 59 key protein targets of SNS for anxious insomnia were submitted to The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) bioinformatics resources (\nMolecular docking was analyzed using AutoDock 4.2 software, which employs the Lamarckian genetic algorithm [\nFor the anxious insomnia-related potential target genes analysis, a comparison of the potential target genes among generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia and SNS was screened using the GeneCards database, TTD, and CTD, TCMID database and TCMSP database. We used two different databases to provide target genes for SNS. The generalization principle of TCMSP involves extracting target genes separately by capturing four different components from SNS. On the other hand, TCMID extracts target genes from the perspective of the entire herbal formula. Five thousand five hundred seventy-four genes for generalized anxiety disorder, 2,906 genes for insomnia, 101 genes for SNS in TCMSP and 82 genes in TCMID were observed. Based on the Venn diagram analysis in Fig. (\nTo understand the correlations between SNS and its four components with potential target genes related to anxious insomnia, a complex correlation network was constructed. As shown in Fig. (\nWe incorporated 59 target protein molecules (Table\nGO functional enrichment analysis was performed in Fig. (\nA total of 84 pathways were identified in the KEGG signal pathway enrichment analysis. The Top 20 pathways were selected and listed in Fig. (\nThe neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signaling pathway is the most critical aspect of the potential mechanisms of SNS treatment. Generally, most of the target genes were concentrated in serotonergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic systems. The regulation of SNS, SSRIs (\nThe CTP network was constructed by utilizing 20 associated targets listed in Table\nFive selected compounds (β-sitosterol and kaempferol in the baishao component, isorhamnetin in the chaihu component, shinpterocarpin in the gancao component and tetramethoxyluteolin in the zhishi component) were obtained after screening the CCT network and the CTP network. They were docked with AKT1, SLC6A4, ADRB2(Beta-2 adrenergic receptor), MAOA, ACHE (Acetylcholinesterase), ESR1 (Estrogen receptor 1), CYP3A4 (Cytochrome P450 3A4), CHRNA7 (Cholinergic Receptor Nicotinic Alpha 7), GABRA2, HTR2A (5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A) and NOS3 (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3). Generally, the higher the binding energy absolute value, the greater the protein binding affinity of the ligand. As shown in Fig. (\nIn this study, we attempted to recognize all the statistical criteria of SNS components in the CCT network, KEGG analysis and CTP network. We found that the top five active compounds, β-sitosterol and kaempferol in baishao, isorhamnetin in chaihu, shinpterocarpin in gancao and tetramethoxyluteolin in zhishi, represented the most typical therapeutic compounds in SNS. Beta-sitosterol, a phytosterol found in baishao and commonly obtained through daily dietary ingestion, is acquired through intestinal absorption. Beta-sitosterol ingestion leads to the reduction of IL-6, TNF-α, and reactive oxygen species production, and it also suppresses the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway [\nAccording to the analyses by the PPI network, the core target proteins of SNS treating anxious insomnia are AKT1, IL6, TNF, TP53, NOS3, and PPAR. The deficiency of activated AKT1 in laboratory animals resulted in functional and structural deviations in the prefrontal cortex and led to anxiety disorder or widespread cognitive behavioral deficits [\nApart from anti-inflammatory-related mechanisms, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways, including various kinds of synaptic transmission pathways, provided vital clues and characteristics when screening SNS against anxious insomnia. In the PPI network, we picked up target proteins, like SLC6A4, ACHE, MAOA, CHRNA7 and GABRA2, in clusters more related to serotonergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic synapse pathways as second-order core target proteins. These target proteins played crucial roles in synaptic functional management with the neurotransmitter mechanism of presynaptic promotion and reuptake diminishment. SLC6A4 promoter regions have functional polymorphism, which has been associated with manifold aspects of neuroticism and psychopathology, particularly anxiety disorder traits [\nThe KEGG enrichment analysis also demonstrated a similar result found in PPI network analysis, namely that the pathway terms could be separated into two classes: synaptic transmission-related terms and inflammatory response-related terms. In terms related to inflammatory response, the calcium signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and estrogen signaling pathway were identified as potential mechanisms through which SNS may alleviate cell or neuron inflammation in anxious insomnia. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway are crucial for neuronal survival and axonal regeneration following peripheral nerve injury. These pathways facilitate regeneration, neuron survival, and axon extension through BDNF downstream regulation [\nThe results of molecular docking demonstrated that greater protein binding affinities and more highly visualized polar hydrogen bonding displayed the greatest similarity to the actual structures. As shown in the affinity heat map, the docking pairs (isorhamnetin-AKT1, isorhamnetin-SLC6A4, β-sitosterol-MAOA, β-sitosterol-ACHE, isorhamnetin-CHRNA7, and shinpterocarpin-GABRA2) exhibited more stable conformations of ligand-receptor binding between key compounds and core target proteins in the SNS pathway. Isorhamnetin has been proposed to inhibit the phosphorylation cascade of AKT1 and its related signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Isorhamnetin acts as an AKT and MEK inhibitor, demonstrating anti-inflammatory and anti-autophagic effects. It effectively inhibits the proliferation of human breast cancer and gallbladder cancer cells, exhibiting a certain level of cytotoxicity inhibition [\nThere are several limitations in our network-pharmacology and molecular docking analysis study. The data quality of TCM databases may be uncontrolled, incomplete, and heterogeneous, thus necessitating the establishment of uniform and rigorous standards. The application of network pharmacology in SNS research is mainly in the qualitative stage. Besides, there is a dose-response relationship between drugs and diseases. Our network pharmacology technology makes it difficult to achieve the goal of dose quantification. Further exploration is needed, particularly in new algorithm developments, designed animal experiments, and clinical applications, to gain a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of diseases and syndromes, as well as to elucidate the biological basis of SNS [\nOur study, utilizing network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis, has several limitations. Unfortunately, the existing traditional Chinese medicine databases do not show that the components of SNS can regulate proteins related to anxiety insomnia outside the realm of neurotransmitters, nor do they provide effective evidence on how these components modulate these proteins (whether positive or negative regulation). We attempted to use the QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software to simulate potential pathways involving proteins in the pathophysiological mechanisms, aiming to observe more practical regulatory conditions. However, our network pharmacology approach still faces challenges in quantifying this relationship in terms of dosage. This underscores the need for further advancements, particularly in the development of novel algorithms, meticulously designed animal studies, and clinical applications. Our further experimental project tends to confirm the anxiolytic effect of SNS extract on mice subjected to lipopolysaccharide-induced anxiety and p-chlorophenylalanine-induced serotonin depletion insomnia. Anxiety-like and insomnia-like behavior analysis was assessed using the elevated plus-maze test, light-dark box test, and open field test. Besides, to explore the potential mechanisms of SNS underlying the anti-inflammatory and neuroactive regulation, we will assess the expression levels of AKT1, MAOA, ACHE, SLC6A4, CHRNA7 and GABRA2 in the serum, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and amygdala by radioimmunoassay.\nWe explored the potential compounds and protein targets of SNS for the treatment of anxious insomnia using network pharmacology and molecular docking strategies. The therapeutic mechanisms of SNS revolved around inhibiting nerve inflammation, regulating the performance of the neuroprotective effect, and modifying the transmission of neurons and neurotransmitters related to dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic system and their collaboration. Several core active compounds, including beta-sitosterol, kaempferol, tetramethoxyluteolin, isorhamnetin and shinpterocarpin and targets,", "content_for_embedding": "Those who suffer from generalized anxiety disorder may experience feeling unfocused, suffer disquiet, or anxiety for no obvious reason. These anxiety symptoms may have specific aggravating factors. It was reported that the combined lifetime prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder was 3.7% [\nInsomnia, a common phenomenon in approximately 10% of the adult population in Taiwan, causes substantial impairments in a patient’s quality of life and social interactions. The primary symptom of insomnia is poor quality or insufficient quantity of sleep, including being unable to fall asleep (14.6%) or to stay asleep (13.4%) [\nSi-Ni-San (SNS), a famous Chinese herbal formula, has traditionally been utilized to harmonize the functions of the liver and spleen [\nNetwork pharmacology and molecular docking analysis research shows that SNS helps suppress the activation of dopaminergic synapses and amphetamine addiction signaling pathways [\nTo determine how SNS may protect against anxious insomnia, several genetic, molecular and network pharmacology strategies were used. These include protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. We also applied molecular docking technology to further illustrate the mode of action of SNS at a cellular level and how this could be adopted for future animal experiments.\nFour components in SNS (chaihu, baishao, zhishi and gancao) were respectively input into the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database 2.3 (TCMSP database 2.3,\nGeneCards database (\nTo understand the molecular mechanisms of SNS, a graph of the CCT network was constructed by Cytoscape 3.9.1 software (Cytoscape Team, USA) with topological parameters of nodes, including betweenness centrality (BC) and degree centrality (DC) [\nTo gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms, we used Cytoscape 3.9.1 software (Cytoscape Team, USA) and STRING database v11.5 (\nThe 59 key protein targets of SNS for anxious insomnia were submitted to The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) bioinformatics resources (\nMolecular docking was analyzed using AutoDock 4.2 software, which employs the Lamarckian genetic algorithm [\nFor the anxious insomnia-related potential target genes analysis, a comparison of the potential target genes among generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia and SNS was screened using the GeneCards database, TTD, and CTD, TCMID database and TCMSP database. We used two different databases to provide target genes for SNS. The generalization principle of TCMSP involves extracting target genes separately by capturing four different components from SNS. On the other hand, TCMID extracts target genes from the perspective of the entire herbal formula. Five thousand five hundred seventy-four genes for generalized anxiety disorder, 2,906 genes for insomnia, 101 genes for SNS in TCMSP and 82 genes in TCMID were observed. Based on the Venn diagram analysis in Fig. (\nTo understand the correlations between SNS and its four components with potential target genes related to anxious insomnia, a complex correlation network was constructed. As shown in Fig. (\nWe incorporated 59 target protein molecules (Table\nGO functional enrichment analysis was performed in Fig. (\nA total of 84 pathways were identified in the KEGG signal pathway enrichment analysis. The Top 20 pathways were selected and listed in Fig. (\nThe neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction signaling pathway is the most critical aspect of the potential mechanisms of SNS treatment. Generally, most of the target genes were concentrated in serotonergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic systems. The regulation of SNS, SSRIs (\nThe CTP network was constructed by utilizing 20 associated targets listed in Table\nFive selected compounds (β-sitosterol and kaempferol in the baishao component, isorhamnetin in the chaihu component, shinpterocarpin in the gancao component and tetramethoxyluteolin in the zhishi component) were obtained after screening the CCT network and the CTP network. They were docked with AKT1, SLC6A4, ADRB2(Beta-2 adrenergic receptor), MAOA, ACHE (Acetylcholinesterase), ESR1 (Estrogen receptor 1), CYP3A4 (Cytochrome P450 3A4), CHRNA7 (Cholinergic Receptor Nicotinic Alpha 7), GABRA2, HTR2A (5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A) and NOS3 (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3). Generally, the higher the binding energy absolute value, the greater the protein binding affinity of the ligand. As shown in Fig. (\nIn this study, we attempted to recognize all the statistical criteria of SNS components in the CCT network, KEGG analysis and CTP network. We found that the top five active compounds, β-sitosterol and kaempferol in baishao, isorhamnetin in chaihu, shinpterocarpin in gancao and tetramethoxyluteolin in zhishi, represented the most typical therapeutic compounds in SNS. Beta-sitosterol, a phytosterol found in baishao and commonly obtained through daily dietary ingestion, is acquired through intestinal absorption. Beta-sitosterol ingestion leads to the reduction of IL-6, TNF-α, and reactive oxygen species production, and it also suppresses the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway [\nAccording to the analyses by the PPI network, the core target proteins of SNS treating anxious insomnia are AKT1, IL6, TNF, TP53, NOS3, and PPAR. The deficiency of activated AKT1 in laboratory animals resulted in functional and structural deviations in the prefrontal cortex and led to anxiety disorder or widespread cognitive behavioral deficits [\nApart from anti-inflammatory-related mechanisms, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways, including various kinds of synaptic transmission pathways, provided vital clues and characteristics when screening SNS against anxious insomnia. In the PPI network, we picked up target proteins, like SLC6A4, ACHE, MAOA, CHRNA7 and GABRA2, in clusters more related to serotonergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic synapse pathways as second-order core target proteins. These target proteins played crucial roles in synaptic functional management with the neurotransmitter mechanism of presynaptic promotion and reuptake diminishment. SLC6A4 promoter regions have functional polymorphism, which has been associated with manifold aspects of neuroticism and psychopathology, particularly anxiety disorder traits [\nThe KEGG enrichment analysis also demonstrated a similar result found in PPI network analysis, namely that the pathway terms could be separated into two classes: synaptic transmission-related terms and inflammatory response-related terms. In terms related to inflammatory response, the calcium signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and estrogen signaling pathway were identified as potential mechanisms through which SNS may alleviate cell or neuron inflammation in anxious insomnia. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway are crucial for neuronal survival and axonal regeneration following peripheral nerve injury. These pathways facilitate regeneration, neuron survival, and axon extension through BDNF downstream regulation [\nThe results of molecular docking demonstrated that greater protein binding affinities and more highly visualized polar hydrogen bonding displayed the greatest similarity to the actual structures. As shown in the affinity heat map, the docking pairs (isorhamnetin-AKT1, isorhamnetin-SLC6A4, β-sitosterol-MAOA, β-sitosterol-ACHE, isorhamnetin-CHRNA7, and shinpterocarpin-GABRA2) exhibited more stable conformations of ligand-receptor binding between key compounds and core target proteins in the SNS pathway.
