The results showed that the tirofiban group had a significantly lower incidence of early progressive stroke (ED) (4/72, 5.6%) versus the dual antiplatelet group (9/67, 13.4%). However, there were no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and mortality (both χ² = 0.00,\nOur results showed that tirofiban treatment achieved significant improvements in multiple outcome measures. First, the mRS score improved more significantly after 3 months of tirofiban treatment than dual antiplatelet therapy, while there was no increase in death and bleeding, indicating the effectiveness and safety of intravenous tirofiban, which is consistent with the results of ESCAPIST and RESCUEBT2\nSecond, our results showed that NIHSS scores were lower and BI scores higher in the tirofiban group compared to the dual antiplatelet group 3 months after treatment, which differs from the findings of the RESCUE BT2 study. This discrepancy may partly result from differences in patient inclusion criteria. The RESCUE BT2 study included patients with limb functional disability and NIHSS scores > 5. In contrast, our study did not strictly emphasize limb functional disability. Some patients in this study had other impairments, such as sensory, language, articulation, or facial movement abnormalities. These subjective factors, particularly in sensation and language, may have interfered with their functional scores.\nIn the subgroup analysis, we found that patients with basal ganglia stroke showed significant improvements in all 3 outcome measures (NIHSS, mRS, and BI). In contrast, no significant treatment effects were observed for any outcome measures in patients with cerebellar or brainstem strokes. Previous studies on tirofiban’s efficacy based on neuroimaging characteristics have found that it is more effective in treating anterior circulation stroke than posterior circulation stroke\nIL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine and an inflammatory response marker. Its expression is induced during brain tissue ischemia and necrosis, causing endothelial cell damage and promoting leukocyte adhesion and aggregation. This cascade facilitates microemboli formation, obstructing small blood vessels and worsening neuronal ischemia and hypoxia. Lu et al.\nCollectively, this study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of tirofiban in the treatment of patients with AIS. However, as this is a retrospective, non-randomized controlled study with a limited sample size per group and potential selection bias, prospective randomized controlled studies are needed in the future to further validate the conclusions.\nBy specifically and reversibly binding to platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptors, tirofiban can improve the 90-day prognosis of patients with small vessel occlusive AIS who have not received intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment within 72 h of symptom onset. Tirofiban treatment does not increase the incidence of death or bleeding complications. Our data support that tirofiban is both effective and safe for the treatment of early AIS, thus providing a clinical reference for the rational treatment of patients within this time window.", "content_for_embedding": "Stroke is a common neurological disease, with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) being the most frequent, characterized by high mortality and disability rates\nThe 2018 “Guidelines for the Early Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke” from the American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association (ASA) states that for patients with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ≤ 3 (minor stroke caused by small artery occlusion or other factors), aspirin (75 mg/day) combined with clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 21 days can effectively improve prognosis without increasing hemorrhagic events\nGPIIb/IIIa receptors represent the final common pathway for platelet aggregation and thrombosis.

The patients were divided into a tirofiban group and a dual antiplatelet group. The results showed that the tirofiban group had a significantly lower incidence of early progressive stroke (ED) (4/72, 5.6%) versus the dual antiplatelet group (9/67, 13.4%). However, there were no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and mortality (both χ² = 0.00,\nOur results showed that tirofiban treatment achieved significant improvements in multiple outcome measures. First, the mRS score improved more significantly after 3 months of tirofiban treatment than dual antiplatelet therapy, while there was no increase in death and bleeding, indicating the effectiveness and safety of intravenous tirofiban, which is consistent with the results of ESCAPIST and RESCUEBT2\nSecond, our results showed that NIHSS scores were lower and BI scores higher in the tirofiban group compared to the dual antiplatelet group 3 months after treatment, which differs from the findings of the RESCUE BT2 study. This discrepancy may partly result from differences in patient inclusion criteria. The RESCUE BT2 study included patients with limb functional disability and NIHSS scores > 5. In contrast, our study did not strictly emphasize limb functional disability. Some patients in this study had other impairments, such as sensory, language, articulation, or facial movement abnormalities. These subjective factors, particularly in sensation and language, may have interfered with their functional scores.\nIn the subgroup analysis, we found that patients with basal ganglia stroke showed significant improvements in all 3 outcome measures (NIHSS, mRS, and BI). In contrast, no significant treatment effects were observed for any outcome measures in patients with cerebellar or brainstem strokes. Previous studies on tirofiban’s efficacy based on neuroimaging characteristics have found that it is more effective in treating anterior circulation stroke than posterior circulation stroke\nIL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine and an inflammatory response marker. Its expression is induced during brain tissue ischemia and necrosis, causing endothelial cell damage and promoting leukocyte adhesion and aggregation. This cascade facilitates microemboli formation, obstructing small blood vessels and worsening neuronal ischemia and hypoxia. Lu et al.\nCollectively, this study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of tirofiban in the treatment of patients with AIS. However, as this is a retrospective, non-randomized controlled study with a limited sample size per group and potential selection bias, prospective randomized controlled studies are needed in the future to further validate the conclusions.\nBy specifically and reversibly binding to platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptors, tirofiban can improve the 90-day prognosis of patients with small vessel occlusive AIS who have not received intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment within 72 h of symptom onset. Tirofiban treatment does not increase the incidence of death or bleeding complications. Our data support that tirofiban is both effective and safe for the treatment of early AIS, thus providing a clinical reference for the rational treatment of patients within this time window.", "topic": "Stroke_Management"}

Prior to formal assessment, all experts attended a standardized training session and received a structured evaluation manual, which included detailed explanations of each scoring dimension, illustrative examples, and response interpretation guidelines. These measures aimed to promote consistent understanding of the evaluation framework and reduce interrater variability.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize expert and patient ratings as means, SDs, and medians. In phase 1, differences among the 4 LLMs were assessed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey Honestly Significant Difference for post hoc comparisons if normality assumptions (tested via the Shapiro-Wilk test) were met.

Post hoc analysis was performed using Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test to examine intermodel differences. Additionally, dot plots were generated using the HIPLOT web-based tool [\nThis study was approved by the medical ethics committee of Shanghai East Hospital (approval no.: 2025YS-042). All participants provided written informed consent prior to participation. Data collected from participants were anonymized to ensure privacy and confidentiality. Participants received a small gift (approximately RMB 30 [US $4.18]) as a token of appreciation for their time and involvement, in accordance with institutional ethics guidelines. No identifiable personal information is included in the manuscript or supplementary materials (\nSix experts evaluated the responses generated by the LLMs across 5 dimensions: accuracy, comprehensiveness, readability, safety, and user-centeredness.\nAmong the models, ChatGPT-4 achieved the highest scores across all dimensions, with particularly outstanding performance in safety (mean 4.38, SD 0.81) and humanity (mean 4.65, SD 0.65). MedGo performed well in accuracy (mean 4.06, SD 0.78) and completeness (mean 4.06, SD 0.74) but was slightly inferior to ChatGPT-4 in the humanity dimension. Qwen and ERNIE Bot received significantly lower scores than both ChatGPT-4 and MedGo.\nDescriptive statistics (\nAmong the 20 scoring files, Krippendorff α values ranged from 0.26 to 0.75. A total of 14 files (14/20, 70%) demonstrated at least fair interrater agreement (α≥.50). The remaining files (6/20, 30%) fell below the 0.50 threshold, indicating lower reliability. Dimensions such as safety and humanistic care generally showed higher consistency, particularly when evaluated for ChatGPT and MedGo. In contrast, comprehensiveness ratings and responses from Qwen and ERNIE Bot yielded more variability across expert scores. Cohen κ coefficients showed substantial variation across expert subgroups: clinical physicians had fair agreement (κ=0.28), while nursing experts (κ=0.03) and rehabilitation therapists (κ=−0.13) showed poor or even negative agreement (\nNot available.\nDescriptive statistics for the objective readability analysis are shown in\nThe results of the one-way ANOVA are shown in\nA total of 30 eligible patients were recruited, generating 90 questions (\nA 2-tailed paired\nThis study evaluated the performance of ChatGPT-4, MedGo, Qwen, and ERNIE Bot in providing health education for patients with stroke undergoing home rehabilitation.\nIn phase 1, ChatGPT-4 demonstrated the best overall performance across all dimensions, excelling particularly in humanity and safety. This finding aligns with previous studies [\nIn phase 2 of patient interactions, ChatGPT-4 received higher ratings than MedGo, but overall, the ratings were lower than those given by the expert group. This discrepancy is mainly due to the challenges patients face in evaluating the models, including variations in personal understanding, needs, and the models’ performance and applicability. This is particularly evident when dealing with complex medical information. As supported by the inverse correlation between text length and satisfaction, ChatGPT-4’s detailed explanations and high reading difficulty could exceed the working memory and understanding capacity of the older adult, imposing heavy cognitive burden on them. Moreover, as artificial intelligence (AI) in medical decision-making is still developing, patients tend to be more skeptical of the models’ accuracy and reliability, often finding their responses unclear. In contrast, experts, with their accumulated knowledge and familiarity with medical terminology, are better equipped to interpret the models’ medical information, resulting in higher ratings.\nThere are significant differences in the areas of focus between patients and experts. Patients tend to prioritize rehabilitation methods, outcomes and safety, emotional support, and equipment-related concerns, reflecting their practical needs and psychological state during rehabilitation. Many patients with stroke are primarily concerned with improving their quality of life through daily management and care. Given the psychological pressures they face during rehabilitation, emotional support is also crucial. In contrast, experts focus on the effectiveness of rehabilitation plans, safety in technical aspects, and the dissemination of theoretical knowledge. As professionals, they are more likely to base treatment and rehabilitation plans on scientific evidence.\nThis disparity highlights the communication gap between experts and patients in health care. Patients may struggle to fully understand certain medical terms and treatment approaches, leading to confusion or anxiety about their rehabilitation plans. While experts emphasize treatment outcomes and safety, they must also consider how to effectively communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, fostering a correct understanding of rehabilitation and improving treatment adherence.\nAccording to standardized prompts, each LLM was asked to provide sources for their responses. ChatGPT-4 did not explicitly cite references, but its answers, based on its extensive training dataset, generally aligned with medical knowledge and clinical practice. In contrast, MedGo provided more detailed medical support, citing specific medical literature, treatment guidelines, and clinical studies. However, the responses from Qwen and ERNIE Bot lacked clear citations of literature and concrete clinical evidence.\nSome responses from the LLMs contained significant errors, which exposed critical safety vulnerabilities. For example, in question 3, which addressed the optimal period for stroke rehabilitation, Qwen incorrectly stated that the chronic phase of stroke begins 3 months after onset. According to various medical guidelines, the chronic phase typically starts 6 months after a stroke, making Qwen’s response inconsistent with these guidelines. Temporal misclassification may lead to premature termination of intensive therapy, reducing motor function recovery by 15%‐22% [\nAnalysis revealed that ChatGPT-4 made fewer errors, although it occasionally produced “hallucinations” due to issues with patient language expression. MedGo demonstrated high accuracy but lacked personalized care. Qwen and ERNIE Bot provided incomplete and vague responses.\nThe errors observed in the LLMs could impact patient rehabilitation to some extent. This is primarily because LLMs generate responses based on statistical language models rather than true understanding of the questions. They lack genuine comprehension and reasoning abilities. Their training depends heavily on large volumes of open-text data from the web, which does not guarantee the quality or timeliness of the answers. Medical knowledge is vast and complex, and the capabilities of LLMs vary. General-purpose LLMs struggle with specialized medical language and often lack explainability. These models are particularly prone to errors in areas such as disease diagnosis, drug effects, and emerging medical issues.\nTherefore, when addressing medical questions, especially in health care decision-making, reliance on AI models should be approached with caution. Professional medical judgment remains irreplaceable, particularly when it concerns patient health and treatment plans.\nA growing body of literature has evaluated the capabilities of LLMs across a wide range of clinical tasks, particularly in areas such as diagnosis support [\nIn contrast, LLM applications in the domain of stroke and rehabilitation have been relatively limited and primarily focused on acute care or clinical prediction tasks. For example, one recent study used GPT-4 to predict 90-day mortality in ischemic stroke management [\nFurthermore, while ChatGPT-4 has consistently demonstrated strong performance in prior research [\nAnother key distinction is our methodological framework. Many previous studies relied solely on expert judgments or automatic evaluation metrics. In contrast, our design includes both multidisciplinary expert ratings and real patient scoring, offering a dual-perspective validation framework. This approach provides ecological relevance by reflecting both clinical quality and user-perceived usefulness—dimensions often overlooked in LLM assessment [\nFinally, our findings underscore the need for task-specific, longitudinal, and patient-centered evaluation of LLMs. Future research should incorporate more diverse rehabilitation populations, integrate multilingual models (eg, Qwen-2.5Max, Gemini, and Med-Gemini), and assess user trust, emotional alignment, and practical impact over time. The creation and evaluation standards for medical LLMs must be actively developed by the medical community [\nAlthough this study provides valuable insights into the application of LLMs in home-based stroke rehabilitation health education, several limitations should be noted. First, the expert sample size was small, with only 6 experts participating in the ratings, which may have affected the comprehensiveness and representativeness of the evaluations. The interrater consistency among experts was limited. This variability may stem from several factors, including differing professional perspectives, variable familiarity with LLM outputs, and inherent subjectivity in evaluating response quality across multiple dimensions. Furthermore, some rating criteria—such as “empathy” or “clinical applicability”—may be interpreted differently by clinicians and nonclinicians. Second, to facilitate patient understanding and streamline the rating process, only a satisfaction scale was used in the second phase of interaction, resulting in a simplified rating criterion. Third, the initial question design did not sufficiently address issues related to patient emotions and adherence. These dimensions were not apparent during phase 1, when questions were primarily developed based on medical platforms and existing literature—sources that tend to focus more on clinical procedures than on psychological or behavioral needs. However, during phase 2, through patient interviews and analysis of interaction data, we recognized that emotional fluctuations and treatment adherence play a vital role in the success of home-based rehabilitation. Fourth, the broader implementation of LLMs requires careful consideration of their economic viability, feasibility, and sustainability. While this study focused primarily on the academic perspective, real-world applications must address cost-effectiveness, technological barriers, and the potential impact on health care institutions. Based on comparable systems, deploying LLMs would incur application programming interface and graphics processing unit maintenance costs, while cost savings emerge when the clinic workload is reduced. However, whether breakeven can be approached remains unknown [\nFuture research should focus on the following aspects. First, studies should consider increasing the number of expert raters within each professional subgroup to average out individual bias, standardizing scoring rubrics through iterative training, and using consensus-building techniques such as Delphi methods or calibration rounds prior to formal scoring. It may also be beneficial to incorporate mixed methods triangulation (eg, combining expert scores with patient evaluations or objective metrics) to strengthen the robustness of model performance assessments [\nThis 2-phase evaluation demonstrated that LLMs, particularly ChatGPT-4 and MedGo, show considerable promise in supporting home-based stroke rehabilitation education. ChatGPT-4 achieved the highest scores across all expert-evaluated dimensions, excelling in user-centeredness and comprehensiveness, while MedGo, a domain-specific model, produced more concise, evidence-based responses. In contrast, general purpose models such as Qwen and ERNIE Bot performed less consistently across key evaluation criteria. Notably, patients’ satisfaction ratings were lower than those of experts, highlighting potential usability challenges related to language complexity and trust in automated responses. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM-generated content with patient comprehension levels, emotional needs, and health literacy. Future work should focus on the development of hybrid models that integrate the conversational fluency of general purpose LLMs with the domain accuracy of medically trained models. Additional studies involving diverse patient populations, longitudinal designs, and real-world deployment scenarios are warranted to ensure safe, effective, and equitable integration of LLMs into patient-centered rehabilitation care.", "content_for_embedding": "Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability among middle-aged and older adult individuals worldwide.

LLMs possess powerful language comprehension and generation capabilities, enabling them to deliver personalized, easily understandable health guidance tailored to patients’ needs [\nTo address these challenges, Shanghai East Hospital developed MedGo in 2024, a specialized Chinese medical LLM designed to assist health care professionals in clinical decision-making and medical consultations. MedGo has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in medical task processing, ranking among the top models in the Chinese Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark and excelling in medical question-answering assessments [\nTo evaluate the practical effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we selected 4 representative models for comparison: ChatGPT-4, MedGo, Qwen, and ERNIE Bot. These models were chosen based on their diversity in orientation (general-purpose vs medical-specific), availability to Chinese users, and technological maturity at the time of study design. ChatGPT-4 and Qwen are general-purpose LLMs widely recognized for their advanced dialogue and multilingual capabilities. ERNIE Bot, developed by Baidu, is a leading domestic model with robust Chinese language processing.

Women represented about 25% of the overall population, and sex specific outcomes were reported in a minority (about 40%) of otherwise eligible randomised trials. Overall, more intensive versus less intensive antithrombotic therapies, including a broad variety of antiplatelet or anticoagulant comparisons, were associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction by approximately 15% and stent thrombosis by around 30% at the expense of an increased risk of major bleeding by more than 40%. The efficacy and safety profile of antithrombotic therapies was consistent in both female and male patients, suggesting the absence of a clinically relevant sex related heterogeneity.\nIn line with existing findings, this study confirms the underrepresentation of female patients, which were approximately a quarter of the overall population with a diagnosis of established coronary artery disease. Although the causes of low enrolment of women in trials remain difficult to ascertain, several hypotheses have been raised that might explain this finding. Demographically, clinically relevant coronary artery disease in women occurs at a more advanced age than in men, and older patients are less likely to be included in randomised trials.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first sex based, quantitative synopsis of clinical research on antithrombotic therapy over 20 years. Overall, more intensive antithrombotic strategies were associated with a reduced risk of ischaemic events—including myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis—in both female and male patients. Although we found no heterogeneity in the treatment effect between sexes, the observed reductions in all cause and cardiovascular death were modest and seemed less pronounced in females. This likely reflects a greater imprecision in risk estimates in this subgroup. The ischaemic benefit conferred by more intensive regimens was counterbalanced by an increased risk of major bleeding in both sexes, with a relative risk increase of 47% in women and 48% in men. Given that major bleeding and myocardial infarction have comparable effects on mortality,\nPrevious research documented sex specific differences in platelet biology, including higher baseline platelet count, increased rate of high platelet reactivity before using antiplatelet therapy, and a different modulation of platelet activity and thrombus formation related to sex hormones.\nThe results of this study should be interpreted in view of several limitations. Similarly to any meta-analysis, differences existed in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of each trial as well as in endpoint definitions. We included highly different comparisons, with antithrombotic strategies classified as more intensive or less intensive irrespective of the experimental or control arm definition. In this respect, a “lumping” approach should be preferred over a “narrow” approach to increase generalisability and avoid overemphasis of minor differences between interventions.\nOur systematic review and meta-analysis, which included 274 433 patients with documented coronary artery disease across 33 randomised trials, found no sex based differences in the treatment effect of antithrombotic therapies. Appropriate use of guideline directed antithrombotic therapies should therefore be the same in women and men. Our study also highlights the need for improved reporting of sex specific outcomes in randomised trials and for further research to optimise antithrombotic strategies in female patients.\nRandomised trials have shown a benefit of antithrombotic therapy for the secondary prevention of ischaemic events\nHowever, generalisability of these findings to female patients is limited by their underrepresentation across trials\nWhether the risk of ischaemic and bleeding outcomes associated with more intensive versus less intensive antithrombotic therapies differs between women and men is uncertain\nNo sex based differences were found in the treatment effect of more intensive versus less intensive antithrombotic therapies\nA patient’s sex should not guide selection of antithrombotic therapies in people with established coronary artery disease", "content_for_embedding": "Antithrombotic therapy, encompassing antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, is a guideline recommended standard of care for patients with established coronary artery disease.\nAgainst this background, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials providing sex stratified outcomes to evaluate whether the efficacy and safety of antithrombotic therapies differ between female and male patients with established coronary artery disease.\nWe followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.\nWe included trials reporting sex specific outcomes and comparing different antithrombotic strategies in patients with established coronary artery disease, irrespective of their clinical presentation or management. The main inclusion criteria were interventional randomised trials comparing any different antithrombotic strategies in patients with documented coronary artery disease; investigation of at least one of the following antithrombotic regimens (or any combination thereof): aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, cangrelor, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, vitamin K antagonists, eptifibatide, abciximab, tirofiban, and bivalirudin; inclusion of at least 500 patients per arm; and availability of at least one outcome of interest stratified by sex. Exclusion criteria were observational studies, inclusion of less than 20% of patients with coronary artery disease, and trials primarily conducted in the setting of concomitant conditions, such as atrial fibrillation, left ventricular thrombus, or venous thromboembolism, which already require oral anticoagulant therapy irrespective of the presence or absence of concomitant coronary artery disease.

According to the World Health Organization, more than 15 million people experience a stroke annually, resulting in approximately 6 million deaths and leaving millions more with varying degrees of long-term disability [\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced, gaining significant attention in the medical and health care fields due to their advancements in natural language processing. LLMs possess powerful language comprehension and generation capabilities, enabling them to deliver personalized, easily understandable health guidance tailored to patients’ needs [\nTo address these challenges, Shanghai East Hospital developed MedGo in 2024, a specialized Chinese medical LLM designed to assist health care professionals in clinical decision-making and medical consultations. MedGo has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in medical task processing, ranking among the top models in the Chinese Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark and excelling in medical question-answering assessments [\nTo evaluate the practical effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we selected 4 representative models for comparison: ChatGPT-4, MedGo, Qwen, and ERNIE Bot. These models were chosen based on their diversity in orientation (general-purpose vs medical-specific), availability to Chinese users, and technological maturity at the time of study design. ChatGPT-4 and Qwen are general-purpose LLMs widely recognized for their advanced dialogue and multilingual capabilities. ERNIE Bot, developed by Baidu, is a leading domestic model with robust Chinese language processing. MedGo, as a medical-specific model developed within the Chinese clinical context, brings unique relevance to health care applications.

By offering a more precise and safer rehabilitation education pathway, this research seeks to advance the application of LLMs in health care, providing a more efficient and scientifically sound solution for home rehabilitation for patients with stroke. The findings have significant academic and practical implications for promoting the adoption of LLMs in health care.\nThis study was conducted from January 5 to February 22, 2025. Using both quantitative and qualitative analyses, the study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in home-based stroke rehabilitation education.\nThis study compared 4 representative LLMs—ChatGPT-4, MedGo, Qwen-Max, and ERNIE Bot V3.5—based on their accessibility, medical relevance, and model diversity (\nNot available.\nThe study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in home-based stroke rehabilitation education. By comparing the performance of responses from 4 different LLMs and incorporating expert ratings and patient feedback [\nCommon inquiries about home rehabilitation for patients with stroke from the past 3 years were done and summarized from web-based medical platforms, including “DingXiangYuan,” “HaoDF,” “Baidu Health Ask a Doctor,” and “AliHealth.” Additionally, international stroke rehabilitation guidelines [\nUsing this feedback and incorporating the clinical experience of neurorehabilitation nursing experts, a set of 15 targeted questions and 2 common home rehabilitation case scenarios were compiled. Case 1 focused on improving limb mobility and self-care abilities in daily life, with an emphasis on blood pressure control. Case 2 addressed not only limb and gait training but also speech and swallowing rehabilitation, diabetes management, and shoulder pain relief. The questionnaire is shown in\nTo enhance the professionalism and specificity of LLM responses, ensuring that they address questions from a targeted perspective and align closely with real-world applications, a standardized prompt was added before each model-generated response. The prompt instructed the following:\n\nFifteen home rehabilitation questions and 2 clinical cases related to stroke were input into 4 different LLMs. Each model received the inputs 3 times, with each iteration conducted in a new conversation to eliminate prior chat history, allowing for an assessment of response consistency. The responses from all models were recorded in plain text format [\nA Likert 5-point rating scale was used to assess the outputs of the 4 LLMs across five dimensions: accuracy, completeness, readability, safety, and humanity. (1)\nExperts could provide brief explanations in the comment section if they had concerns about any response. The detailed definitions of the Likert 5-point rating scale are provided in\nA total of 6 stroke rehabilitation experts (\nTo minimize potential evaluator bias, all experts were blinded to the identities and affiliations of the 4 LLMs. The model outputs were anonymized and randomly ordered, with 3 independent rounds of scoring using distinct response samples in each round. Following a blind evaluation protocol, the experts assessed the outputs of the 4 LLMs across 5 dimensions. Prior to formal assessment, all experts attended a standardized training session and received a structured evaluation manual, which included detailed explanations of each scoring dimension, illustrative examples, and response interpretation guidelines. These measures aimed to promote consistent understanding of the evaluation framework and reduce interrater variability. Experts completed their assessments independently and were instructed not to communicate with one another during the scoring process. Additionally, the 6 experts conducted an interpretability analysis of the responses generated by the 4 LLMs. The expert scoring data can be found in\nThirty patients with stroke were recruited in Shanghai. The 2 top-performing models from phase 1 were selected for interaction with the patients in a real clinical setting. Each patient asked both models 3 questions related to home-based stroke rehabilitation. The researchers recorded the responses and independently rated them using a satisfaction scale. Patient questions and scoring data can be found in\n\nPatients diagnosed with stroke (including ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke) who meet the diagnostic criteria in the\nPatients in the rehabilitation phase (1‐12 months post discharge, with ongoing rehabilitation needs).\nPatients undergoing home-based rehabilitation (not long-term hospitalized).\nPatients with basic communication skills, able to express their needs accurately (or with a family member to assist in communication).\n\nPatients with severe cognitive impairments or those unable to accurately express their needs.\nPatients unable to undergo home-based rehabilitation (eg, those requiring long-term hospitalization due to the severity of their condition).\nPatients with other serious comorbidities (eg, end-stage cancer and severe heart failure) that would interfere with the rehabilitation plan.\nThe assessment criterion was patient satisfaction, based on the following specific criteria (\nPlease select the option that best reflects your overall feeling toward the model’s response.\n1 Point.

Satisfied: The response from the model is satisfactory, and most of the questions have been answered effectively.\n5 Points. Very satisfied: The response from the model is excellent, and all questions have been answered very well.\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 27 (IBM Corp) and R (version 4.5.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize expert and patient ratings as means, SDs, and medians. In phase 1, differences among the 4 LLMs were assessed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey Honestly Significant Difference for post hoc comparisons if normality assumptions (tested via the Shapiro-Wilk test) were met. For nonnormally distributed or heteroscedastic data, the Kruskal-Wallis H test and Mann-Whitney\nAn objective readability analysis was conducted on the responses generated by the 4 LLMs using a Chinese Readability Assessment Platform. This web-based tool [\nA one-way ANOVA was used to assess differences among the 4 LLMs in terms of word count, reading difficulty scores, and recommended reading age. Post hoc analysis was performed using Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test to examine intermodel differences. Additionally, dot plots were generated using the HIPLOT web-based tool [\nThis study was approved by the medical ethics committee of Shanghai East Hospital (approval no.: 2025YS-042). All participants provided written informed consent prior to participation. Data collected from participants were anonymized to ensure privacy and confidentiality. Participants received a small gift (approximately RMB 30 [US $4.18]) as a token of appreciation for their time and involvement, in accordance with institutional ethics guidelines. No identifiable personal information is included in the manuscript or supplementary materials (\nSix experts evaluated the responses generated by the LLMs across 5 dimensions: accuracy, comprehensiveness, readability, safety, and user-centeredness.\nAmong the models, ChatGPT-4 achieved the highest scores across all dimensions, with particularly outstanding performance in safety (mean 4.38, SD 0.81) and humanity (mean 4.65, SD 0.65). MedGo performed well in accuracy (mean 4.06, SD 0.78) and completeness (mean 4.06, SD 0.74) but was slightly inferior to ChatGPT-4 in the humanity dimension. Qwen and ERNIE Bot received significantly lower scores than both ChatGPT-4 and MedGo.\nDescriptive statistics (\nAmong the 20 scoring files, Krippendorff α values ranged from 0.26 to 0.75. A total of 14 files (14/20, 70%) demonstrated at least fair interrater agreement (α≥.50). The remaining files (6/20, 30%) fell below the 0.50 threshold, indicating lower reliability. Dimensions such as safety and humanistic care generally showed higher consistency, particularly when evaluated for ChatGPT and MedGo. In contrast, comprehensiveness ratings and responses from Qwen and ERNIE Bot yielded more variability across expert scores. Cohen κ coefficients showed substantial variation across expert subgroups: clinical physicians had fair agreement (κ=0.28), while nursing experts (κ=0.03) and rehabilitation therapists (κ=−0.13) showed poor or even negative agreement (\nNot available.\nDescriptive statistics for the objective readability analysis are shown in\nThe results of the one-way ANOVA are shown in\nA total of 30 eligible patients were recruited, generating 90 questions (\nA 2-tailed paired\nThis study evaluated the performance of ChatGPT-4, MedGo, Qwen, and ERNIE Bot in providing health education for patients with stroke undergoing home rehabilitation.\nIn phase 1, ChatGPT-4 demonstrated the best overall performance across all dimensions, excelling particularly in humanity and safety. This finding aligns with previous studies [\nIn phase 2 of patient interactions, ChatGPT-4 received higher ratings than MedGo, but overall, the ratings were lower than those given by the expert group. This discrepancy is mainly due to the challenges patients face in evaluating the models, including variations in personal understanding, needs, and the models’ performance and applicability. This is particularly evident when dealing with complex medical information. As supported by the inverse correlation between text length and satisfaction, ChatGPT-4’s detailed explanations and high reading difficulty could exceed the working memory and understanding capacity of the older adult, imposing heavy cognitive burden on them. Moreover, as artificial intelligence (AI) in medical decision-making is still developing, patients tend to be more skeptical of the models’ accuracy and reliability, often finding their responses unclear. In contrast, experts, with their accumulated knowledge and familiarity with medical terminology, are better equipped to interpret the models’ medical information, resulting in higher ratings.\nThere are significant differences in the areas of focus between patients and experts. Patients tend to prioritize rehabilitation methods, outcomes and safety, emotional support, and equipment-related concerns, reflecting their practical needs and psychological state during rehabilitation. Many patients with stroke are primarily concerned with improving their quality of life through daily management and care. Given the psychological pressures they face during rehabilitation, emotional support is also crucial. In contrast, experts focus on the effectiveness of rehabilitation plans, safety in technical aspects, and the dissemination of theoretical knowledge. As professionals, they are more likely to base treatment and rehabilitation plans on scientific evidence.\nThis disparity highlights the communication gap between experts and patients in health care. Patients may struggle to fully understand certain medical terms and treatment approaches, leading to confusion or anxiety about their rehabilitation plans. While experts emphasize treatment outcomes and safety, they must also consider how to effectively communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, fostering a correct understanding of rehabilitation and improving treatment adherence.\nAccording to standardized prompts, each LLM was asked to provide sources for their responses. ChatGPT-4 did not explicitly cite references, but its answers, based on its extensive training dataset, generally aligned with medical knowledge and clinical practice. In contrast, MedGo provided more detailed medical support, citing specific medical literature, treatment guidelines, and clinical studies. However, the responses from Qwen and ERNIE Bot lacked clear citations of literature and concrete clinical evidence.\nSome responses from the LLMs contained significant errors, which exposed critical safety vulnerabilities. For example, in question 3, which addressed the optimal period for stroke rehabilitation, Qwen incorrectly stated that the chronic phase of stroke begins 3 months after onset. According to various medical guidelines, the chronic phase typically starts 6 months after a stroke, making Qwen’s response inconsistent with these guidelines. Temporal misclassification may lead to premature termination of intensive therapy, reducing motor function recovery by 15%‐22% [\nAnalysis revealed that ChatGPT-4 made fewer errors, although it occasionally produced “hallucinations” due to issues with patient language expression. MedGo demonstrated high accuracy but lacked personalized care. Qwen and ERNIE Bot provided incomplete and vague responses.\nThe errors observed in the LLMs could impact patient rehabilitation to some extent. This is primarily because LLMs generate responses based on statistical language models rather than true understanding of the questions. They lack genuine comprehension and reasoning abilities. Their training depends heavily on large volumes of open-text data from the web, which does not guarantee the quality or timeliness of the answers. Medical knowledge is vast and complex, and the capabilities of LLMs vary. General-purpose LLMs struggle with specialized medical language and often lack explainability. These models are particularly prone to errors in areas such as disease diagnosis, drug effects, and emerging medical issues.\nTherefore, when addressing medical questions, especially in health care decision-making, reliance on AI models should be approached with caution. Professional medical judgment remains irreplaceable, particularly when it concerns patient health and treatment plans.\nA growing body of literature has evaluated the capabilities of LLMs across a wide range of clinical tasks, particularly in areas such as diagnosis support [\nIn contrast, LLM applications in the domain of stroke and rehabilitation have been relatively limited and primarily focused on acute care or clinical prediction tasks. For example, one recent study used GPT-4 to predict 90-day mortality in ischemic stroke management [\nFurthermore, while ChatGPT-4 has consistently demonstrated strong performance in prior research [\nAnother key distinction is our methodological framework. Many previous studies relied solely on expert judgments or automatic evaluation metrics. In contrast, our design includes both multidisciplinary expert ratings and real patient scoring, offering a dual-perspective validation framework. This approach provides ecological relevance by reflecting both clinical quality and user-perceived usefulness—dimensions often overlooked in LLM assessment [\nFinally, our findings underscore the need for task-specific, longitudinal, and patient-centered evaluation of LLMs. Future research should incorporate more diverse rehabilitation populations, integrate multilingual models (eg, Qwen-2.5Max, Gemini, and Med-Gemini), and assess user trust, emotional alignment, and practical impact over time. The creation and evaluation standards for medical LLMs must be actively developed by the medical community [\nAlthough this study provides valuable insights into the application of LLMs in home-based stroke rehabilitation health education, several limitations should be noted. First, the expert sample size was small, with only 6 experts participating in the ratings, which may have affected the comprehensiveness and representativeness of the evaluations. The interrater consistency among experts was limited. This variability may stem from several factors, including differing professional perspectives, variable familiarity with LLM outputs, and inherent subjectivity in evaluating response quality across multiple dimensions. Furthermore, some rating criteria—such as “empathy” or “clinical applicability”—may be interpreted differently by clinicians and nonclinicians. Second, to facilitate patient understanding and streamline the rating process, only a satisfaction scale was used in the second phase of interaction, resulting in a simplified rating criterion. Third, the initial question design did not sufficiently address issues related to patient emotions and adherence. These dimensions were not apparent during phase 1, when questions were primarily developed based on medical platforms and existing literature—sources that tend to focus more on clinical procedures than on psychological or behavioral needs. However, during phase 2, through patient interviews and analysis of interaction data, we recognized that emotional fluctuations and treatment adherence play a vital role in the success of home-based rehabilitation. Fourth, the broader implementation of LLMs requires careful consideration of their economic viability, feasibility, and sustainability. While this study focused primarily on the academic perspective, real-world applications must address cost-effectiveness, technological barriers, and the potential impact on health care institutions. Based on comparable systems, deploying LLMs would incur application programming interface and graphics processing unit maintenance costs, while cost savings emerge when the clinic workload is reduced. However, whether breakeven can be approached remains unknown [\nFuture research should focus on the following aspects. First, studies should consider increasing the number of expert raters within each professional subgroup to average out individual bias, standardizing scoring rubrics through iterative training, and using consensus-building techniques such as Delphi methods or calibration rounds prior to formal scoring. It may also be beneficial to incorporate mixed methods triangulation (eg, combining expert scores with patient evaluations or objective metrics) to strengthen the robustness of model performance assessments [\nThis 2-phase evaluation demonstrated that LLMs, particularly ChatGPT-4 and MedGo, show considerable promise in supporting home-based stroke rehabilitation education. ChatGPT-4 achieved the highest scores across all expert-evaluated dimensions, excelling in user-centeredness and comprehensiveness, while MedGo, a domain-specific model, produced more concise, evidence-based responses. In contrast, general purpose models such as Qwen and ERNIE Bot performed less consistently across key evaluation criteria. Notably, patients’ satisfaction ratings were lower than those of experts, highlighting potential usability challenges related to language complexity and trust in automated responses. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM-generated content with patient comprehension levels, emotional needs, and health literacy. Future work should focus on the development of hybrid models that integrate the conversational fluency of general purpose LLMs with the domain accuracy of medically trained models. Additional studies involving diverse patient populations, longitudinal designs, and real-world deployment scenarios are warranted to ensure safe, effective, and equitable integration of LLMs into patient-centered rehabilitation care.", "content_for_embedding": "Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability among middle-aged and older adult individuals worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, more than 15 million people experience a stroke annually, resulting in approximately 6 million deaths and leaving millions more with varying degrees of long-term disability [\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced, gaining significant attention in the medical and health care fields due to their advancements in natural language processing. LLMs possess powerful language comprehension and generation capabilities, enabling them to deliver personalized, easily understandable health guidance tailored to patients’ needs [\nTo address these challenges, Shanghai East Hospital developed MedGo in 2024, a specialized Chinese medical LLM designed to assist health care professionals in clinical decision-making and medical consultations. MedGo has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in medical task processing, ranking among the top models in the Chinese Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark and excelling in medical question-answering assessments [\nTo evaluate the practical effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we selected 4 representative models for comparison: ChatGPT-4, MedGo, Qwen, and ERNIE Bot. These models were chosen based on their diversity in orientation (general-purpose vs medical-specific), availability to Chinese users, and technological maturity at the time of study design. ChatGPT-4 and Qwen are general-purpose LLMs widely recognized for their advanced dialogue and multilingual capabilities. ERNIE Bot, developed by Baidu, is a leading domestic model with robust Chinese language processing. MedGo, as a medical-specific model developed within the Chinese clinical context, brings unique relevance to health care applications. This selection offers a balanced foundation for comparing the performance of LLMs in stroke rehabilitation health education.\nThe application of LLMs in the medical field is still in its early stages [\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of multiple LLMs, including specialized medical models, in supporting home rehabilitation for patients with stroke. By offering a more precise and safer rehabilitation education pathway, this research seeks to advance the application of LLMs in health care, providing a more efficient and scientifically sound solution for home rehabilitation for patients with stroke. The findings have significant academic and practical implications for promoting the adoption of LLMs in health care.\nThis study was conducted from January 5 to February 22, 2025. Using both quantitative and qualitative analyses, the study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in home-based stroke rehabilitation education.\nThis study compared 4 representative LLMs—ChatGPT-4, MedGo, Qwen-Max, and ERNIE Bot V3.5—based on their accessibility, medical relevance, and model diversity (\nNot available.\nThe study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in home-based stroke rehabilitation education. By comparing the performance of responses from 4 different LLMs and incorporating expert ratings and patient feedback [\nCommon inquiries about home rehabilitation for patients with stroke from the past 3 years were done and summarized from web-based medical platforms, including “DingXiangYuan,” “HaoDF,” “Baidu Health Ask a Doctor,” and “AliHealth.” Additionally, international stroke rehabilitation guidelines [\nUsing this feedback and incorporating the clinical experience of neurorehabilitation nursing experts, a set of 15 targeted questions and 2 common home rehabilitation case scenarios were compiled. Case 1 focused on improving limb mobility and self-care abilities in daily life, with an emphasis on blood pressure control. Case 2 addressed not only limb and gait training but also speech and swallowing rehabilitation, diabetes management, and shoulder pain relief. The questionnaire is shown in\nTo enhance the professionalism and specificity of LLM responses, ensuring that they address questions from a targeted perspective and align closely with real-world applications, a standardized prompt was added before each model-generated response. The prompt instructed the following:\n\nFifteen home rehabilitation questions and 2 clinical cases related to stroke were input into 4 different LLMs. Each model received the inputs 3 times, with each iteration conducted in a new conversation to eliminate prior chat history, allowing for an assessment of response consistency. The responses from all models were recorded in plain text format [\nA Likert 5-point rating scale was used to assess the outputs of the 4 LLMs across five dimensions: accuracy, completeness, readability, safety, and humanity. (1)\nExperts could provide brief explanations in the comment section if they had concerns about any response. The detailed definitions of the Likert 5-point rating scale are provided in\nA total of 6 stroke rehabilitation experts (\nTo minimize potential evaluator bias, all experts were blinded to the identities and affiliations of the 4 LLMs. The model outputs were anonymized and randomly ordered, with 3 independent rounds of scoring using distinct response samples in each round. Following a blind evaluation protocol, the experts assessed the outputs of the 4 LLMs across 5 dimensions. Prior to formal assessment, all experts attended a standardized training session and received a structured evaluation manual, which included detailed explanations of each scoring dimension, illustrative examples, and response interpretation guidelines. These measures aimed to promote consistent understanding of the evaluation framework and reduce interrater variability. Experts completed their assessments independently and were instructed not to communicate with one another during the scoring process. Additionally, the 6 experts conducted an interpretability analysis of the responses generated by the 4 LLMs. The expert scoring data can be found in\nThirty patients with stroke were recruited in Shanghai. The 2 top-performing models from phase 1 were selected for interaction with the patients in a real clinical setting. Each patient asked both models 3 questions related to home-based stroke rehabilitation. The researchers recorded the responses and independently rated them using a satisfaction scale. Patient questions and scoring data can be found in\n\nPatients diagnosed with stroke (including ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke) who meet the diagnostic criteria in the\nPatients in the rehabilitation phase (1‐12 months post discharge, with ongoing rehabilitation needs).\nPatients undergoing home-based rehabilitation (not long-term hospitalized).\nPatients with basic communication skills, able to express their needs accurately (or with a family member to assist in communication).\n\nPatients with severe cognitive impairments or those unable to accurately express their needs.\nPatients unable to undergo home-based rehabilitation (eg, those requiring long-term hospitalization due to the severity of their condition).\nPatients with other serious comorbidities (eg, end-stage cancer and severe heart failure) that would interfere with the rehabilitation plan.\nThe assessment criterion was patient satisfaction, based on the following specific criteria (\nPlease select the option that best reflects your overall feeling toward the model’s response.\n1 Point. Very dissatisfied: The response from the model is very unsatisfactory, completely failing to meet my needs.\n2 Points. Dissatisfied: The response from the model is unsatisfactory, with many issues, and does not meet my needs.\n3 Points. Neutral: The response from the model is acceptable; it answers some questions but still has room for improvement.\n4 Points. Satisfied: The response from the model is satisfactory, and most of the questions have been answered effectively.\n5 Points. Very satisfied: The response from the model is excellent, and all questions have been answered very well.\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 27 (IBM Corp) and R (version 4.5.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize expert and patient ratings as means, SDs, and medians. In phase 1, differences among the 4 LLMs were assessed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey Honestly Significant Difference for post hoc comparisons if normality assumptions (tested via the Shapiro-Wilk test) were met. For nonnormally distributed or heteroscedastic data, the Kruskal-Wallis H test and Mann-Whitney\nAn objective readability analysis was conducted on the responses generated by the 4 LLMs using a Chinese Readability Assessment Platform. This web-based tool [\nA one-way ANOVA was used to assess differences among the 4 LLMs in terms of word count, reading difficulty scores, and recommended reading age. Post hoc analysis was performed using Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test to examine intermodel differences. Additionally, dot plots were generated using the HIPLOT web-based tool [\nThis study was approved by the medical ethics committee of Shanghai East Hospital (approval no.: 2025YS-042). All participants provided written informed consent prior to participation. Data collected from participants were anonymized to ensure privacy and confidentiality. Participants received a small gift (approximately RMB 30 [US $4.18]) as a token of appreciation for their time and involvement, in accordance with institutional ethics guidelines. No identifiable personal information is included in the manuscript or supplementary materials (\nSix experts evaluated the responses generated by the LLMs across 5 dimensions: accuracy, comprehensiveness, readability, safety, and user-centeredness.\nAmong the models, ChatGPT-4 achieved the highest scores across all dimensions, with particularly outstanding performance in safety (mean 4.38, SD 0.81) and humanity (mean 4.65, SD 0.65). MedGo performed well in accuracy (mean 4.06, SD 0.78) and completeness (mean 4.06, SD 0.74) but was slightly inferior to ChatGPT-4 in the humanity dimension. Qwen and ERNIE Bot received significantly lower scores than both ChatGPT-4 and MedGo.\nDescriptive statistics (\nAmong the 20 scoring files, Krippendorff α values ranged from 0.26 to 0.75. A total of 14 files (14/20, 70%) demonstrated at least fair interrater agreement (α≥.50). The remaining files (6/20, 30%) fell below the 0.50 threshold, indicating lower reliability. Dimensions such as safety and humanistic care generally showed higher consistency, particularly when evaluated for ChatGPT and MedGo. In contrast, comprehensiveness ratings and responses from Qwen and ERNIE Bot yielded more variability across expert scores. Cohen κ coefficients showed substantial variation across expert subgroups: clinical physicians had fair agreement (κ=0.28), while nursing experts (κ=0.03) and rehabilitation therapists (κ=−0.13) showed poor or even negative agreement (\nNot available.\nDescriptive statistics for the objective readability analysis are shown in\nThe results of the one-way ANOVA are shown in\nA total of 30 eligible patients were recruited, generating 90 questions (\nA 2-tailed paired\nThis study evaluated the performance of ChatGPT-4, MedGo, Qwen, and ERNIE Bot in providing health education for patients with stroke undergoing home rehabilitation.\nIn phase 1, ChatGPT-4 demonstrated the best overall performance across all dimensions, excelling particularly in humanity and safety. This finding aligns with previous studies [\nIn phase 2 of patient interactions, ChatGPT-4 received higher ratings than MedGo, but overall, the ratings were lower than those given by the expert group. This discrepancy is mainly due to the challenges patients face in evaluating the models, including variations in personal understanding, needs, and the models’ performance and applicability. This is particularly evident when dealing with complex medical information. As supported by the inverse correlation between text length and satisfaction, ChatGPT-4’s detailed explanations and high reading difficulty could exceed the working memory and understanding capacity of the older adult, imposing heavy cognitive burden on them. Moreover, as artificial intelligence (AI) in medical decision-making is still developing, patients tend to be more skeptical of the models’ accuracy and reliability, often finding their responses unclear. In contrast, experts, with their accumulated knowledge and familiarity with medical terminology, are better equipped to interpret the models’ medical information, resulting in higher ratings.\nThere are significant differences in the areas of focus between patients and experts. Patients tend to prioritize rehabilitation methods, outcomes and safety, emotional support, and equipment-related concerns, reflecting their practical needs and psychological state during rehabilitation. Many patients with stroke are primarily concerned with improving their quality of life through daily management and care. Given the psychological pressures they face during rehabilitation, emotional support is also crucial. In contrast, experts focus on the effectiveness of rehabilitation plans, safety in technical aspects, and the dissemination of theoretical knowledge. As professionals, they are more likely to base treatment and rehabilitation plans on scientific evidence.\nThis disparity highlights the communication gap between experts and patients in health care. Patients may struggle to fully understand certain medical terms and treatment approaches, leading to confusion or anxiety about their rehabilitation plans. While experts emphasize treatment outcomes and safety, they must also consider how to effectively communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, fostering a correct understanding of rehabilitation and improving treatment adherence.\nAccording to standardized prompts, each LLM was asked to provide sources for their responses. ChatGPT-4 did not explicitly cite references, but its answers, based on its extensive training dataset, generally aligned with medical knowledge and clinical practice. In contrast, MedGo provided more detailed medical support, citing specific medical literature, treatment guidelines, and clinical studies. However, the responses from Qwen and ERNIE Bot lacked clear citations of literature and concrete clinical evidence.\nSome responses from the LLMs contained significant errors, which exposed critical safety vulnerabilities. For example, in question 3, which addressed the optimal period for stroke rehabilitation, Qwen incorrectly stated that the chronic phase of stroke begins 3 months after onset. According to various medical guidelines, the chronic phase typically starts 6 months after a stroke, making Qwen’s response inconsistent with these guidelines. Temporal misclassification may lead to premature termination of intensive therapy, reducing motor function recovery by 15%‐22% [\nAnalysis revealed that ChatGPT-4 made fewer errors, although it occasionally produced “hallucinations” due to issues with patient language expression. MedGo demonstrated high accuracy but lacked personalized care. Qwen and ERNIE Bot provided incomplete and vague responses.\nThe errors observed in the LLMs could impact patient rehabilitation to some extent. This is primarily because LLMs generate responses based on statistical language models rather than true understanding of the questions. They lack genuine comprehension and reasoning abilities. Their training depends heavily on large volumes of open-text data from the web, which does not guarantee the quality or timeliness of the answers. Medical knowledge is vast and complex, and the capabilities of LLMs vary. General-purpose LLMs struggle with specialized medical language and often lack explainability. These models are particularly prone to errors in areas such as disease diagnosis, drug effects, and emerging medical issues.\nTherefore, when addressing medical questions, especially in health care decision-making, reliance on AI models should be approached with caution. Professional medical judgment remains irreplaceable, particularly when it concerns patient health and treatment plans.\nA growing body of literature has evaluated the capabilities of LLMs across a wide range of clinical tasks, particularly in areas such as diagnosis support [\nIn contrast, LLM applications in the domain of stroke and rehabilitation have been relatively limited and primarily focused on acute care or clinical prediction tasks. For example, one recent study used GPT-4 to predict 90-day mortality in ischemic stroke management [\nFurthermore, while ChatGPT-4 has consistently demonstrated strong performance in prior research [\nAnother key distinction is our methodological framework. Many previous studies relied solely on expert judgments or automatic evaluation metrics. In contrast, our design includes both multidisciplinary expert ratings and real patient scoring, offering a dual-perspective validation framework. This approach provides ecological relevance by reflecting both clinical quality and user-perceived usefulness—dimensions often overlooked in LLM assessment [\nFinally, our findings underscore the need for task-specific, longitudinal, and patient-centered evaluation of LLMs. Future research should incorporate more diverse rehabilitation populations, integrate multilingual models (eg, Qwen-2.5Max, Gemini, and Med-Gemini), and assess user trust, emotional alignment, and practical impact over time. The creation and evaluation standards for medical LLMs must be actively developed by the medical community [\nAlthough this study provides valuable insights into the application of LLMs in home-based stroke rehabilitation health education, several limitations should be noted. First, the expert sample size was small, with only 6 experts participating in the ratings, which may have affected the comprehensiveness and representativeness of the evaluations. The interrater consistency among experts was limited. This variability may stem from several factors, including differing professional perspectives, variable familiarity with LLM outputs, and inherent subjectivity in evaluating response quality across multiple dimensions. Furthermore, some rating criteria—such as “empathy” or “clinical applicability”—may be interpreted differently by clinicians and nonclinicians. Second, to facilitate patient understanding and streamline the rating process, only a satisfaction scale was used in the second phase of interaction, resulting in a simplified rating criterion.
