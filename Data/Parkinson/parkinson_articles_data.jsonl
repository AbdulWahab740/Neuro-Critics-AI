Both therapies are inpatient multidisciplinary complex therapies intended to optimize functional ability, reduce disability, and improve health-related quality of life.

In contrast, type of therapy, age, sex, disease duration or stage were not significantly related to a positive ‘therapy response’ (Table S1).\nThis bicenter prospective observational study investigated the differences between user groups of two PD inpatient multidisciplinary therapies in Germany and explored whether the therapy type may impact therapy outcomes. The findings could influence referral patterns, shape the role of PD inpatient rehabilitation, and reduce morbidity.\nGCT users were significantly older and showed longer disease duration than PD-MCT users. The mean age difference of nine years is likely due to referral patterns, as GCT targets individuals with a geriatric profile [\nAs a result of GCT users’ age and disease duration [\nThe lower mobility-related quality of life in the GCT group may be explained by higher age [\nWhile many adverse characteristics in the GCT group were age-related, higher cadence and fear of falling, and poorer gait speed, fast-pace step length, lower limb function, executive functioning, and overall quality of life persisted even after age adjustment. These pronounced mobility impairments in GCT users may be due to the higher acuteness of concurrent or PD symptoms (e.g., infections or recent falls) at admission, as the Kiel GCT primarily served emergency admissions, whereas the Bochum PD-MCT had more elective admissions from a waiting list.

In addition, a relatively large proportion of data missing for reasons of feasibility under everyday inpatient conditions (participants’ unavailability or exhaustion) may have led to decreased power and precision concerning the group comparison, possibly underestimating true values of disease severity among both groups, and to distorted parameter estimations in the regression model. Further limitations pertain to the assessment measures that were restricted in multidimensionality, ability to assess durability of effects, and ecological validity. Specifically, the use of gait speed improvement as a unidimensional surrogate outcome and the absence of clinical follow-up data warrant careful interpretation of the results that may still pave the way for further research. In addition, unsupervised mobility outcomes as ecologically more valid and patient-relevant measures would have been superior to the applied supervised gait outcomes that are prone to bias (Hawthorne effect, faster PD gait under in-hospital supervision [\nGCT users are older and more severely affected than PD-MCT users, particularly in mobility impairments independent of age. No significant differences in gait speed improvement were found between the two interventions in an exploratory approach. Reducing fear of falling may enhance gait speed benefits.

Among the motor manifestations of PD, gait disturbances are notably prevalent and encompass a variety of issues, such as a shuffling gait, reduced step length and diminished automaticity, decreased arm swing, increased double support time, altered cadence, and periodic episodes such as freezing of gait (FOG) [\nGait characteristics can be examined through various methods, both in controlled and ecological settings. Recently, the use of wearable inertial sensors for gait analysis has gained considerable traction [\nStep measurement can be accomplished using either research-grade or consumer devices. Research-grade devices are specifically developed for use by professionals in research or clinical settings and are generally recognized for their superior accuracy and reliability [\nPD poses a unique challenge for gait analysis, as its associated disturbed gait patterns could adversely impact the reliability of device algorithms. Furthermore, the occurrence of tremors and dyskinesias in patients with PD may introduce additional background noise in recordings, potentially resulting in an overestimation of step counts [\nIn our previous in-laboratory study involving 47 people with PD, we demonstrated a good criterion validity (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.76) and an acceptable level of error (mean absolute percentage error=5%) in step counting using a consumer smartwatch (Garmin Vivosmart 4), when worn on the side least affected by the disease and under well-controlled pharmacological conditions [\nAn essential additional metrological characteristic of an activity monitor is its capability to reliably capture changes in measured parameters and the clinical significance of these changes. In this context, the minimum detectable change (MDC) and the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) are 2 key metrics and are pivotal for calculating clinical trial sample sizes and assessing the effectiveness of interventions [\nAnchor-based methods compare the change in patients’ variable of interest with how patients score on a second, explicit metric of improvement (ie, the anchor) [\nAs of now, there are no published studies that have evaluated the MCID for avDS in people with PD. Therefore, considering these identified research gaps and the clinical significance of the psychometric and clinometric properties of daily steps measured by consumer smartwatches in free-living conditions for people with PD, the objective of this study was to determine the MCID of avDS as recorded by a consumer smartwatch in real-world settings for this population of individuals.\nParticipants were recruited at the Movement Disorder Outpatient Service of the Sant’Andrea University Hospital, Rome, Italy, in the period between March 2023 and February 2024. Inclusion criteria were (1) diagnosis of idiopathic PD according to Movement Disorder Society criteria [\nThis cross-sectional study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Approval was granted by the local Ethical Committee of Sapienza, University of Rome (Reference 0372/2022). Data collection and processing followed the current European regulation for data protection. All participants provided written informed consent (\nParticipants were evaluated during scheduled visits. Demographics (age and sex) and anthropometric measures (weight, height, and BMI) were collected. Disease duration, disease stage according to the mHY scale, and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) [\nThe sum of the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) [\nParticipants then received the smartwatch Garmin Vivosmart 4 to be worn at home for 5 consecutive days, including at least 1 weekend day, on the wrist of the body side least affected by the disease [\nAfter 5 days, they returned the smartwatch to the hospital. From the smartwatch dashboard, the total daily number of steps for each day was recorded, and the avDS were calculated [\nThe statistical analyses were performed using JASP v0.18.3.0 (JASP Team, University of Amsterdam), R v4.0.3 (R Core Team), and RStudio v2022.07.1+554 for Windows (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Descriptive statistics were calculated for the examined variables. Normality of distributions was assessed by histogram and residual plots inspection.\nTo define MCID, we used an anchor-based method identifying three levels of variables, following the approach of Motl and collaborators [\nSuch an approach could provide ranges of MCIDs and options for MCID selection that are appropriate for specific populations and circumstances, including both assessor-based and PROs, in clinical trials and interventions involving people with PD [\nSince previous studies have recommended a correlation coefficient of at least 0.3‐0.35 between the change score and the anchor [\nWe then conducted a linear regression between avDS and MDS-UPDRS part I+II and part III, mHY, SPPB, LEDD, and age for estimating the incremental change in daily steps per relevant variable change. To evaluate the relevant change, we used the already known MCID for each scale included in the regression analysis. Scales for which an MCID was not reported were excluded from the analysis. In case of asymmetric MCID (ie, different values for improvement and deterioration), we used the average value rounded to the higher next whole number.\nFor the remaining variables, we calculated mean and SE differences in avDS between groups by performing between-subjects ANOVA with Bonferroni-Holm post hoc pairwise comparisons in case of overall significance, when the variables included more than 2 classes. For 2-class variables, we used the Student\nA total of 100 people with PD were enrolled in the study. All participants were monitored through Garmin Vivosmart 4 at home for a period of 5 consecutive days. No participants or days were excluded based on the prespecified compliance criteria. Participants took on average 5949 (SD 3034) daily steps, ranging from 357 to 12620.

The 2 linear regression models between avDS and MDS-UPDRS-III and SPPB were statistically significant (MDS-UPDRS-III:\nThe resulting regression equations indicated that every 1-point increase in MDS-UPDRS-III corresponded to a 152 steps/day decrease (avDS=9778−152×MDS-UPDRS-III). MCID for MDS-UPDRS was reported as 3.25 for score decrease and 4.63 for score increase [\nAll included variables except BMI showed a correlation coefficient >0.3 with avDS. Regression models of mHY, LEDD, age, and disease duration were statistically significant (mHY:\nThe resulting regression equations indicated that every 1-point increase in mHY stage yielded a reduction of 2607 steps/day (avDS=11,409−2607×mHY). Since mHY included 0.5 steps increases between scores 1 and 3, we calculated that each step corresponded to a 1304 steps/day reduction.\nFor LEDD, regression equations indicated that every 1 equivalent mg increase led to a reduction of 3.5 steps/day (avDS=7846−3.5×mHY). Since the usual single dose of levodopa corresponds to 100 mg, we used this value as a reference, and we estimated a 350 steps/day modification for each 100 mg change in LEDD.\nFor age, regression equations indicated that a 1-year increase in age yielded a reduction of 141 steps/day (avDS=15,512−141×age). Furthermore, 10-year increases are usually used to divide participants in age groups; therefore, we estimated a 1410-step/day modification for each 10-year change of age.\nFor disease duration, regression equations indicated that a 1-year increase in disease duration resulted in a reduction of 180 steps/day (avDS=7071−180×age). We chose 5 years as a significant increment in disease duration since this was a common cutoff to categorize disease duration in previous studies [\nConsidering categorical descriptors, ANOVA showed a significant difference in avDS among participants with TD, PIGD, and indeterminate participants (\nThe Student\nNo significant differences were found between males and females (\nOverall, the mean MCID across the clinical and health-related variables was 1200 steps/day (range 350‐1683), corresponding to 20% of the avDS in our population.\nOnly MDS-UPDRS I+II showed a correlation coefficient >0.3 with avDS and was included in the regression analysis. Regression models of MDS-UPDRS part I+II were statistically significant (MDS-UPDRS I+II:\nFor MDS-UPDRS I+II, regression equations indicated that every 1-point increase led to a reduction of 99 steps/day (avDS=7188−99×MDS-UPDRS I+II). For the sum of MDS-UPDRS I and II, the reported MCID is 5.73 points for improvement and 4.70 points for worsening; therefore, we calculated a rounded average of 6 points, and we estimated a 594 steps/day modification for each 6-point change in MDS-UPDRS I+II.\nThe Student\nNo significant differences were found in avDS between participants with and without FOG (\nOverall, the mean MCID across the disease-related PROs variables was 1592 steps/day (range 594‐2589), corresponding to 27% of the avDS in our population.\nThe 3 calculated MCIDs, as well as the anchors and the avDS modification related to anchors significant changes, are reported in\navDS: average daily steps.\nMCID: minimal clinically important difference.\nMDS-UPDRS: Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale.\nSPPB: Short Physical Performance Battery.\nmHY: modified Hoehn and Yahr scale.\nLEDD: levodopa equivalent daily dose.\nTD: tremor dominant.\nPIGD: postural instability and gait disorder.\nIND: indeterminate.\nPRO: patient-reported outcome.\nIn this cross-sectional study, we aimed to calculate, for the first time, the MCID for avDS as an indicator of free-living walking behavior in people with PD using a consumer smartwatch under real-world conditions. We identified 3 distinct levels of MCID for avDS. The first level, of around 580 steps/day, is anchored to standardized measures of motor symptoms and mobility. The second level, of around 1200 steps/day, is based on clinical and health-related variables. Finally, the third level, of around 1590 steps/day, is anchored on disease-related PROs.\nGlobally, the MCID values ranged from 581 to 1592 steps/day, representing 10%‐27% of the average in our study population. We used the method used by Motl and colleagues [\nOur results suggest that a value of around 580 steps/day might reflect the smallest clinically meaningful change in avDS when measured by a consumer smartwatch and should be considered when designing a study including interventions focused on mobility or motor condition improvement. Differently, when global disease and health status are the main outcomes, our results showed that a larger value of around 1200 steps/day might be considered to define a clinically meaningful change.\nIn the last decades, a growing importance has been attributed to PROs, such as patient-reported scales, quality of life questionnaires, etc, as vital indicators of people’s perception of their own condition [\nIt is also vital to consider the feasibility of achieving changes in avDS of the magnitudes identified in this study. Previous research has explored interventions in people with PD that use daily steps as an outcome measure [\nNevertheless, the capability of consumer devices to accurately detect changes of the magnitude reported here is crucial for their clinical utility. In a recent study of ours, we found that for a monitoring duration of at least 4 days, the MDC for the Garmin Vivosmart 4 ranged between 1198 and 1524 steps/day, averaging at 1366 steps/day [\nWe recognize certain limitations in our study. First, the people with PD included in our study displayed relatively high levels of physical capacity, as evidenced by a median SPPB score of 10 (IQR 9-12), and adequate cognitive functions, due to our exclusion of participants with a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score below 21. In addition, those with more advanced disease stages or requiring walking aids were not part of our study group. This selection criterion potentially limits the generalizability of our findings to only mild-to-moderate people with PD. Indeed, in a population of individuals with worse cognitive and motor conditions, we might expect lower accuracy and reliability of avDS estimates by smartwatches and fewer steps/day due to greater walking impairments [\nIn addition, while we incorporated a range of general and disease-specific measurements, other factors that might affect daily life mobility, such as fear of falling, frontal executive cognitive dysfunction, and objectively measured gait parameters (eg, gait speed, cadence, and step length), were not examined. Furthermore, specific subdomains of adopted measurement tools could be further explored (eg, walking speed or balance subitems of SPPB and PIGD subscore of MDS-UPDRS part III). Further studies exploring the relationship between these factors and smartwatch-recordable parameters are recommended to provide a more comprehensive understanding of mobility in people with PD.\nIn addition, we did not extract the raw data from the smartwatches, but used the information reported by the device’s dashboard. While acknowledging the technical limitations of this approach, we designed the study to mimic as closely as possible the actual use of the device in a real-world context and to use parameters as similar as possible to those that a general user would have access to. Finally, in this work, we used an anchor-based cross-sectional method to define different levels of MCID as presented by Motl et al [\nWe reported 3 levels of MCID for avDS measured through Garmin Vivosmart 4, for 5 consecutive days, 1 of approximately 580 steps/day (or about 10% of our population’s average), anchored to standardized measures of motor symptoms and mobility. A second, of around 1200 steps/day (or about 20% of the mean in our population), anchored to clinical and health-related variables. Finally, a third, or around 1590 steps/day (or about 27% of the mean in our population) anchored to disease-related PROs. Considering that the previously reported MCD for Garmin Vivosmart 4 was 1366 steps/day, this indicates that any observed change exceeding this threshold is not only beyond the realm of measurement error but also clinically meaningful. Furthermore, based on previous studies, we could suppose that achieving changes comparable with the smaller MCID identified in our study might be feasible following interventions aimed at promoting physical activity in people with PD. These findings, together with existing evidence for reliability and validity on consumer smartwatches, could be relevant for designing future clinical trials involving avDS as an outcome measure of real-world walking behavior in PD, and evaluating the effectiveness of intervention promoting free-living walking.", "content_for_embedding": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by both motor and nonmotor symptoms. Among the motor manifestations of PD, gait disturbances are notably prevalent and encompass a variety of issues, such as a shuffling gait, reduced step length and diminished automaticity, decreased arm swing, increased double support time, altered cadence, and periodic episodes such as freezing of gait (FOG) [\nGait characteristics can be examined through various methods, both in controlled and ecological settings. Recently, the use of wearable inertial sensors for gait analysis has gained considerable traction [\nStep measurement can be accomplished using either research-grade or consumer devices. Research-grade devices are specifically developed for use by professionals in research or clinical settings and are generally recognized for their superior accuracy and reliability [\nPD poses a unique challenge for gait analysis, as its associated disturbed gait patterns could adversely impact the reliability of device algorithms. Furthermore, the occurrence of tremors and dyskinesias in patients with PD may introduce additional background noise in recordings, potentially resulting in an overestimation of step counts [\nIn our previous in-laboratory study involving 47 people with PD, we demonstrated a good criterion validity (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.76) and an acceptable level of error (mean absolute percentage error=5%) in step counting using a consumer smartwatch (Garmin Vivosmart 4), when worn on the side least affected by the disease and under well-controlled pharmacological conditions [\nAn essential additional metrological characteristic of an activity monitor is its capability to reliably capture changes in measured parameters and the clinical significance of these changes. In this context, the minimum detectable change (MDC) and the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) are 2 key metrics and are pivotal for calculating clinical trial sample sizes and assessing the effectiveness of interventions [\nAnchor-based methods compare the change in patients’ variable of interest with how patients score on a second, explicit metric of improvement (ie, the anchor) [\nAs of now, there are no published studies that have evaluated the MCID for avDS in people with PD. Therefore, considering these identified research gaps and the clinical significance of the psychometric and clinometric properties of daily steps measured by consumer smartwatches in free-living conditions for people with PD, the objective of this study was to determine the MCID of avDS as recorded by a consumer smartwatch in real-world settings for this population of individuals.\nParticipants were recruited at the Movement Disorder Outpatient Service of the Sant’Andrea University Hospital, Rome, Italy, in the period between March 2023 and February 2024. Inclusion criteria were (1) diagnosis of idiopathic PD according to Movement Disorder Society criteria [\nThis cross-sectional study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Approval was granted by the local Ethical Committee of Sapienza, University of Rome (Reference 0372/2022). Data collection and processing followed the current European regulation for data protection. All participants provided written informed consent (\nParticipants were evaluated during scheduled visits. Demographics (age and sex) and anthropometric measures (weight, height, and BMI) were collected. Disease duration, disease stage according to the mHY scale, and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) [\nThe sum of the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) [\nParticipants then received the smartwatch Garmin Vivosmart 4 to be worn at home for 5 consecutive days, including at least 1 weekend day, on the wrist of the body side least affected by the disease [\nAfter 5 days, they returned the smartwatch to the hospital. From the smartwatch dashboard, the total daily number of steps for each day was recorded, and the avDS were calculated [\nThe statistical analyses were performed using JASP v0.18.3.0 (JASP Team, University of Amsterdam), R v4.0.3 (R Core Team), and RStudio v2022.07.1+554 for Windows (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Descriptive statistics were calculated for the examined variables. Normality of distributions was assessed by histogram and residual plots inspection.\nTo define MCID, we used an anchor-based method identifying three levels of variables, following the approach of Motl and collaborators [\nSuch an approach could provide ranges of MCIDs and options for MCID selection that are appropriate for specific populations and circumstances, including both assessor-based and PROs, in clinical trials and interventions involving people with PD [\nSince previous studies have recommended a correlation coefficient of at least 0.3‐0.35 between the change score and the anchor [\nWe then conducted a linear regression between avDS and MDS-UPDRS part I+II and part III, mHY, SPPB, LEDD, and age for estimating the incremental change in daily steps per relevant variable change. To evaluate the relevant change, we used the already known MCID for each scale included in the regression analysis. Scales for which an MCID was not reported were excluded from the analysis. In case of asymmetric MCID (ie, different values for improvement and deterioration), we used the average value rounded to the higher next whole number.\nFor the remaining variables, we calculated mean and SE differences in avDS between groups by performing between-subjects ANOVA with Bonferroni-Holm post hoc pairwise comparisons in case of overall significance, when the variables included more than 2 classes. For 2-class variables, we used the Student\nA total of 100 people with PD were enrolled in the study. All participants were monitored through Garmin Vivosmart 4 at home for a period of 5 consecutive days. No participants or days were excluded based on the prespecified compliance criteria. Participants took on average 5949 (SD 3034) daily steps, ranging from 357 to 12620.

The 2 linear regression models between avDS and MDS-UPDRS-III and SPPB were statistically significant (MDS-UPDRS-III:\nThe resulting regression equations indicated that every 1-point increase in MDS-UPDRS-III corresponded to a 152 steps/day decrease (avDS=9778−152×MDS-UPDRS-III). MCID for MDS-UPDRS was reported as 3.25 for score decrease and 4.63 for score increase [\nAll included variables except BMI showed a correlation coefficient >0.3 with avDS. Regression models of mHY, LEDD, age, and disease duration were statistically significant (mHY:\nThe resulting regression equations indicated that every 1-point increase in mHY stage yielded a reduction of 2607 steps/day (avDS=11,409−2607×mHY). Since mHY included 0.5 steps increases between scores 1 and 3, we calculated that each step corresponded to a 1304 steps/day reduction.\nFor LEDD, regression equations indicated that every 1 equivalent mg increase led to a reduction of 3.5 steps/day (avDS=7846−3.5×mHY). Since the usual single dose of levodopa corresponds to 100 mg, we used this value as a reference, and we estimated a 350 steps/day modification for each 100 mg change in LEDD.\nFor age, regression equations indicated that a 1-year increase in age yielded a reduction of 141 steps/day (avDS=15,512−141×age). Furthermore, 10-year increases are usually used to divide participants in age groups; therefore, we estimated a 1410-step/day modification for each 10-year change of age.\nFor disease duration, regression equations indicated that a 1-year increase in disease duration resulted in a reduction of 180 steps/day (avDS=7071−180×age). We chose 5 years as a significant increment in disease duration since this was a common cutoff to categorize disease duration in previous studies [\nConsidering categorical descriptors, ANOVA showed a significant difference in avDS among participants with TD, PIGD, and indeterminate participants (\nThe Student\nNo significant differences were found between males and females (\nOverall, the mean MCID across the clinical and health-related variables was 1200 steps/day (range 350‐1683), corresponding to 20% of the avDS in our population.\nOnly MDS-UPDRS I+II showed a correlation coefficient >0.3 with avDS and was included in the regression analysis.

For the sum of MDS-UPDRS I and II, the reported MCID is 5.73 points for improvement and 4.70 points for worsening; therefore, we calculated a rounded average of 6 points, and we estimated a 594 steps/day modification for each 6-point change in MDS-UPDRS I+II.\nThe Student\nNo significant differences were found in avDS between participants with and without FOG (\nOverall, the mean MCID across the disease-related PROs variables was 1592 steps/day (range 594‐2589), corresponding to 27% of the avDS in our population.\nThe 3 calculated MCIDs, as well as the anchors and the avDS modification related to anchors significant changes, are reported in\navDS: average daily steps.\nMCID: minimal clinically important difference.\nMDS-UPDRS: Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale.\nSPPB: Short Physical Performance Battery.\nmHY: modified Hoehn and Yahr scale.\nLEDD: levodopa equivalent daily dose.\nTD: tremor dominant.\nPIGD: postural instability and gait disorder.\nIND: indeterminate.\nPRO: patient-reported outcome.\nIn this cross-sectional study, we aimed to calculate, for the first time, the MCID for avDS as an indicator of free-living walking behavior in people with PD using a consumer smartwatch under real-world conditions. We identified 3 distinct levels of MCID for avDS. The first level, of around 580 steps/day, is anchored to standardized measures of motor symptoms and mobility. The second level, of around 1200 steps/day, is based on clinical and health-related variables. Finally, the third level, of around 1590 steps/day, is anchored on disease-related PROs.\nGlobally, the MCID values ranged from 581 to 1592 steps/day, representing 10%‐27% of the average in our study population.

Here, we studied neural oscillations in the VIM and their coupling to cortical oscillations during voluntary movement.\nWe investigated thalamo-cortical coupling, combining recordings of thalamic local field potentials and magnetoencephalography, in 10 ET patients with externalized deep brain stimulation electrodes. During the recording, patients repeatedly pressed a button in response to a visual cue. In a whole-brain analysis of VIM-cortex coherence, we contrasted activity during pre-movement baseline and button pressing.\nButton pressing was associated with a bilateral decrease of thalamic alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (13–21 Hz) power and a contralateral gamma (35–90 Hz) power increase. Alpha/low-beta (8–20 Hz) coherence decreased during movement. This effect localized to the supplementary motor area and premotor cortex. A high-beta (21–35 Hz) coherence increase occurred in the same region but was more focal than the suppression.

The LFPs were referenced to a mastoid reference. MEG signals were recorded by a 306-channel MEG system (Vectorview, MEGIN) with a sampling rate of 2 kHz. Moreover, we measured electromyograms (EMGs) from both forearms (extensor digitorum communis and flexor digitorum communis), accelerometer signals from both index fingers, and vertical and horizontal electrooculograms (for a detailed analysis of eye movements see Supplementary Fig. 3).\nThe experiment included the button press task, which followed a resting state recording (\nDuring the motor task, a button box was placed on a table in front of the patients. Upon the presentation of a visual cue, presented on a screen in front of them, patients pressed a button with either the left or the right index finger. Each trial started with a black fixation cross that was presented between 6–8 s, followed by a Go cue (green cross). Pressing the button started the next trial. The task was performed in blocks of 8 min and each patient completed 1–3 blocks. Each block was divided equally into a left-hand and a right-hand part, and started with a short video indicating which index finger to use first.

For this purpose, we calculated pre-movement coherence (−0.5 to 0.5 s relative to the Go cue) in the alpha/low-beta (8–20 Hz) and in the high beta (21–35 Hz) band and correlated it with reaction time.

This aspect is relevant to the search for electrophysiological biomarkers of movement disorders, highlighting the need to distinguish between disease-specific and movement-specific markers.\nHere, we reproduced previous findings on modulations of thalamic activity during voluntary movements.(\nThe apparent divergence between the dynamics of low- and high-beta activity matches findings in Parkinson’s disease indicating distinct roles of low- and high-beta activity (\nMotor cortical power largely resembled VIM power, but, in contrast to the VIM, motor cortex did not reveal a strong beta rebound in this paradigm. However, a weak rebound was visible in the hemisphere contralateral to movement when the spectral modulations were related to the time when the button was released (Supplementary Fig. 2). This finding suggests a differential response of the thalamus and motor cortex to elements of the motor sequence.\nVIM-cortex coupling followed a similar pattern as VIM power: alpha-/low-beta coherence decreased prior to and throughout the button press, and high-beta coherence increased after the button press. The decrease of alpha-/low-beta coherence has been reported before for externally paced (\nCompared to baseline, high-beta coupling between cortex and the VIM contralateral to movement increased shortly after the button press. This effect was strongest in similar regions as the preceding 8–20 Hz decrease, but more focal. The coherence increase might be analogous to the post-movement rebound of beta power that is typically observed in sensorimotor cortex (\nPre-movement levels of 8–20 Hz VIM-motor cortex coherence in the contralateral hemisphere correlated positively with reaction time, i.e. higher coupling around Go cue onset were associated with slower responses. These findings tally with the proposed antikinetic nature of low-beta oscillations, derived mainly from studies on Parkinson’s disease. These studies have established a relationship between elevated beta power in the STN and the severity of bradykinesia and rigidity (\nInterestingly, other pre-movement features of thalamic activity have likewise been linked to reaction time.

Almost twenty years ago, large prospective epidemiological studies began to demonstrate that prudent dietary patterns—rich in fruit, vegetables, and fish—were inversely associated with PD risk, whereas Western dietary patterns were associated with an increased risk of a subsequent PD diagnosis [\nBased on observations in Crete and southern Italy, the MEDI diet was first formally described by Ancel Keys in 1970 as being associated with lower rates of coronary heart disease [\nThe MIND diet was developed by combining elements of the MEDI and DASH diets, and was designed for cognitive health [\nWhile MEDI and MIND diets are well-defined and have available strategies for addressing adherence, none have been optimized for PD; they were developed with other primary health goals in mind and were only later tested in PD populations. Most concerning, individual dietary components within these diets are at odds with PD-specific research (e.g., they include dairy), and only a handful of variables drive most of the observed effects. With the MEDI diet, sofrito was associated with worse PRO-PD scores over time, although this was not statistically significant. Only the following four variables were statistically associated with improved outcomes: less than one sweet or carbonated beverage per day; three or more servings of nuts per week; less than one serving per day of red meat; and two or more vegetable servings per day, including one raw or as a salad. In the MIND diet, however, the inclusion of poultry was associated with non-statistically significant worse PRO-PD outcomes, with the following variables meeting statistical significance: frequently eating nuts, green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, and berries, and avoiding cheese, red meat, butter, and margarine [\nWhile the MEDI and MIND diets have demonstrated promising associations with improved PD outcomes, neither was explicitly developed or optimized for PD populations. Notably, these diets include components that conflict with PD-specific research and only a subset of their variables appear to drive most of the observed benefits. To address this gap, the present work introduced the PRO diet, a curated set of dietary criteria that were derived from the MVP dataset and designed to optimize patient-reported outcomes. This composite adherence scale offers a targeted tool for patients, providers, and researchers seeking to advance nutritional strategies that meaningfully impact PD’s trajectory.\nInspired by the positive deviance research model, the MVP study was designed as a pragmatic, prospective, and internet-based observational study, designed to describe the behaviors and habits associated with patient-centered symptoms of severity. With the protected time and support afforded by the National Institutes of Health K01-ATT004404; the Career Transition Award; the didactic training in patient-centered outcomes; and nutritional and neuro-epidemiology support from the Bastyr University and the University of Washington School of Public Health, respectively, the MVP project was designed to be a purely pragmatic and patient-centered approach for identifying the positive deviants with PD. The study has sent out two surveys per year to the study participants. Participants are recruited online, during lectures, at local support groups, and at conferences, where possible. Attempts have been made to reach underserved communities, including rural America and others globally. Detailed recruitment methods have been described in prior publications. A wide variety of incomes are represented, although this cohort is disproportionately white and highly educated [\nThe primary outcome measures of PD severity and progression in the MVP study are the patient-reported outcomes in PD (PRO-PD), a validated, continuous outcome measure, designed to quantify global symptom severity in individuals with PD. The PRO-PD quantifies the subjective user experience across 33 common motor and non-motor PD symptoms. All symptoms are rated on a slider from 0 (not present) to 100 (severe). The total PRO-PD score is the sum of these individual symptom scores, yielding a composite score ranging from 0 to 3300, with higher scores indicating a greater overall symptom burden. Unlike traditional clinician-administered rating scales, the PRO-PD is self-reported and emphasizes non-motor symptoms that frequently precede motor decline, making it especially useful for capturing early disease progression.\nThe goal was to develop a diet based on optimized PRO-PD scores, which lacks the ceiling effect seen in MIND and MEDI diets, has all variables individually associated with better PD outcomes, and provides a path to fewer PD symptoms compared to the MEDI and MIND diet adherence. To derive the dietary pattern most strongly associated with slowed PD progression, we conducted a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of all the available food frequency and binary dietary variables in the MVP dataset. The variables were grouped and tested to evaluate the dose–response relationships with symptom trajectories, using PRO-PD scores as the primary outcome. Variables were retained based on their individual and cumulative predictive power for slower symptom accumulation over time. This modeling process ultimately yielded a 21-point adherence scale—the PRO-21 diet score—comprising the foods and dietary behaviors most consistently associated with favorable long-term outcomes. The scoring system reflects both the inclusion and exclusion of items associated with faster progression.\nThe final 21-variable PRO-21 diet score was developed based on the components most strongly and consistently associated with slower progression on the PRO-PD scale. The score awards one point for each of the following 10 positive behaviors: consuming adequate amounts of nuts and seeds (½ cup or 2 Tbsp of spread per day); olive oil (≥1 Tbsp/day); fresh fruit (≥1 cup/day); fresh vegetables (≥1½ cups/day); seafood (fish or shellfish ≥ 2 times/week); red wine (≥2 servings/week); coffee (≥2 cups/day); the liberal use of spices; cooking at home; and buying organically grown food. Additional points were awarded for complete or near-complete avoidance (i.e., less than once per month) of the following 11 items: dairy (from animal sources); pork; beef; chicken; fried food; soda (regular and diet); refined grains (bread and pasta); juice; sugar; artificial sweeteners (e.g., aspartame, acesulfame K, and saccharin); and eating from a can (\nTo test the validity of the newly established PRO diet, the MIND, MEDI, and PRO diet scores were computed and compared at baseline. The subsequent slope of progression was plotted based on the baseline scores. Only individuals with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD (N = 2290) were used in this analysis; individuals reporting Parkinson-plus syndromes or other forms of parkinsonism were dropped from the analysis. Baseline distributions were illustrated and each score was modeled using linear regression models, adjusting for age, sex, income, and years since diagnosis.\nThe validated MIND and MEDI [\nThe Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) model was used to compare how well the different statistical models fitted the dataset. It balances the goodness of fit and simplicity, with a lower AIC, meaning a better balance between fit and simplicity. To validate the model’s performance, AIC values across the MEDI, MIND, and PRO dietary adherence scores were compared.\nCross-validation (CV) was conducted to evaluate the generalizability of each model beyond the development dataset. While the AIC assesses model fit within a given sample, it does not account for potential overfitting or generalizability, or for predictive performance on new data. CV estimates model stability across multiple simulated subsamples. Robust error metrics—the Root Median Squared Error (RMdSE) and Median Absolute Error (MedAE)—were selected to minimize the influence of outliers. CV was performed using 100 randomly generated subsamples, each comprising 30% of the dataset.\nA univariate analysis was conducted to examine the associations between the individual PRO diet score components and PD outcomes, unadjusted and adjusted for age, gender, income, and years since diagnosis. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.2.1 and RStudio version 2024.12.0.\nOf the 2788 participants enrolled in the study, 2290 reporting a diagnosis of PD were included in the analysis (\nThe models tested whether any of the diets were associated with PRO-PD scores after adjusting for age, gender, income, and years since diagnosis. In all three models, dietary adherence demonstrated a significant inverse association with PRO-PD outcomes (MEDI: β = −64, 95% CI −78 to −51,\nThe PRO-21 diet model demonstrated an improved statistical fit relative to the MEDI and MIND diet models, with AIC values that were 1397 and 1282 points lower, respectively (\nThe cross-validation results (\nThe data show that dairy abstention was the least commonly achieved PRO component, with only a small number of participants receiving this point (\nIn adjusted models, all PRO-21 components were independently associated with lower PRO-PD symptom scores, an a priori requirement for inclusion in the diet. The largest absolute estimates were observed among the participants with a high adherence to vegetable intake, home cooking, and dairy avoidance. While most components retained statistician significance after adjustment, refined grains, pork, and canned food showed attenuated associations, indicating variability in the strength of individual dietary predictors. These results suggest that certain dietary behaviors may be more strongly aligned with symptom burden than others, even within an overall adherence framework (\nTo evaluate whether adherence to PRO-21 was related to the subsequent rate of PD progression, time slope estimates were assigned to four categories of adherence: 0–5, 6–9, 10–14, and 15+ (\nBecause statistical significance does not necessarily equate to clinical relevance,\nAcross all the dietary models, years since diagnosis, income, and diet were significant predictors of PRO-PD outcomes, while age and gender did not impact the results.

While the MIND diet may offer short-term symptomatic benefit (\nOver the past three decades, dairy intake has emerged as a consistent dietary factor associated with increased PD risk [\nThe PRO diet model was stronger when two glasses of wine per week and two cups of coffee per day were included, which was congruent with a large body of traditional epidemiological data demonstrating that coffee and alcohol are associated with a decreased risk of diagnosis [\nThe liberal intake of olive oil and nuts is also congruent with traditional epidemiological data in PD [\nAs evidence linking diet to PD risk and symptom burden continues to accumulate, building accessible, evidence-informed dietary guidance for both patients and providers will be essential to ensure that recommendations are scientifically grounded but also practical, personalized, and supportive of long-term adherence. Dietary training programs and online resources for patients and providers are likely to be developed over time, as the demand is recognized.\nPatients should be taught that all variables are associated with improvement, and they should start with what feels most attainable. While PRO-21 adherence scores above 15 surpassed what the MIND and MEDI diets seemed capable of statistically, fewer than 5% of participants reached that threshold. Replacing dairy-based butter with olive oil, adding cinnamon and apple to oatmeal, and eating celery dipped in peanut butter are examples of easy, affordable strategies to gain additional points. Nutritional medicine practitioners are encouraged to develop handouts (\nThe PRO-21 diet consistently outperformed the MIND and MEDI diets in the model fit, as indicated by its substantially lower AIC values across motor, non-motor, and total PD symptoms. This superior statistical fit emerged despite PRO-21 showing smaller per-symptom effect sizes, suggesting it captures meaningful variance in disease outcomes beyond the ceiling effects observed in MIND and MEDI adherence scores. However, PRO-21’s rigorous adherence demands may introduce new barriers, including increased patient frustration, stress, and feasibility concerns, both for individuals and providers. Achieving high PRO-21 adherence (scores of 15+) may come with challenges related to cost, accessibility, dietary satisfaction, and long-term sustainability, which have yet to be studied. Intervention trials are necessary to test the feasibility, adherence potential, side effects (including the financial and psychological burdens), and real-world impact of PRO-21 compared to the MIND and MEDI diets.", "content_for_embedding": "Dietary interventions are of great interest because of their potential to modify the symptoms and trajectory of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Almost twenty years ago, large prospective epidemiological studies began to demonstrate that prudent dietary patterns—rich in fruit, vegetables, and fish—were inversely associated with PD risk, whereas Western dietary patterns were associated with an increased risk of a subsequent PD diagnosis [\nBased on observations in Crete and southern Italy, the MEDI diet was first formally described by Ancel Keys in 1970 as being associated with lower rates of coronary heart disease [\nThe MIND diet was developed by combining elements of the MEDI and DASH diets, and was designed for cognitive health [\nWhile MEDI and MIND diets are well-defined and have available strategies for addressing adherence, none have been optimized for PD; they were developed with other primary health goals in mind and were only later tested in PD populations. Most concerning, individual dietary components within these diets are at odds with PD-specific research (e.g., they include dairy), and only a handful of variables drive most of the observed effects. With the MEDI diet, sofrito was associated with worse PRO-PD scores over time, although this was not statistically significant. Only the following four variables were statistically associated with improved outcomes: less than one sweet or carbonated beverage per day; three or more servings of nuts per week; less than one serving per day of red meat; and two or more vegetable servings per day, including one raw or as a salad. In the MIND diet, however, the inclusion of poultry was associated with non-statistically significant worse PRO-PD outcomes, with the following variables meeting statistical significance: frequently eating nuts, green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, and berries, and avoiding cheese, red meat, butter, and margarine [\nWhile the MEDI and MIND diets have demonstrated promising associations with improved PD outcomes, neither was explicitly developed or optimized for PD populations. Notably, these diets include components that conflict with PD-specific research and only a subset of their variables appear to drive most of the observed benefits. To address this gap, the present work introduced the PRO diet, a curated set of dietary criteria that were derived from the MVP dataset and designed to optimize patient-reported outcomes. This composite adherence scale offers a targeted tool for patients, providers, and researchers seeking to advance nutritional strategies that meaningfully impact PD’s trajectory.\nInspired by the positive deviance research model, the MVP study was designed as a pragmatic, prospective, and internet-based observational study, designed to describe the behaviors and habits associated with patient-centered symptoms of severity. With the protected time and support afforded by the National Institutes of Health K01-ATT004404; the Career Transition Award; the didactic training in patient-centered outcomes; and nutritional and neuro-epidemiology support from the Bastyr University and the University of Washington School of Public Health, respectively, the MVP project was designed to be a purely pragmatic and patient-centered approach for identifying the positive deviants with PD. The study has sent out two surveys per year to the study participants. Participants are recruited online, during lectures, at local support groups, and at conferences, where possible. Attempts have been made to reach underserved communities, including rural America and others globally. Detailed recruitment methods have been described in prior publications. A wide variety of incomes are represented, although this cohort is disproportionately white and highly educated [\nThe primary outcome measures of PD severity and progression in the MVP study are the patient-reported outcomes in PD (PRO-PD), a validated, continuous outcome measure, designed to quantify global symptom severity in individuals with PD. The PRO-PD quantifies the subjective user experience across 33 common motor and non-motor PD symptoms. All symptoms are rated on a slider from 0 (not present) to 100 (severe). The total PRO-PD score is the sum of these individual symptom scores, yielding a composite score ranging from 0 to 3300, with higher scores indicating a greater overall symptom burden. Unlike traditional clinician-administered rating scales, the PRO-PD is self-reported and emphasizes non-motor symptoms that frequently precede motor decline, making it especially useful for capturing early disease progression.\nThe goal was to develop a diet based on optimized PRO-PD scores, which lacks the ceiling effect seen in MIND and MEDI diets, has all variables individually associated with better PD outcomes, and provides a path to fewer PD symptoms compared to the MEDI and MIND diet adherence. To derive the dietary pattern most strongly associated with slowed PD progression, we conducted a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of all the available food frequency and binary dietary variables in the MVP dataset. The variables were grouped and tested to evaluate the dose–response relationships with symptom trajectories, using PRO-PD scores as the primary outcome. Variables were retained based on their individual and cumulative predictive power for slower symptom accumulation over time. This modeling process ultimately yielded a 21-point adherence scale—the PRO-21 diet score—comprising the foods and dietary behaviors most consistently associated with favorable long-term outcomes. The scoring system reflects both the inclusion and exclusion of items associated with faster progression.\nThe final 21-variable PRO-21 diet score was developed based on the components most strongly and consistently associated with slower progression on the PRO-PD scale.

It affects approximately 1% of the general population and up to 5% of individuals over the age of 65 [\nParkinson’s disease (PD), like ET, is a common movement disorder in adults, affecting approximately 1% of individuals aged over 65 years. Although ET and PD are considered distinct diseases, both present with tremor as a prominent clinical feature. While the etiology of ET remains unclear, some individuals with ET may develop additional Parkinsonian features, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. However, the relationship between this clinical overlap and disease progression is not yet fully understood [\nDespite numerous studies investigating the genetic etiology of ET, the hereditary basis remains largely unexplained, owing to factors such as misdiagnosis, genetic heterogeneity, and incomplete penetrance of risk alleles. Familial clustering of ET cases underscores the importance of genetic factors in this disorder. Twin studies have shown concordance rates of 69–93% in monozygotic twins and 27–29% in dizygotic twins, suggesting that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the phenotype. This finding indicates a complex interplay in which genetics plays a significant role but is modulated by nongenetic influences [\nAlthough ET has a strong genetic component, successful genetic analyses have been limited by several confounding factors. These include frequent misdiagnosis, the presence of genetic heterogeneity, incomplete penetrance of risk alleles, and the inability to analyze certain genomic regions, such as introns, long noncoding genes, or short noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs. In addition, environmental influences further complicate the genetic landscape of ET. Consequently, only a small number of pathogenic variants have been reported. This complexity suggests that ET inheritance deviates from simple Mendelian patterns and involves multifactorial genetic and environmental interactions [\nSpecific candidate genes have been identified through studies analyzing families with multiple ET cases, such as\nA large genome-wide association study, including 16,480 ET cases and nearly 1.94 million controls, found 12 variants across 11 loci, with 7 highlighted as putative causal genes (e.g.,\nNumerous studies have investigated the associations of PD risk variants in ET patients.

Epidemiological and neuropathological studies demonstrate a close relationship between ET and PD [\nWith our study, we aim to contribute to this field by elucidating genetic overlaps and distinctions between ET and PD in patients exhibiting both conditions, thus reinforcing the notion that ET is not strictly monosymptomatic and that genetic factors contributing to ET may also influence susceptibility to PD, reflecting the continuum and complexity of movement disorders.\nThe primary aim of this study is to explore the genetic overlap between ET and PD, focusing on the identification of genetic variants that may contribute to both conditions. The hypothesis of this research is that specific genetic mutations are shared between ET and PD, influencing their co-occurrence in some individuals. The clinical features of patients with identified mutations and their associations with these genetic variants are discussed in detail.\nOur study is a retrospective analysis. Between May 2022 and 2024, we screened 350 patients diagnosed with ET who presented to the Movement Disorders Clinic of the Neurology Department at Balikesir University Research Hospital. Of these, 40 who developed PD during follow-up, had first- or second-degree relatives diagnosed with either essential tremor or Parkinson’s disease, and underwent neurodegenerative disease panel testing at the Department of Medical Genetics of Balikesir University were included in the study (\nFor these patients, information was recorded regarding demographic data, family history characteristics, clinical presentations, durations of ET and PD, neurological examinations, medical treatments used, and additional chronic diseases. Genetic analysis based on a neurodegenerative disease panel revealed various mutations in 16 of the 40 patients (\nThis methodology allowed us to investigate the genetic underpinnings of patients with ET who subsequently developed PD, focusing on those with familial predisposition and accessible data from comprehensive genetic screening.\nThe diagnosis of ET in this study was established according to the Consensus Statement of the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) on tremor, which requires the presence of bilateral upper limb action tremors (postural and/or kinetic) of at least three years’ duration, with or without tremors in other locations (such as the head or voice), and the absence of other neurological signs, such as dystonia, ataxia, or Parkinsonism [\nThe diagnosis of PD was made based on the clinical diagnostic criteria of the United Kingdom Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank and the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria, both of which are internationally recognized standards for PD diagnosis.\nET was assessed via the Fahn–Tolosa–Marin Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (FTM), a widely used and validated tool for quantifying tremor severity and its impact on daily living in ET patients [\nInformed consent was obtained from the parents and affected and/or normal family members of all patients, and 5–10 cc of peripheral venous blood was collected from patients into EDTA tubes. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from these blood samples using an ExgeneTM Blood SV isolation kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul, Republic of Korea) and following the manufacturer’s protocol.\nExome sequencing libraries for use with a Human Comprehensive Exome Panel (Twist Bioscience, South San Francisco, CA, USA) were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following the target enrichment process, the libraries were sequenced on a DNBSEQ-G400 (MGI Tech, Shenzhen, China) at 80–100× on-target depth with 150 bp paired ends. The raw reads were cleaned from adapter contamination during the demultiplexing stage; therefore, no further adapter cleaning was performed on the FASTQ files. Alignment to GRCh38 was performed via BWA-MEM 0.7.17 [\nHigh-quality variants were subjected to functional annotation via the Variant Effect Predictor from ENSEMBL [\nFirst, we filtered 300 genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases (\nEthical approval for the study was obtained from the Balikesir University Ethics Committee (Ethics Committee approval number: 2024/21, dated 21 February 2024).\nAmong the 40 patients in our study, 17 different mutations were detected in 16 individuals. Of the mutation-positive patients, 62.5% were male and 37.5% were female, with a mean age of 62.18 ± 16.22 years. The average duration of PD was 3.75 ± 3.19 years, whereas the mean duration of ET was 13.62 ± 12.31 years. The average interval between ET diagnosis and subsequent PD diagnosis was 10.75 ± 10.40 years. Additionally, 31.25% of these patients had consanguineous family histories. Of the patients with ET, 56.25% presented with tremors in both upper extremities, 31.25% presented with tremors in the right upper extremity, and 12.5% presented with tremors in the left upper extremity.\nIn our study, a pathogenic variant,\nIn our study, a pathogenic\nThis patient has had essential tremor for 30 years and was also diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease two years ago. The neurological examination revealed bilateral postural, action, and resting tremors. Additionally, rigidity in the extremities was more pronounced on the right side than the left, accompanied by hypomimia and bradykinesia. The patient was morbidly obese and also diagnosed with hypertrophic heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nThe patient initially started on propranolol (120 mg) and primidone (250 mg) twice daily for ET symptoms. While a moderate therapeutic effect was initially observed, efficacy diminished over time, accompanied by increased tremor severity. Consequently, onabotulinum toxin A therapy was added to the tremor regimen. The patient exhibited a marked response to the first two injections; however, no benefit was observed with the subsequent two applications, leading to discontinuation of this treatment.\nOver the past year, the clinical picture has evolved with the emergence of asymmetric resting tremors and bradykinesia, prompting the initiation of levodopa therapy, which has yielded no significant clinical improvement. The patient did not report any olfactory loss.\nOn assessment, the Fahn–Tolosa–Marin Clinical Rating Scale score for ET increased from 25 at the initial evaluation to 38 following the diagnosis of PD. The MDS-UPDRS nonmotor symptoms score was 10, the motor symptoms score was 60, and the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage score was 1. Glove-and-stocking hypoesthesia and hyporeflexia of deep tendon reflexes were observed on neurological examination, while motor examination revealed no muscle weakness. No pathological reflexes were detected.\nNerve conduction studies revealed sensory polyneuropathy. Brain MRI demonstrated chronic ischemic gliotic lesions consistent with Fazekas grade I, as well as mild diffuse cortical atrophy.\nA 66-year-old male patient, described as Patient No. 3 in\nParkinson’s disease and essential tremor are prevalent age-related conditions whose clinical manifestations worsen over time, eventually impacting on patients’ quality of life [\nGenetic evaluation in ET patients with a strong family history is important for assessing susceptibility to PD and for identifying at-risk individuals. The literature indicates that ET is an independent risk factor for PD, with a significantly higher incidence of PD observed in individuals with ET than in control individuals [\nTherefore, conducting genetic analyses in patients with a family history of ET can be clinically valuable for determining the risk of PD development and for guiding patient monitoring strategies. This approach may enhance understanding regarding the shared genetic basis of ET and PD. Thus, early ET diagnosis may be useful in detecting PD.\nWe identified three pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in three patients (\nSerine/threonine NIMA-related kinases (NEKs), belonging to the kinase family, play key roles in the regulation of the cell cycle.

Among these, we detected six novel variants that have not been previously reported. Seven of the variants were absent from both the gnomAD and ClinVar databases. Additionally, three variants found in three separate cases were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and are considered potentially related to the clinical phenotype.\nThis highlights the genetic heterogeneity and the presence of novel, uncharacterized variants in the cohort. The identification of novel variants not documented in public databases underscores the importance of further functional studies and family segregation analyses to clarify their clinical significance. Moreover, the detection of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in clinically relevant genes supports the contribution of genetic factors to disease manifestation in these patients.\nThe genes listed with VUSs in\nFamily segregation studies and advanced functional assays remain crucial to resolving VUS classification. Until such data are available, VUS should not be used as the sole basis for clinical decision-making but rather as a prompt for further investigation. The identification of VUS in genes relevant to neurodegenerative diseases highlights the ongoing need for comprehensive genetic and functional research to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care.\nIn our cohort of 40 patients, we identified three pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants potentially related to the clinical phenotype in three patients, whereas in the remaining 13 patients, 14 different VUS variants were detected. Since this study is retrospective and family histories were considered, the clinical significance of these variants may change upon re-evaluation. Following progress from clinical and functional studies on these genes, their relevance will become clearer.\nA review of the literature revealed that some VUSs have been implicated in other neurological disorders, such as frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although their association with PD and/or ET has not yet been established, such links may be elucidated in future studies.\nThis underscores the importance of ongoing genetic, clinical, and functional research to better understand the pathogenic potential of VUSs and their possible roles in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD and ET.\nDespite therapeutic advances aimed at symptomatic control, no proven treatment currently exists that alters the course or prevents the occurrence of either Parkinson’s disease or essential tremor. Understanding the genetic basis of disease may provide us with the knowledge and tools to design future therapeutic strategies targeting the very molecular events leading to neuronal loss/dysfunction.\nIn our study, we identified three pathogenic or likely pathogenic genetic variants in patients who developed PD following ET. We aim to share the clinical features and treatment responses of patients carrying these variants and contribute to the growing body of genetic research. Based on the most current databases and available literature, we conclude that the pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants we identified have not been previously reported in association with the development of Parkinson’s disease following essential tremor. These findings are potentially significant, although further investigation and validation in additional cases are necessary to confirm their relevance.\nA limitation of our study is its retrospective design, which prevented the genetic screening of family members. However, family screening is planned for future follow-up.\nMost detected mutations were classified as VUSs. All mutation-positive patients continue to be followed clinically at our center.\nAlthough genetic testing has not yet been integrated into routine clinical practice for essential tremor (ET), elucidating its genetic underpinnings remains a critical area of investigation, with the potential to substantially advance our understanding of its pathophysiology.

Among the most significant genetic links are the genes\nThrough genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of ET, associations with common variants located in intronic regions of\nThe\nWhole-exome sequencing and pedigree analysis of a six-generation Turkish family exhibiting both PD and ET phenotypes was used to identify the mitochondrial serine protease variant\nAlthough ET is currently recognized as a disorder with a strong genetic component, its genetic basis remains largely elusive. Epidemiological and neuropathological studies demonstrate a close relationship between ET and PD [\nWith our study, we aim to contribute to this field by elucidating genetic overlaps and distinctions between ET and PD in patients exhibiting both conditions, thus reinforcing the notion that ET is not strictly monosymptomatic and that genetic factors contributing to ET may also influence susceptibility to PD, reflecting the continuum and complexity of movement disorders.\nThe primary aim of this study is to explore the genetic overlap between ET and PD, focusing on the identification of genetic variants that may contribute to both conditions. The hypothesis of this research is that specific genetic mutations are shared between ET and PD, influencing their co-occurrence in some individuals. The clinical features of patients with identified mutations and their associations with these genetic variants are discussed in detail.\nOur study is a retrospective analysis. Between May 2022 and 2024, we screened 350 patients diagnosed with ET who presented to the Movement Disorders Clinic of the Neurology Department at Balikesir University Research Hospital. Of these, 40 who developed PD during follow-up, had first- or second-degree relatives diagnosed with either essential tremor or Parkinson’s disease, and underwent neurodegenerative disease panel testing at the Department of Medical Genetics of Balikesir University were included in the study (\nFor these patients, information was recorded regarding demographic data, family history characteristics, clinical presentations, durations of ET and PD, neurological examinations, medical treatments used, and additional chronic diseases. Genetic analysis based on a neurodegenerative disease panel revealed various mutations in 16 of the 40 patients (\nThis methodology allowed us to investigate the genetic underpinnings of patients with ET who subsequently developed PD, focusing on those with familial predisposition and accessible data from comprehensive genetic screening.\nThe diagnosis of ET in this study was established according to the Consensus Statement of the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) on tremor, which requires the presence of bilateral upper limb action tremors (postural and/or kinetic) of at least three years’ duration, with or without tremors in other locations (such as the head or voice), and the absence of other neurological signs, such as dystonia, ataxia, or Parkinsonism [\nThe diagnosis of PD was made based on the clinical diagnostic criteria of the United Kingdom Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank and the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria, both of which are internationally recognized standards for PD diagnosis.\nET was assessed via the Fahn–Tolosa–Marin Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (FTM), a widely used and validated tool for quantifying tremor severity and its impact on daily living in ET patients [\nInformed consent was obtained from the parents and affected and/or normal family members of all patients, and 5–10 cc of peripheral venous blood was collected from patients into EDTA tubes. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from these blood samples using an ExgeneTM Blood SV isolation kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul, Republic of Korea) and following the manufacturer’s protocol.\nExome sequencing libraries for use with a Human Comprehensive Exome Panel (Twist Bioscience, South San Francisco, CA, USA) were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following the target enrichment process, the libraries were sequenced on a DNBSEQ-G400 (MGI Tech, Shenzhen, China) at 80–100× on-target depth with 150 bp paired ends. The raw reads were cleaned from adapter contamination during the demultiplexing stage; therefore, no further adapter cleaning was performed on the FASTQ files. Alignment to GRCh38 was performed via BWA-MEM 0.7.17 [\nHigh-quality variants were subjected to functional annotation via the Variant Effect Predictor from ENSEMBL [\nFirst, we filtered 300 genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases (\nEthical approval for the study was obtained from the Balikesir University Ethics Committee (Ethics Committee approval number: 2024/21, dated 21 February 2024).\nAmong the 40 patients in our study, 17 different mutations were detected in 16 individuals. Of the mutation-positive patients, 62.5% were male and 37.5% were female, with a mean age of 62.18 ± 16.22 years. The average duration of PD was 3.75 ± 3.19 years, whereas the mean duration of ET was 13.62 ± 12.31 years. The average interval between ET diagnosis and subsequent PD diagnosis was 10.75 ± 10.40 years. Additionally, 31.25% of these patients had consanguineous family histories. Of the patients with ET, 56.25% presented with tremors in both upper extremities, 31.25% presented with tremors in the right upper extremity, and 12.5% presented with tremors in the left upper extremity.\nIn our study, a pathogenic variant,\nIn our study, a pathogenic\nThis patient has had essential tremor for 30 years and was also diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease two years ago. The neurological examination revealed bilateral postural, action, and resting tremors. Additionally, rigidity in the extremities was more pronounced on the right side than the left, accompanied by hypomimia and bradykinesia. The patient was morbidly obese and also diagnosed with hypertrophic heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nThe patient initially started on propranolol (120 mg) and primidone (250 mg) twice daily for ET symptoms. While a moderate therapeutic effect was initially observed, efficacy diminished over time, accompanied by increased tremor severity. Consequently, onabotulinum toxin A therapy was added to the tremor regimen. The patient exhibited a marked response to the first two injections; however, no benefit was observed with the subsequent two applications, leading to discontinuation of this treatment.\nOver the past year, the clinical picture has evolved with the emergence of asymmetric resting tremors and bradykinesia, prompting the initiation of levodopa therapy, which has yielded no significant clinical improvement. The patient did not report any olfactory loss.\nOn assessment, the Fahn–Tolosa–Marin Clinical Rating Scale score for ET increased from 25 at the initial evaluation to 38 following the diagnosis of PD. The MDS-UPDRS nonmotor symptoms score was 10, the motor symptoms score was 60, and the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage score was 1. Glove-and-stocking hypoesthesia and hyporeflexia of deep tendon reflexes were observed on neurological examination, while motor examination revealed no muscle weakness. No pathological reflexes were detected.\nNerve conduction studies revealed sensory polyneuropathy. Brain MRI demonstrated chronic ischemic gliotic lesions consistent with Fazekas grade I, as well as mild diffuse cortical atrophy.\nA 66-year-old male patient, described as Patient No. 3 in\nParkinson’s disease and essential tremor are prevalent age-related conditions whose clinical manifestations worsen over time, eventually impacting on patients’ quality of life [\nGenetic evaluation in ET patients with a strong family history is important for assessing susceptibility to PD and for identifying at-risk individuals. The literature indicates that ET is an independent risk factor for PD, with a significantly higher incidence of PD observed in individuals with ET than in control individuals [\nTherefore, conducting genetic analyses in patients with a family history of ET can be clinically valuable for determining the risk of PD development and for guiding patient monitoring strategies. This approach may enhance understanding regarding the shared genetic basis of ET and PD. Thus, early ET diagnosis may be useful in detecting PD.\nWe identified three pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in three patients (\nSerine/threonine NIMA-related kinases (NEKs), belonging to the kinase family, play key roles in the regulation of the cell cycle. NEK1 is primarily localized in cytoplasm, although a portion of the protein is also found in mitochondria [\nThe association of this variant with ET and Parkinsonian features in our patient suggests a possible broader neurological impact of\nIn our study, a pathogenic\nThe association between\nIn another study, individuals carrying\nIn our study, a likely pathogenic variant,\nIn this patient, the clinical progression from longstanding ET to asymmetric Parkinsonian features with moderate-to-poor response to dopaminergic therapy aligns with the phenotype described in\nThere are no reports in the literature of PD developing after ET when associated with\nAlthough we identified 14 variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) in 13 patients, as shown in\nThe genes highlighted in bold in\nIn Patient 14, a VUS was detected in the\nIn our study, 17 variants were identified across 17 genes in 16 cases, including 14 missense mutations, one nonsense mutation, and one splice-site variant. Among these, we detected six novel variants that have not been previously reported. Seven of the variants were absent from both the gnomAD and ClinVar databases. Additionally, three variants found in three separate cases were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and are considered potentially related to the clinical phenotype.\nThis highlights the genetic heterogeneity and the presence of novel, uncharacterized variants in the cohort. The identification of novel variants not documented in public databases underscores the importance of further functional studies and family segregation analyses to clarify their clinical significance. Moreover, the detection of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in clinically relevant genes supports the contribution of genetic factors to disease manifestation in these patients.\nThe genes listed with VUSs in\nFamily segregation studies and advanced functional assays remain crucial to resolving VUS classification. Until such data are available, VUS should not be used as the sole basis for clinical decision-making but rather as a prompt for further investigation. The identification of VUS in genes relevant to neurodegenerative diseases highlights the ongoing need for comprehensive genetic and functional research to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care.\nIn our cohort of 40 patients, we identified three pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants potentially related to the clinical phenotype in three patients, whereas in the remaining 13 patients, 14 different VUS variants were detected. Since this study is retrospective and family histories were considered, the clinical significance of these variants may change upon re-evaluation. Following progress from clinical and functional studies on these genes, their relevance will become clearer.\nA review of the literature revealed that some VUSs have been implicated in other neurological disorders, such as frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although their association with PD and/or ET has not yet been established, such links may be elucidated in future studies.\nThis underscores the importance of ongoing genetic, clinical, and functional research to better understand the pathogenic potential of VUSs and their possible roles in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD and ET.\nDespite therapeutic advances aimed at symptomatic control, no proven treatment currently exists that alters the course or prevents the occurrence of either Parkinson’s disease or essential tremor. Understanding the genetic basis of disease may provide us with the knowledge and tools to design future therapeutic strategies targeting the very molecular events leading to neuronal loss/dysfunction.\nIn our study, we identified three pathogenic or likely pathogenic genetic variants in patients who developed PD following ET. We aim to share the clinical features and treatment responses of patients carrying these variants and contribute to the growing body of genetic research. Based on the most current databases and available literature, we conclude that the pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants we identified have not been previously reported in association with the development of Parkinson’s disease following essential tremor. These findings are potentially significant, although further investigation and validation in additional cases are necessary to confirm their relevance.\nA limitation of our study is its retrospective design, which prevented the genetic screening of family members. However, family screening is planned for future follow-up.\nMost detected mutations were classified as VUSs. All mutation-positive patients continue to be followed clinically at our center.\nAlthough genetic testing has not yet been integrated into routine clinical practice for essential tremor (ET), elucidating its genetic underpinnings remains a critical area of investigation, with the potential to substantially advance our understanding of its pathophysiology. Further studies are needed to identify and validate genes responsible for ET.\nComprehensive clinical and genetic evaluations of ET patients who develop PD may provide valuable insights into disease pathophysiology and guide future therapeutic strategies.", "topic": "Parkinson"}

This disease affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The immune system is engaged through the progressive accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn), a driver of immunity and a pathological hallmark of PD. Consequent α-syn-induced immune activation leads to neuronal damage. This leads not only to the activation of microglia within the central nervous system, but also to the recruitment and activation of peripheral immune cells that infiltrate the brain and contribute to a widespread immune response. Moreover, PD-associated genes and risk factors have been increasingly recognized as essential regulators of immune functions. This review summarizes the current understanding of adaptive immunity in PD and explores emerging immunomodulatory strategies that may inform future therapeutic development.", "full_text": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily defined by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates, forming Lewy bodies. While many studies have focused on mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and protein clearance deficits, growing evidence suggests that immune dysregulation significantly contributes to disease onset and progression (\nNeuroinflammation and adaptive immune response in PD. Exposure of modified and aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn) in the brain activates microglia that secrete neurotoxic proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. Modified α-syn and inflammatory mediators drain to peripheral immune tissues to activate antigen presenting cells that lead to induction of α-syn-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that differentiate to specific effector T cells (Teffs), such as Th1, Th17, and Tc, extravasate to foci of brain inflammation, and release proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-17, and TNF-α that exacerbate microglial activation, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. These responses also induce astrocyte activation, resulting in the production of additional inflammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, thereby contributing to neuronal degeneration. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) infiltrating the brain counteract neuroinflammation by suppressing activated astrocytes through the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β. According to the “gut-first” hypothesis, dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota disrupts gut metabolic activity and barrier integrity, leading to increased levels of microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Elevated levels of LPS can translocate into systemic circulation, promoting peripheral immune activation. Microbial dysbiosis and breech of the gut barrier along the gut-brain axis may contribute to α-syn misfolding and aggregation, central inflammation via immune cell trafficking, and spreading and transmission via vagus nerve.\nPD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc and accumulation of misfolded α-syn aggregates, forming Lewy bodies. Its pathogenesis involves interconnected mechanisms, including α-syn aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, impaired protein clearance, genetic mutations, and neuroinflammation. α-Syn, for which its aggregation is one of the hallmarks of PD and related synucleinopathies, is a 140-amino acid protein highly expressed in neurons, especially at synaptic terminals, where it regulates neurotransmitter release and vesicle trafficking [\nIn addition, the clearance of unwanted and damaged proteins plays a critical role in PD pathogenesis [\nVariants in the glucosylceramidase beta 1 (\nAmong these,\nThe gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal (GI) system and CNS, plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of PD [\nWhile T cells are sporadic in the CNS of healthy subjects, mostly in the choroid plexus or CSF, most T cells found in the parenchyma result from the infiltration of activated T cells from the periphery [\nIn PD, CD4+ Teffs play a critical role in the adaptive immune response in the CNS by promoting neurodegeneration through proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as the Fas/FasL pathway [\nCD8+ T cells play a significant role in CNS through their involvement in adaptive immunity and impact on neurological conditions. The primary responsibility of CD8+ T cells in the periphery and CNS is to kill infected cells by recognizing antigens presented by MHC I molecules. Upon encountering antigens presented by MHC I, CD8+ T cells differentiate into cytotoxic effector T cells (Tc), which are capable of releasing cytokines, such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, and cytotoxic molecules, such as granzymes and perforins, to induce apoptosis of target cells [\nIn PD, CD8+ Teffs are found in both peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, indicating their activation and possible involvement in the progression of these disorders [\nTregs play a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing chronic inflammation [\nThe primary role of Tregs is to maintain immunological tolerance, particularly in the context of controlling ongoing immune responses to prevent pathological outcomes.

These immune responses change over time during disease progression. α-Syn, a central feature of PD pathology, not only forms toxic aggregates but also plays an active role in triggering and sustaining immune activation. It stimulates both innate and adaptive immune responses, promotes neuroinflammation, and contributes to neuronal damage. Because α-synuclein is recognized as an antigen by both microglia and peripheral monocytes, innate immune responses can be initiated in both the brain and the periphery. In addition to chronic inflammation mediated by microglia in the brain, changes in immune cell populations have also been observed in the peripheral blood of patients with PD, involving both innate and adaptive immune cells. Peripheral immune cells, such as T and B lymphocytes, have been shown to infiltrate the brain, further contributing to inflammation in the CNS. It is possible that an initial innate immune response to modified α-syn triggers a more sustained adaptive immune reaction that spreads damage to other parts of the brain. T cells require antigen presentation via MHC molecules, whereas B cells recognize antigens through their surface receptors. Once activated, adaptive immune cells may further promote inflammation and neurodegeneration.

While many studies have focused on mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and protein clearance deficits, growing evidence suggests that immune dysregulation significantly contributes to disease onset and progression (\nNeuroinflammation and adaptive immune response in PD. Exposure of modified and aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn) in the brain activates microglia that secrete neurotoxic proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. Modified α-syn and inflammatory mediators drain to peripheral immune tissues to activate antigen presenting cells that lead to induction of α-syn-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that differentiate to specific effector T cells (Teffs), such as Th1, Th17, and Tc, extravasate to foci of brain inflammation, and release proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-17, and TNF-α that exacerbate microglial activation, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. These responses also induce astrocyte activation, resulting in the production of additional inflammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, thereby contributing to neuronal degeneration. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) infiltrating the brain counteract neuroinflammation by suppressing activated astrocytes through the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β. According to the “gut-first” hypothesis, dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota disrupts gut metabolic activity and barrier integrity, leading to increased levels of microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Elevated levels of LPS can translocate into systemic circulation, promoting peripheral immune activation. Microbial dysbiosis and breech of the gut barrier along the gut-brain axis may contribute to α-syn misfolding and aggregation, central inflammation via immune cell trafficking, and spreading and transmission via vagus nerve.\nPD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc and accumulation of misfolded α-syn aggregates, forming Lewy bodies. Its pathogenesis involves interconnected mechanisms, including α-syn aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, impaired protein clearance, genetic mutations, and neuroinflammation. α-Syn, for which its aggregation is one of the hallmarks of PD and related synucleinopathies, is a 140-amino acid protein highly expressed in neurons, especially at synaptic terminals, where it regulates neurotransmitter release and vesicle trafficking [\nIn addition, the clearance of unwanted and damaged proteins plays a critical role in PD pathogenesis [\nVariants in the glucosylceramidase beta 1 (\nAmong these,\nThe gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal (GI) system and CNS, plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of PD [\nWhile T cells are sporadic in the CNS of healthy subjects, mostly in the choroid plexus or CSF, most T cells found in the parenchyma result from the infiltration of activated T cells from the periphery [\nIn PD, CD4+ Teffs play a critical role in the adaptive immune response in the CNS by promoting neurodegeneration through proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as the Fas/FasL pathway [\nCD8+ T cells play a significant role in CNS through their involvement in adaptive immunity and impact on neurological conditions. The primary responsibility of CD8+ T cells in the periphery and CNS is to kill infected cells by recognizing antigens presented by MHC I molecules.

Recent advances in quantitative postprocessing techniques have expanded the utility of sMRI beyond visual assessments by enabling the detection of subtle morphological changes associated with various neurological and psychiatric conditions. This review summarizes current clinical applications of sMRI-based analysis, including brain volumetry, shape analysis, voxel-based morphometry (VBM), surface-based morphometry, source-based morphometry, and voxel-based lesion–symptom mapping (VLSM). Volumetric and shape-based analyses allow for assessments of region-specific atrophy and subregional morphological alterations, while VBM and surface-based morphometry provide complementary insights into tissue volumes and the architecture of the cortical surface. Source-based morphometry reveals network-level patterns of structural covariance, and VLSM directly correlates lesion locations with functional outcomes, particularly in stroke. It has been demonstrated that these methodologies are clinically relevant in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and major depressive disorder. By quantifying structural brain alterations that are not readily detectable using conventional imaging methods, these tools improve diagnostic accuracy, support prognostication, and facilitate monitoring of treatment effects. This review highlights the growing integration of sMRI postprocessing techniques into clinical neurology.", "full_text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a ubiquitous technique for the high-resolution spatial visualization of brain structures. T1-weighted (T1), T2-weighted (T2), and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequences are the most commonly used for assessing brain anatomy and pathology. These sequences highlight qualitatively different aspects of tissue properties, providing complementary views of brain morphology and pathology.\nT1 sequences are typically used for high-resolution structural imaging to provide clear delineation of anatomical structures. These sequences are sensitive to the longitudinal relaxation time of tissues, meaning that areas with a high water content (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) appear dark, with structures such as gray matter and white matter appearing brighter. T1 imaging is excellent for observing normal brain anatomy and detecting structural abnormalities such as tumors, Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), infarcts, and atrophy.\nCollectively, these three types of MRI sequence yield complementary information to provide a comprehensive understanding of brain structure and pathology. They facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of a broad spectrum of neurological conditions. Additionally, these sequences serve as valuable sources for quantitative MRI-based analyses.\nIn this review we introduce various structural MRI (sMRI) postprocessing techniques that are applied in clinical practice, including brain volumetry, shape analysis, voxel-based morphometry (VBM), surface-based morphometry, source-based morphometry, and voxel-based lesion–symptom mapping (VLSM). Additionally, we present an overview of research into diverse neurological and psychiatric disorders where these methods of imaging analysis have been used. This review delineates the evolving role of sMRI in neurology, underscoring its critical contributions to both clinical practice and neuroscience research.\nBrain volumetry involves quantifying the volume of various brain regions, providing critical insights into structural brain changes associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders. High-resolution MRI provides detailed anatomical data, making it an invaluable tool for volumetric analysis. Volume measurements have become essential for understanding disease mechanisms, monitoring progression, and evaluating treatment responses in conditions such as AD, MS, and schizophrenia. As this field advances, the choice between manual and automated volumetric methods remains a subject of debate, with each approach offering distinct advantages and limitations.\nManual brain volumetry requires a trained rater to meticulously delineate regions of interest (ROIs) by hand on MRI scans. An expert typically manually outlines the boundaries of specific brain structures—such as the hippocampus, amygdala, or subcortical nuclei—on individual slices or via three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction.\nOn the other hand, automated brain volumetry uses software algorithms to segment and quantify brain structure volumes without manual intervention. These methods typically rely on image registration, statistical modeling, and machine-learning techniques to identify anatomical regions and calculate their volumes.\nChoosing between manual and automated volumetry methods ultimately depends on the specific research or clinical needs. Manual segmentation remains the preferred method for studies requiring the highest precision, particularly when brain regions are poorly defined or when significant anatomical distortion is present. In such cases, manual methods allow for nuanced, case-by-case delineation to ensure every structure is accurately measured despite the presence of irregularities. Conversely, automated volumetric methods are well-suited to large-scale studies, longitudinal research, and clinical environments where speed, reproducibility, and consistency are critical. Automated techniques can handle volumes of data that would be infeasible to process manually. Furthermore, the accuracy of automated tools is increasing as computational models continue to improve, making them more reliable even in cases with subtle abnormalities.\nMRI-based volumetric analysis, particularly of small brain structures such as the hippocampus, is highly sensitive to methodological variability including the pixel-inclusion criteria applied during boundary delineation and the technical specifications of the analysis platform.\nBrain volumetry based on MRI data is a cornerstone technique for studying changes in brain structure between healthy and disease states. While manual volumetry remains highly accurate, it is slow and susceptible to observer variability. Automated volumetry provides faster and more-reproducible results, but it may struggle with complex brain morphologies and therefore require careful validation. Automated methods are expected to become increasingly sophisticated as neuroimaging technologies continue to evolve, leading to the more-widespread and reliable use of volumetric analysis in both research and clinical practice.\nVolumetric MRI assists early diagnosis and monitoring in neurodegenerative disorders. Hippocampal volumetry aids early AD detection by identifying characteristic atrophy patterns, and it can be used to track disease progression and evaluate treatment responses. In MS, global and regional brain atrophy serves as a marker of disease progression alongside lesion assessments. Additionally, subtle regional volume loss in early Parkinson's disease (PD) may predict cognitive decline, and volumetry can be used to objectively evaluate treatment effects in clinical trials of dementia.\nVariability in the scanners and software used for brain volumetry results in volume estimates that are inconsistent across sites or over time. Automated segmentation errors may occur, particularly in cases with severe atrophy or anatomical distortion, while precise manual volumetry remains impractical for routine use. Volumetric methods may miss localized subregional changes and require careful normalization for intracranial volume differences. Standardization and rigorous quality control are critical to addressing these limitations.\nThe total intracranial cavity volume (TICV) is used as a surrogate for an individual's premorbid brain size, which is particularly relevant when analyzing conditions involving cerebral atrophy.\nWhile T2 MRI can clearly delineate the dura mater (which closely approximates the inner boundary of the skull), high-resolution 3D T2 sequences are not commonly acquired in clinical protocols. Eritaia et al.\nVarious automated techniques have been developed in efforts to overcome the challenges of manual TICV measurements. However, there are often notable discrepancies in TICV values between those obtained manually and those obtained automatically.\nMethods for automated TICV estimation that are more accurate and reliable have recently been introduced.\nShape analysis represents a significant advancement in neuroimaging, offering detailed statistical assessments of morphometric alterations in specific brain subregions. Unlike traditional volumetry, which provides overall volume measurements for a given brain structure, shape analysis employs 3D modeling to examine the precise boundaries and contours of individual structures. This makes it possible to detect localized atrophy or hypertrophy within a region, revealing subtle shape changes that are indicative of pathological processes even when the total volume is relatively preserved. As illustrated in\nImplementing shape analysis generally involves several steps. The brain is first segmented into distinct ROIs, and then specialized algorithms extract the 3D shape of each region, capturing its complex curvature and geometric properties. These shapes can then be compared across subjects or time points to reveal differences in morphology that may reflect underlying neurobiological processes.\nA key advantage of shape analysis is its high sensitivity to localized deformations within brain subregions, which is crucial for analyzing diseases that target specific brain areas. For example, in AD—which has a hallmark of hippocampal atrophy—shape analysis can pinpoint the precise subfields of the hippocampus that are most affected by neurodegeneration.\nWhile volumetric MRI techniques have greatly improved our understanding of brain structure, shape analysis offers distinct benefits. Volume measurements might sometimes not detect small but important localized changes. Also, a brain region might undergo atrophy without a substantial change in its overall volume, despite its shape being significantly altered. Shape analysis can detect these shape changes, which often serve as early indicators of pathological processes. This limitation of volumetric analysis is due to it typically examining large, predefined ROIs, potentially missing smaller but clinically significant alterations.\nShape analysis enables quantification of surface-based metrics and other detailed structural parameters that volumetric methods cannot capture. It has demonstrated high sensitivity in identifying morphological changes across various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, developmental abnormalities, and traumatic brain injuries. This increased sensitivity is potentially significant for improving diagnostic accuracy, monitoring disease progression, and developing targeted therapeutic interventions.\nThe high sensitivity of shape analysis in detecting localized structural changes aids early diagnoses and prognoses. In AD, shape analysis can identify subfield-specific hippocampal atrophy that distinguishes AD from normal aging and predicts progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It can also reveal subtle hippocampal deformations in depression, potential biomarkers in epilepsy when MRI produces normal findings, and patterns of subcortical atrophy in PD and ALS, supporting disease staging and subtype characterization.\nShape analysis depends on a precise initial segmentation process, with inaccuracies therein leading to misleading results. The lack of standardization across algorithms complicates comparisons between studies. Additionally, interpreting shape changes when there is no overall volume change is challenging for clinicians. Shape analysis is typically applied at the group level, since its use for individualized diagnoses remains restricted by normal anatomical variability between subjects. Finally, the computational complexity of shape analysis and its specialized software requirements hinder its widespread clinical implementation, emphasizing the need for user-friendly pipelines and standardized protocols.\nVBM is a widely used neuroimaging technique for analyzing sMRI data to compare local proportions or volumes of gray matter, white matter, or CSF across the brain. Although the VBM framework was formally proposed by Ashburner and Friston\nThe VBM process involves several key steps:\n\n1) Spatial normalization in which high-resolution T1 images are aligned to a standard brain template, placing all scans into the same stereotaxic space.\n2) Segmenting normalized images into gray matter and white matter (and sometimes CSF) using algorithms that classify tissue types.\n3) Smoothing the segmented images with a Gaussian kernel to reduce noise and account for anatomical variability between individuals, facilitating voxel-wise statistical analysis.\n4) Voxel-wise statistical analyses to compare gray-matter concentrations between groups or to correlate with covariates, with corrections for multiple comparisons typically applied using Gaussian random field theory.\nIn addition, techniques such as threshold-free cluster enhancement can be applied to improve cluster detection without relying on a hard voxel-wise threshold,\nVBM has been extensively applied in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. For example, it has been used to investigate structural brain changes in epilepsy,\nA notable limitation of VBM is the introduction of substantial variability by using different image-processing pipelines, which interferes with reproducibility. For example, one study found considerable differences in gray-matter findings when the same dataset was processed using four common VBM pipelines including CAT,\nA commentary article has provided practical guidelines for conducting and presenting VBM studies to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and utility.\n\n1) Clearly state the study's rationale and describe the data.\n2) Explain how brain segmentations are produced.\n3) Describe the method used for intersubject spatial normalization.\n4) Make the statistical analyses transparent.\n5) Clearly state the method used to correct for multiple testing.\n6) Present results unambiguously.\n7) Justify any nonstandard analyses.\n8) Guard against common pitfalls.\n9) Report any exclusions, and justify them.\n10) Interpret results cautiously while considering potential biases and limitations.\nVBM is a powerful tool for assessing brain structure that has been widely adopted in both research and clinical settings. Nevertheless, its limitations—particularly the variability associated with different analysis pipelines—should be addressed through systematic validation and methodological improvements. Combining VBM with other morphometric techniques may further improve our understanding of brain structure and its relationship to neurological and psychiatric conditions.\nSource-based morphometry is a multivariate statistical approach used in sMRI to identify patterns of covariance among brain regions. It builds upon the principles of VBM but uses independent-components analysis to decompose the data, yielding a network-level view of structural variations between individuals.\nWhile both source-based morphometry and VBM analyze brain morphology, the former's multivariate approach offers certain advantages. VBM examines each voxel independently, potentially missing interrelationships between distant brain regions. In contrast, source-based morphometry captures covariance among voxels across the entire brain, thereby providing insight into network-level structural patterns—insights that are especially relevant for complex neurological and psychiatric conditions.\nRecent methodological advances have further improved the utility of source-based morphometry. For example, constrained source-based morphometry incorporates prior anatomical information to guide the component-extraction process, combining the strengths of ROI and data-driven approaches.\nOverall, source-based morphometry represents a pivotal development in neuroimaging by offering a network-level understanding of structural brain alterations. This perspective is fundamental for advancing our understanding of complex brain disorders and could ultimately contribute to improved diagnoses and treatments.\nSource-based morphometry offers insights into network-level brain changes relevant to diseases with widespread pathology. In AD, it identifies coatrophy patterns across frontal, parietal, and temporal regions that are linked to cognitive decline. In schizophrenia, source-based morphometry reveals gray-matter networks associated with symptoms and connectivity disruptions. PD and MS studies have revealed structural covariance involving the basal ganglia and cortex that align with clinical subtypes. While not yet applied routinely in clinical practice, source-based morphometry holds promise in identifying system-level biomarkers to aid diagnoses and patient stratification.\nSource-based morphometry remains largely restricted to research settings due to several challenges. Interpreting the independent components is difficult since they often span anatomically diverse regions and require specific expertise to correlate them with clinical data. Results can vary depending on parameters such as the number of extracted components, affecting reproducibility. Reliable analyses typically demand large samples, restricting the use of source-based morphometry in smaller studies. Moreover, source-based morphometry tools are not widely integrated into clinical workflows, and clinicians might not be familiar with interpreting network-level patterns. Standardization, improved usability, and validation against clinical outcomes are essential for advancing the clinical relevance of source-based morphometry.\nSurface-based morphometry is a powerful neuroimaging technique for analyzing the structural characteristics of the cerebral cortex. It quantifies various cortical parameters such as the cortical thickness, sulcal depth, sulcal width, fractal dimension (FD), and gyrification index, each of which is important for understanding disease-related changes in cortical morphology.\nThe cortical thickness is the distance between the white-matter surface and the pial surface of the cortex, which is a critical parameter in many neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions (\nThe sulcal depth is the distance from the cortical surface to the deepest point of a sulcus, whereas the sulcal width is the distance between the opposite sides of a sulcus. Disease-related changes in these measures have been observed. Patients with BECTS have an increased sulcal depth in the left fusiform gyrus, indicating possible neurodevelopmental disturbances.\nThe FD of the cortex is a measure of its geometric complexity (\nThe gyrification index quantifies the degree of cortical folding, and changes in gyrification have also been reported in disease states. BECTS patients exhibit increased gyrification in certain regions, which is negatively correlated with verbal IQ.\nSurface-based morphometry provides invaluable insights into cortical morphology, but it is important to consider potential limitations and sources of bias of this approach. Factors such as sample size, image acquisition protocols, and statistical methods can influence the obtained results, and must be accounted for when interpreting the findings. Moreover, combining VBM with surface-based morphometry has been proposed for obtaining complementary information on gray-matter volume and cortical structures,\nThe cortical thickness is a key surface-based morphometry metric that could be a useful biomarker in neurodegenerative and movement disorders. In PD, thinning in frontal and parietal regions correlates with the disease stage and cognitive status, aiding prognoses and subtype differentiation. Regional thinning—especially in the entorhinal cortex—supports early diagnoses of AD and MCI. Surface-based morphometry has also shown promise in conditions such as fibromyalgia, where cortical thinning in pain-related regions reflects the symptom severity. These findings highlight the potential of surface-based morphometry to provide spatially detailed, disease-relevant insights in clinical practice.\nSurface-based morphometry faces challenges similar to volumetry, with additional issues that are specific to cortical measures. Estimates of the cortical thickness can vary between software platforms and will be affected by the scan quality and motion artifacts, requiring strict quality control. Interpreting cross-sectional data is difficult due to natural anatomical variability, and performing diagnoses in individual patients is restricted by the absence of normative databases. Cortical thinning is only an indirect marker of pathology and can be influenced by nonneuronal factors. Longitudinal studies are also vulnerable to scanner variability and measurement noise. Standardized protocols and robust reference datasets are needed to improve the clinical utility of surface-based morphometry.\nVLSM is an advanced approach for correlating focal brain lesions with clinical deficits.\nPerforming VLSM typically involves several steps. First, each patient's lesion is delineated (either manually or with automated tools) to create a binary lesion map.\nResearchers have also begun integrating VLSM with other imaging modalities to improve our understanding of brain function and recovery. For example, combining VLSM with functional MRI\nVLSM has proven to be a powerful tool for investigating brain–behavior relationships in patients with focal brain damage. Ongoing advancements in computational techniques will lead to refinements in VLSM that are expected to further improve its sensitivity and specificity in identifying the brain regions that are critical for specific cognitive and motor functions. Future developments may include improved spatial normalization methods, more-robust statistical approaches (e.g., better handling of multiple comparisons), and deeper integration of VLSM with other neuroimaging modalities—all aimed at providing a more-comprehensive understanding of how brain lesions lead to clinical symptoms.\nVLSM helps to identify the brain regions that are critical for specific functions, aiding prognoses and rehabilitation planning, especially after stroke. For example, lesions in left perisylvian areas are linked to persistent aphasia, which can guide speech therapy. Similarly, damage to the internal capsule or motor cortex predicts the potential for motor recovery. Beyond stroke, VLSM has revealed lesion patterns associated with poststroke pain syndromes such as complex regional pain syndrome, particularly when this involves the corticospinal tract. By mapping lesion–deficit relationships in a voxel-wise manner, VLSM supports individualized rehabilitation strategies and outcome predictions.\nVLSM faces key challenges, especially regarding spatial normalization in brains with large or irregular lesions, which can reduce the mapping accuracy in the presence of lesion-related anatomical distortion. The results are sensitive to the registration algorithms utilized, and require large and diverse samples to ensure adequate voxel coverage. The need to correct for multiple comparisons may reduce the sensitivity, and controlling for lesion size is essential to avoid confounding effects. The clinical application of VLSM to specific cases is restricted by its reliance on group-level data. Improvements in normalization methods and integration with connectome data may improve its precision and clinical relevance.\nSeveral emerging trends have recently begun to shape the future of sMRI-based analysis in clinical practice. These include applying deep learning to image analysis, combining sMRI with other modalities (e.g., multimodal imaging and biomarkers), and developing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to interpret the output from automated analyses.\nRecent advances in deep learning, particularly in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have significantly improved sMRI-based analyses. CNNs can accurately identify complex brain patterns, improving tasks such as predicting the brain age, disease classification, and lesion segmentation. Notably, CNN-based models demonstrated superior accuracy in distinguishing AD from healthy controls using sMRI alone, even predicting amyloid pathology, which could support early noninvasive screening.\nIntegrating sMRI with additional biomarkers and imaging modalities improves its diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases. For example, combining the MRI-derived hippocampal volume with positron-emission tomography (PET) amyloid or tau biomarkers substantially improves AD diagnoses and predictions of cognitive decline.\nAs complex artificial intelligence (AI) models become more common in sMRI-based analyses, ensuring interpretability has emerged as a critical priority, leading to the development of XAI.\nsMRI postprocessing techniques—including brain volumetry, shape analysis, VBM, surface-based morphometry, source-based morphometry, and VLSM—have become indispensable tools in clinical neurology (", "content_for_embedding": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a ubiquitous technique for the high-resolution spatial visualization of brain structures.

This makes it possible to detect localized atrophy or hypertrophy within a region, revealing subtle shape changes that are indicative of pathological processes even when the total volume is relatively preserved. As illustrated in\nImplementing shape analysis generally involves several steps. The brain is first segmented into distinct ROIs, and then specialized algorithms extract the 3D shape of each region, capturing its complex curvature and geometric properties. These shapes can then be compared across subjects or time points to reveal differences in morphology that may reflect underlying neurobiological processes.\nA key advantage of shape analysis is its high sensitivity to localized deformations within brain subregions, which is crucial for analyzing diseases that target specific brain areas. For example, in AD—which has a hallmark of hippocampal atrophy—shape analysis can pinpoint the precise subfields of the hippocampus that are most affected by neurodegeneration.\nWhile volumetric MRI techniques have greatly improved our understanding of brain structure, shape analysis offers distinct benefits. Volume measurements might sometimes not detect small but important localized changes. Also, a brain region might undergo atrophy without a substantial change in its overall volume, despite its shape being significantly altered. Shape analysis can detect these shape changes, which often serve as early indicators of pathological processes. This limitation of volumetric analysis is due to it typically examining large, predefined ROIs, potentially missing smaller but clinically significant alterations.\nShape analysis enables quantification of surface-based metrics and other detailed structural parameters that volumetric methods cannot capture. It has demonstrated high sensitivity in identifying morphological changes across various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, developmental abnormalities, and traumatic brain injuries. This increased sensitivity is potentially significant for improving diagnostic accuracy, monitoring disease progression, and developing targeted therapeutic interventions.\nThe high sensitivity of shape analysis in detecting localized structural changes aids early diagnoses and prognoses. In AD, shape analysis can identify subfield-specific hippocampal atrophy that distinguishes AD from normal aging and predicts progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It can also reveal subtle hippocampal deformations in depression, potential biomarkers in epilepsy when MRI produces normal findings, and patterns of subcortical atrophy in PD and ALS, supporting disease staging and subtype characterization.\nShape analysis depends on a precise initial segmentation process, with inaccuracies therein leading to misleading results. The lack of standardization across algorithms complicates comparisons between studies. Additionally, interpreting shape changes when there is no overall volume change is challenging for clinicians. Shape analysis is typically applied at the group level, since its use for individualized diagnoses remains restricted by normal anatomical variability between subjects. Finally, the computational complexity of shape analysis and its specialized software requirements hinder its widespread clinical implementation, emphasizing the need for user-friendly pipelines and standardized protocols.\nVBM is a widely used neuroimaging technique for analyzing sMRI data to compare local proportions or volumes of gray matter, white matter, or CSF across the brain. Although the VBM framework was formally proposed by Ashburner and Friston\nThe VBM process involves several key steps:\n\n1) Spatial normalization in which high-resolution T1 images are aligned to a standard brain template, placing all scans into the same stereotaxic space.\n2) Segmenting normalized images into gray matter and white matter (and sometimes CSF) using algorithms that classify tissue types.\n3) Smoothing the segmented images with a Gaussian kernel to reduce noise and account for anatomical variability between individuals, facilitating voxel-wise statistical analysis.\n4) Voxel-wise statistical analyses to compare gray-matter concentrations between groups or to correlate with covariates, with corrections for multiple comparisons typically applied using Gaussian random field theory.\nIn addition, techniques such as threshold-free cluster enhancement can be applied to improve cluster detection without relying on a hard voxel-wise threshold,\nVBM has been extensively applied in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. For example, it has been used to investigate structural brain changes in epilepsy,\nA notable limitation of VBM is the introduction of substantial variability by using different image-processing pipelines, which interferes with reproducibility. For example, one study found considerable differences in gray-matter findings when the same dataset was processed using four common VBM pipelines including CAT,\nA commentary article has provided practical guidelines for conducting and presenting VBM studies to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and utility.\n\n1) Clearly state the study's rationale and describe the data.\n2) Explain how brain segmentations are produced.\n3) Describe the method used for intersubject spatial normalization.\n4) Make the statistical analyses transparent.\n5) Clearly state the method used to correct for multiple testing.\n6) Present results unambiguously.\n7) Justify any nonstandard analyses.\n8) Guard against common pitfalls.\n9) Report any exclusions, and justify them.\n10) Interpret results cautiously while considering potential biases and limitations.\nVBM is a powerful tool for assessing brain structure that has been widely adopted in both research and clinical settings. Nevertheless, its limitations—particularly the variability associated with different analysis pipelines—should be addressed through systematic validation and methodological improvements. Combining VBM with other morphometric techniques may further improve our understanding of brain structure and its relationship to neurological and psychiatric conditions.\nSource-based morphometry is a multivariate statistical approach used in sMRI to identify patterns of covariance among brain regions. It builds upon the principles of VBM but uses independent-components analysis to decompose the data, yielding a network-level view of structural variations between individuals.\nWhile both source-based morphometry and VBM analyze brain morphology, the former's multivariate approach offers certain advantages. VBM examines each voxel independently, potentially missing interrelationships between distant brain regions. In contrast, source-based morphometry captures covariance among voxels across the entire brain, thereby providing insight into network-level structural patterns—insights that are especially relevant for complex neurological and psychiatric conditions.\nRecent methodological advances have further improved the utility of source-based morphometry. For example, constrained source-based morphometry incorporates prior anatomical information to guide the component-extraction process, combining the strengths of ROI and data-driven approaches.\nOverall, source-based morphometry represents a pivotal development in neuroimaging by offering a network-level understanding of structural brain alterations. This perspective is fundamental for advancing our understanding of complex brain disorders and could ultimately contribute to improved diagnoses and treatments.\nSource-based morphometry offers insights into network-level brain changes relevant to diseases with widespread pathology. In AD, it identifies coatrophy patterns across frontal, parietal, and temporal regions that are linked to cognitive decline. In schizophrenia, source-based morphometry reveals gray-matter networks associated with symptoms and connectivity disruptions. PD and MS studies have revealed structural covariance involving the basal ganglia and cortex that align with clinical subtypes. While not yet applied routinely in clinical practice, source-based morphometry holds promise in identifying system-level biomarkers to aid diagnoses and patient stratification.\nSource-based morphometry remains largely restricted to research settings due to several challenges. Interpreting the independent components is difficult since they often span anatomically diverse regions and require specific expertise to correlate them with clinical data. Results can vary depending on parameters such as the number of extracted components, affecting reproducibility. Reliable analyses typically demand large samples, restricting the use of source-based morphometry in smaller studies. Moreover, source-based morphometry tools are not widely integrated into clinical workflows, and clinicians might not be familiar with interpreting network-level patterns. Standardization, improved usability, and validation against clinical outcomes are essential for advancing the clinical relevance of source-based morphometry.\nSurface-based morphometry is a powerful neuroimaging technique for analyzing the structural characteristics of the cerebral cortex. It quantifies various cortical parameters such as the cortical thickness, sulcal depth, sulcal width, fractal dimension (FD), and gyrification index, each of which is important for understanding disease-related changes in cortical morphology.\nThe cortical thickness is the distance between the white-matter surface and the pial surface of the cortex, which is a critical parameter in many neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions (\nThe sulcal depth is the distance from the cortical surface to the deepest point of a sulcus, whereas the sulcal width is the distance between the opposite sides of a sulcus. Disease-related changes in these measures have been observed. Patients with BECTS have an increased sulcal depth in the left fusiform gyrus, indicating possible neurodevelopmental disturbances.\nThe FD of the cortex is a measure of its geometric complexity (\nThe gyrification index quantifies the degree of cortical folding, and changes in gyrification have also been reported in disease states. BECTS patients exhibit increased gyrification in certain regions, which is negatively correlated with verbal IQ.\nSurface-based morphometry provides invaluable insights into cortical morphology, but it is important to consider potential limitations and sources of bias of this approach. Factors such as sample size, image acquisition protocols, and statistical methods can influence the obtained results, and must be accounted for when interpreting the findings. Moreover, combining VBM with surface-based morphometry has been proposed for obtaining complementary information on gray-matter volume and cortical structures,\nThe cortical thickness is a key surface-based morphometry metric that could be a useful biomarker in neurodegenerative and movement disorders. In PD, thinning in frontal and parietal regions correlates with the disease stage and cognitive status, aiding prognoses and subtype differentiation. Regional thinning—especially in the entorhinal cortex—supports early diagnoses of AD and MCI. Surface-based morphometry has also shown promise in conditions such as fibromyalgia, where cortical thinning in pain-related regions reflects the symptom severity. These findings highlight the potential of surface-based morphometry to provide spatially detailed, disease-relevant insights in clinical practice.\nSurface-based morphometry faces challenges similar to volumetry, with additional issues that are specific to cortical measures. Estimates of the cortical thickness can vary between software platforms and will be affected by the scan quality and motion artifacts, requiring strict quality control. Interpreting cross-sectional data is difficult due to natural anatomical variability, and performing diagnoses in individual patients is restricted by the absence of normative databases. Cortical thinning is only an indirect marker of pathology and can be influenced by nonneuronal factors. Longitudinal studies are also vulnerable to scanner variability and measurement noise. Standardized protocols and robust reference datasets are needed to improve the clinical utility of surface-based morphometry.\nVLSM is an advanced approach for correlating focal brain lesions with clinical deficits.\nPerforming VLSM typically involves several steps. First, each patient's lesion is delineated (either manually or with automated tools) to create a binary lesion map.\nResearchers have also begun integrating VLSM with other imaging modalities to improve our understanding of brain function and recovery. For example, combining VLSM with functional MRI\nVLSM has proven to be a powerful tool for investigating brain–behavior relationships in patients with focal brain damage. Ongoing advancements in computational techniques will lead to refinements in VLSM that are expected to further improve its sensitivity and specificity in identifying the brain regions that are critical for specific cognitive and motor functions. Future developments may include improved spatial normalization methods, more-robust statistical approaches (e.g., better handling of multiple comparisons), and deeper integration of VLSM with other neuroimaging modalities—all aimed at providing a more-comprehensive understanding of how brain lesions lead to clinical symptoms.\nVLSM helps to identify the brain regions that are critical for specific functions, aiding prognoses and rehabilitation planning, especially after stroke. For example, lesions in left perisylvian areas are linked to persistent aphasia, which can guide speech therapy. Similarly, damage to the internal capsule or motor cortex predicts the potential for motor recovery. Beyond stroke, VLSM has revealed lesion patterns associated with poststroke pain syndromes such as complex regional pain syndrome, particularly when this involves the corticospinal tract. By mapping lesion–deficit relationships in a voxel-wise manner, VLSM supports individualized rehabilitation strategies and outcome predictions.\nVLSM faces key challenges, especially regarding spatial normalization in brains with large or irregular lesions, which can reduce the mapping accuracy in the presence of lesion-related anatomical distortion. The results are sensitive to the registration algorithms utilized, and require large and diverse samples to ensure adequate voxel coverage. The need to correct for multiple comparisons may reduce the sensitivity, and controlling for lesion size is essential to avoid confounding effects. The clinical application of VLSM to specific cases is restricted by its reliance on group-level data. Improvements in normalization methods and integration with connectome data may improve its precision and clinical relevance.\nSeveral emerging trends have recently begun to shape the future of sMRI-based analysis in clinical practice. These include applying deep learning to image analysis, combining sMRI with other modalities (e.g., multimodal imaging and biomarkers), and developing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to interpret the output from automated analyses.\nRecent advances in deep learning, particularly in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have significantly improved sMRI-based analyses. CNNs can accurately identify complex brain patterns, improving tasks such as predicting the brain age, disease classification, and lesion segmentation. Notably, CNN-based models demonstrated superior accuracy in distinguishing AD from healthy controls using sMRI alone, even predicting amyloid pathology, which could support early noninvasive screening.\nIntegrating sMRI with additional biomarkers and imaging modalities improves its diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases. For example, combining the MRI-derived hippocampal volume with positron-emission tomography (PET) amyloid or tau biomarkers substantially improves AD diagnoses and predictions of cognitive decline.\nAs complex artificial intelligence (AI) models become more common in sMRI-based analyses, ensuring interpretability has emerged as a critical priority, leading to the development of XAI.\nsMRI postprocessing techniques—including brain volumetry, shape analysis, VBM, surface-based morphometry, source-based morphometry, and VLSM—have become indispensable tools in clinical neurology (", "topic": "Parkinson"}

For example, we excluded studies related to vascular parkinsonism, Lewy body dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Records that included PD with a secondary diagnosis, such as dementia, were not excluded during this step. In the case that multiple populations were included within one intervention, records were excluded if the individual populations were analyzed as a combined sample, such as Khattab et al.

This secondary retrieval of records was conducted on 27 March 2025, using the following search terms: [“parkinson” AND (“responder” OR “response” OR “responsiveness” OR “responsive” NOT “correspond” NOT “corresponding”)) NOT (Parkinson [Author])]. Identical screening procedures were completed as in the primary retrieval (\nInitial data extraction included: first author, year of publication, responder outcome variable(s), cutoff value determining responder status, intervention, sample size of intervention group, responder ratio of intervention group, and characteristics of the responder/nonresponder groups that were evaluated statistically.

For example, in Stocchi et al. three groups (\nPrimary data extraction additionally included: characteristics statistically evaluated between responder and nonresponder groups and values of statistical significance. Each record was read for information related to the type of analysis (i.e., retrospective or post-hoc analysis), the number of sites where the research was performed, if blinding was used in the study, and if a control or placebo condition was included. We first organized records into one of four categories of interventions: 1) neuromodulation, such as deep brain stimulation or transcranial magnetic stimulation; 2) pharmaceutical, such as levodopa; 3) physical, such as balance training or sensory cues; 4) placebo, including sham surgery. In order to organize potential characteristics into similar groups, a question-based flow chart was used (\nFlow chart for determination of categories.\nDuring the primary retrieval we identified 1398 citations using the applied search terms.

With these results, we aim to bring attention to, and progress the use of, responder analyses in future intervention studies. Having more information on responder/nonresponder differences could allow for more personalized treatments for the motor symptoms in PD.\nThe heterogeneity of the outcome variables and cutoff values across the included studies was somewhat unexpected. Of the studies we identified, 23/32 used some form of the UPDRS as the primary responder/nonresponder distinguishing variable as it represents the gold standard for quantifying symptom severity [\nWhile the UPDRS-III is regularly used as an outcome and has published, clinically meaningful cutoffs, it is also somewhat qualitative and subjective. The inclusion of objective and quantitative measures, such as signal stop reaction time [\nFuture studies should work to reach consensus on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for key responder variables, especially the UPDRS-III, perhaps utilizing a Delphi survey of experts. For more generalized recommendations and discussion on responder analyses we suggest the review by Atkinson, Williamson, and Batterham, 2019 [\nFor those interventions classified as neuromodulation interventions, we identified three characteristics that were significantly different between responders and nonresponders and were additionally corroborated by a second study. Across all interventions, demographics such as age were most commonly tested. Responders tended to be younger at disease onset and this was significant for Habets et al. testing STN-DBS, but not for Hwang et al. testing STN-DBS [\nAs levodopa responsiveness is often a criteria for DBS surgery [\nFinally, Hwang et al. and Habets et al. both found that responders had significantly greater UPDRS-II scores, indicating reduced perceived ability to complete activities of daily living. Both studies also showed that responders had more severe motor symptoms according to the UPDRS-III. Across all 12 studies, eight tested UPDRS-III, and four found significant differences indicating that responders had greater disease severity. Only Fasano et al. did not match this pattern, and the difference was not significant. More severe motor impairment, both as perceived by the patient and as observed by the clinician, represents an important marker of potential improvements as those with greater impairments have more room to improve with intervention. This is a common finding across other populations, including individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [\nWhile the pharmaceutical intervention category had the greatest number of included studies, it also tested the greatest number of characteristics. Only a single characteristic was identified as Corroborated-Significant. A potential reason for the lack of characteristics is the fact that responsiveness to levodopa is considered supportive of a PD diagnosis [\nJoseph, Leavy, and Franzén and Klamroth et al. investigated different physical exercise interventions to improve Mini-BEST scores in individuals with PD. Both studies identified that responders had lower Mini-BEST scores at baseline (i.e., worse balance) and responders had less self-reported balance confidence via the ABC assessment. Additionally, Bella et al., found that slower gait speed and less accurate synchronization to cues during walking were also able to distinguish between responders and nonresponders [\nAdditionally, Klamroth et al. found that responders to their exercise intervention had significantly worse cognition according to the MoCA [\nWe did not expect to find placebo specific “interventions” when completing this review and decided to include any type of “placebo” in a separate “intervention” category to investigate if there were any characteristics that may distinguish placebo responders. Placebo specific reviews have been published exploring the potential effects of placebo on participants as well as determinants of placebo response, determining personality may be an important contributor [\nWhile we used inclusion criteria related to our specific concept, different synonyms could be used in the place of the term “responder,” the secondary retrieval of records was expanded to include a wider variety of studies. Future reviews may want to consider the impact of different nomenclature. While specific and detailed record screening procedures were selected to reduce selection bias, it is possible that studies may have been overlooked. In addition to expanding the search by using synonyms of “responder,” the secondary retrieval of records was completed independently of the primary retrieval to further reduce selection bias. Additionally, publication bias, in which positive results in clinical trials are more likely to be published and searchable, may have impacted the results herein. While we followed recommended guidelines for database selection, we did not search all possible databases, including Google Scholar. As Google Scholar may produce more “grey literature” than other search engines, this represents an important potential bias [\nWithin the 32 included studies, responders scored generally worse on many assessments at baseline, potentially suggesting a particular range of impairment within which responders lie. Based on the results of this review, we hypothesize that there may be an optimal point of baseline functionality at which to intervene with particular treatments. Although this has not been thoroughly explored for interventions in PD, this review provides a basis for future studies to identify characteristics that may guide more timely initiation of interventions. Assuming responder analyses of various characteristics can be reproduced, future studies should investigate the implications of selecting treatment based on likelihood of response. With the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence-based programs, a greater number of characteristics can be included in future work to predict more accurately those who are likely to respond well to specific interventions.", "content_for_embedding": "Across medical disciplines, there are continued calls for “personalized medicine [\nWhile the tailoring of interventions is valuable for all health conditions, the need for personalization is readily apparent for conditions with vast heterogeneity, such as neurodegenerative diseases.

Only Fasano et al. did not match this pattern, and the difference was not significant. More severe motor impairment, both as perceived by the patient and as observed by the clinician, represents an important marker of potential improvements as those with greater impairments have more room to improve with intervention. This is a common finding across other populations, including individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [\nWhile the pharmaceutical intervention category had the greatest number of included studies, it also tested the greatest number of characteristics. Only a single characteristic was identified as Corroborated-Significant. A potential reason for the lack of characteristics is the fact that responsiveness to levodopa is considered supportive of a PD diagnosis [\nJoseph, Leavy, and Franzén and Klamroth et al. investigated different physical exercise interventions to improve Mini-BEST scores in individuals with PD. Both studies identified that responders had lower Mini-BEST scores at baseline (i.e., worse balance) and responders had less self-reported balance confidence via the ABC assessment. Additionally, Bella et al., found that slower gait speed and less accurate synchronization to cues during walking were also able to distinguish between responders and nonresponders [\nAdditionally, Klamroth et al. found that responders to their exercise intervention had significantly worse cognition according to the MoCA [\nWe did not expect to find placebo specific “interventions” when completing this review and decided to include any type of “placebo” in a separate “intervention” category to investigate if there were any characteristics that may distinguish placebo responders. Placebo specific reviews have been published exploring the potential effects of placebo on participants as well as determinants of placebo response, determining personality may be an important contributor [\nWhile we used inclusion criteria related to our specific concept, different synonyms could be used in the place of the term “responder,” the secondary retrieval of records was expanded to include a wider variety of studies. Future reviews may want to consider the impact of different nomenclature. While specific and detailed record screening procedures were selected to reduce selection bias, it is possible that studies may have been overlooked. In addition to expanding the search by using synonyms of “responder,” the secondary retrieval of records was completed independently of the primary retrieval to further reduce selection bias. Additionally, publication bias, in which positive results in clinical trials are more likely to be published and searchable, may have impacted the results herein. While we followed recommended guidelines for database selection, we did not search all possible databases, including Google Scholar. As Google Scholar may produce more “grey literature” than other search engines, this represents an important potential bias [\nWithin the 32 included studies, responders scored generally worse on many assessments at baseline, potentially suggesting a particular range of impairment within which responders lie. Based on the results of this review, we hypothesize that there may be an optimal point of baseline functionality at which to intervene with particular treatments. Although this has not been thoroughly explored for interventions in PD, this review provides a basis for future studies to identify characteristics that may guide more timely initiation of interventions. Assuming responder analyses of various characteristics can be reproduced, future studies should investigate the implications of selecting treatment based on likelihood of response. With the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence-based programs, a greater number of characteristics can be included in future work to predict more accurately those who are likely to respond well to specific interventions.", "topic": "Parkinson"}

The exclusion criteria included camptocormia due to other diseases, inability to understand treatment due to cognitive decline, and inability to undergo inpatient treatment and rehabilitation for any reason.

TF indicated abnormal posture, where the thoracic spine and lumbar spine were bent downward. LL and TK served as indicators of lumbar spine flexion and thoracic spine flexion, respectively. SVA was used as an indicator of postural disorders to evaluate the flexion of the entire spine, including both the thoracic and lumbar spines, in the standing position. The effects of the injection were determined by comparing these indicators before and after the lidocaine injection. For each of the indicators – LF, TFLL, TH, and SVA – an increase in the numerical value indicated a worsening of posture, whereas a decrease in the numerical value indicated an improvement in posture.\nThe first case involved a 62-year-old woman with upper camptocormia. The patient had a history of lumbar compression and a right femoral neck fracture. She was diagnosed with PD 5 years prior and initially presented with hand tremors. One year before admission, she developed camptocormia, which did not improve after 6 months of medication adjustment. As part of the drug adjustment, the dose of ropinirole administered was reduced and ultimately discontinued. Upon hospitalization, she underwent lidocaine injection therapy, targeting 8 muscle points with the highest hardness values. After 5 days of treatment, the patient exhibited significant improvements in posture, both subjectively and objectively. Compared to day 1, TK and SVA improved on day 5 (Fig.\nTime series of whole-body lateral radiographs to assess postural changes associated with treatment interventions.

The patient had a history of angina pectoris and lumbar spinal stenosis. He was diagnosed with PD 2 years prior, with gait disturbance as the initial symptom. Camptocormia developed 6 months before hospitalization and remained unresponsive to medication adjustments. The patient underwent lidocaine injection therapy for 5 consecutive days.

Although the patient did not strictly meet the angular criteria for upper or lower camptocormia, his forward-flexed posture was sufficiently severe to interfere with basic daily activities such as walking and eating. Given the clinical impact and similarity in presentation, he was included to test whether the same treatment protocol would be beneficial in borderline cases. He had a history of acute gastritis and was diagnosed with PD 3 months before admission. His symptoms began shortly after the diagnosis was made. The patient received a 5-day course of lidocaine injections upon hospitalization, which led to subjective symptom relief (Fig.\nThere are few effective treatments for camptocormia, and lidocaine may offer a potential solution. A simple dosing regimen using a muscle hardness meter can be implemented by trained healthcare providers, thus negating the necessity of advanced equipment. However, the effect of this regimen is short-lived and requires repeated administrations every 3 months.\nIn this study, we evaluated the following indices: LL, TK, LF, and SVA. TF and LF are expected to serve as indicators of upper and lower postural disorders, respectively. SVA is expected to be an indicator of overall postural disorders. Although formal minimal clinically important differences for these postural indices have not been established, we considered any consistent improvement, particularly in the SVA, which corresponded with patient-reported relief, to be clinically meaningful. Future studies should aim to define MCID thresholds for spinal alignment parameters in camptocormia to support the quantitative assessment of therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, LL and TK are expected to serve as indicators of vertebral flexion. Evaluation of these indices revealed minimal and inconsistent changes in LL and TK. Specifically, TK showed modest improvement in Cases 1 and 4, whereas LL either worsened or remained unchanged in all cases. These findings suggest that the intervention had minimal effect on spinal curvature, in contrast to more consistent improvements observed in TF, LF, and SVA. However, TF or LF improved in each case, while SVA improved in all cases. Given that no improvements were observed in LL and TK, while TF, LF, and SVA exhibited improvements, this suggests that treatment does not improve vertebral flexion but rather enhances posture and overall balance. Overall, these 4 cases suggest that determining the injection site for lidocaine injections in camptocormia using a muscle hardness meter is an effective approach.\nIn addition, although we evaluated several indices in this study, only SVA improvement was consistently observed, even in cases with limited TF and LF improvements, such as Case 1. Although we used items employed in orthopedic spine evaluations and conventional neurologic assessments of camptocormia,\nCamptocormia has been suggested to be associated with dystonia, and botulinum toxin injections are generally considered for treating dystonia.\nIn conclusion, the results of this report suggest that lidocaine injection guided by a muscle hardness meter may be a potential solution for camptocormia; however, this study has limitations.
